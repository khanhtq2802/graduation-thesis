"Very well and professionally organized. Despite the big holiday crowd, we managed to see all the beauties of the exciting imperial city with the help of a very professional and friendly guide."
"It is forbidden, it seems, to enter. I tried for months to get WeChat working. It only started to work last night, my first night in Beijing. Then all the results and websites and mini projects for the Forbidden Palace are only available in Chinese. If you try to book via WeChat or directly on the Forbidden City website, there is no availability for the entire year. When I wrote to their customer service this morning to describe all the issues, they said I should use their useless website and contact customer service if I needed help. How do they think it is helpful sending someone in circles and ignoring problems with their website?

I tried Viator, which I have used a number of times in the past and whom I had cone to trust. I do not trust them right now. They sqid they were selling tickets and advertised them at the correct price but when I wanted to buy just one ticket, they upped tue price to more than ten times the official price. It feels like scalping to me when Viator has admission tickets for sale but wants to suddenly charge more than ten times the normal price. Perhaps Viator.com can explain to me why my perception is incorrect ."
"Everything requires booking, and you can’t seem to book a day in advance: more like 2 to 3 days in advance. ALL QC CODES GET SENT TO YOUR PHONE. Closed on Mondays. We couldn’t get in because of this, and so we landed up at Jinshang Park where all the locals go to for the view of the F City from the highest point in Beijing. Get ready to be pushed and prodded by a 1000 locals: sunday was plain awful., bit the view was good. BOOK FOR ABSOLUTELY EVERYTHING IN BEIJING!!!"
"A magnificent splendor. You will need more than one visit and it is near impossible to buy tickets without WeChat account. So, perhaps the government need to look into this. Be prepared to walk a lot and different season will give you a different feel and view of what life might have been in this grand palace. Take your time to enjoy every little corner as it all holds a fragment of history,"
"Lots and lots of walking, huge lines to get in just like Disneyland. Beware of bicycle tour, will charge you 3xmore at the end of trip!"
"Spectacular! The Forbidden city is massive, beautiful with lots of characters. There are many different area so it could easily taken up a day when visiting.

It is extremely difficult to get the entrance ticket and even the locals need to queue for up to a month. We used trip.com and the dedicated agent has helped us to purchase the tickets successfully.

The jewel exhibition is a must see though you need to pay extra for it.

Tips

Go a bit earlier for security check, it will take a long time as the Forbidden city is always full. Always bring your passport along as the security will check your tickets against your passport."
Plenty of stairs and walking but really worth the pictures and historic value of the location. Some attractions close early so please come in the morning. The exits are confusing and suddenly you may find trapped inside.
"An interesting place to visit if you can be patient when surrounded by thousands of people who are rushing and pushing about.

The architecture is beautiful, and there are notice boards in Chinese and English explaining what certain palaces and areas were used for. My daughter got a audio tour which cut out after 20 minutes, so I wouldn't bother with this service. Also I agree with the comments on scam tour guides. DO NOT pay some random person money to get you in quickly, but DO find a reputable travel guide service and go with a group or private tour as you MUST buy tickets before hand. We bought our tickets at 5pm, 7 days before our visit and all the morning session tickets had gone and there was limited late session tickets left. This had to be done via WeChat too, so unless you read Chinese, use a guide service.

I see a lot of reviews complaining about the local tourists, but this is China, this is what its like. We queued for over 1 and a half hours and went through 3 passport and bag search checkpoints before we even got into Tiananmen Square, and more queuing to get into The Forbidden City. Security in Beijing is crazy, its like going through an airport to get in everywhere, but you have to just be patient and when in the sites, if you need to bump through a crowd to see an exhibit or take a picture, just do it."
"Be sure to make advance reservations for any location/attraction you want to visit.
Be aware for scammers as we were met with a guy that come up saying he was a guide and had tickets for immediate entry to the forbidden city for CNY 700.00 ( US$ 97.00 ) for the 2 of us.
Yet when asked for his credentials he walked away just to come back later with a picture of his supposed credentials."
"Make sure to book tickets in advance. A truly stunning place to visit with so much history you really appreciate a knowledgeable guide. There is a lot of walking as it covers a huge area, so water and good foot ware essential. One entrance and one exit you keep moving forward through the complex. This has to be on your must do list in Beijing."
"Inside the Forbiddedn city is like entering a treasure chest of Chinese art. From sculptures to luxurious silks, to even a 47 foot long yuan dynasty fresco. The palaace is a must-see for anyone who is interested in hinese history, art, and architecture. It offers a glimpse into the heart of China's past."
"Although the Forbidden City is massive, some entered to spend the majority of their remaining life inside the outer walls without being allowed to leave. I like looking at the underside of ceilings, beautiful craftsmanship, and the wonder of magnificent colorsThe Forbidden City is a vast structure, and some individuals were once forced to live within its outer walls for the rest of their lives without ever being allowed to leave. Personally, I enjoy admiring the intricate details on the underside of ceilings, which showcase beautiful craftsmanship and a magnificent array of colors.."
"The Forbidden City is related to the Palace Museum in Beijing. The building of the Forbidden City in the Ming Dynasty. It was part of the rule of China's Emperor. These days, it has been renovated, the Palace Museum well worth a visit. It's in the center of Beijing. The main colors are red and gold."
Warning to foreign tourists; you must book 7 days in advance of your visit. We did not know this so could only walk around the outside area.
"China, especially Beijing, is always a treasure trove to explore. The forbidden city was everything i have hoped it would be and more. The rich culture of china was in full display. This is another must visit site. Although there is an admission fee, which is truly valued for money, if you ask me. Some of the actual palaces were closed, but i got to see a whole lot more"
"My 2nd visit to the palace. This time I got a tour guide to tell the history and it was definitely worth it. The map attached showed only where the emperor, empress and the concubines lived. It was pretty crowded. There is a restaurant within the palace with limited choices and it is pricey obviously. Don't forget to buy the ticket early. Don't think you can get the ticket the same day you visit."
"If you ever find yourself in Forbidden City without a tour, chances are you will only walk blindly and treat it as a photo spot. Take it from me: you will only appreciate the beauty of Forbidden City if you will know the stories behind it.

So I highly recommend that you book a tour with Mubus. Our tour guide is Michael and he is 100% VERY INFORMATIVE. We were the only ones in the tour so it felt like a private tour! During the 4-hour tour with him, I acquired a lot of information about ancient Chinese dynasties and emperors. The tour was really interesting because there is really so much that you will learn. Michael is engaging, even holding recitations with us in the middle of the snow. He is really passionate when it comes to ancient Chinese culture.

Ultimately, you will feel that Forbidden City is so much more than a tourist destination in Beijing."
"An absolute stop when in Beijing. The whole place is massive. Post covid, they now restricted the number of people entering the palace. So do pre-book your tickets before hand before heading down. It seems very popular and highly recommended to plan in advance to avoid disappointment."
"Spectacular! I was on a solo business trip so I hired an English speaking guide who explained every aspect of the place so well. Unusually for China there are no street hawkers around every corner trying to rip you off.
The buildings and their contents are so well preserved and presented that it’s obvious the Chinese revere their history.
There is a quality gift shop where skilled calligraphers will paint your words onto wall scrolls and glass or porcelain items.
I had my wife’s name inscribed onto the inside of a tiny perfume bottle.
The is also a Chinese tea shop where you can sample teas free of charge, but beware, if you want to purchase teas they can be incredibly expensive. I was almost suckered into paying £300 for some Ginseng Oolong. I bought the smallest pack and still consider I was ripped off at £30!"
"Amazing architecture with a rich history, from the 九钉门 (how only the royal doors will have 9 rows and 9 columns of 'nails') to the different functions of the various 宫殿 (太和殿，中和殿，保和殿，三宫六院) containing a total of 8,707 rooms, covering 150,000 sqm out of the 720,000 sqm premises. We entered through the middle door at 午门, which usually is used only by the Emperor, even the Empress can only enter through here once (on their wedding day, which are not many because usually most are already married before the Prince becomes Emperor). The top 3 scholars (科举的状元, 榜眼，探花) are also exceptions that are allowed to enter through the main door, once in their life when they make it to top 3 of the imperial exams. 

I enjoyed the place, it's breathtaking, despite the hazy weather, you can still the beauty of the architecture, the pure presence of the size (imagine how much they had to walk in the past and how they navigated this huge red-walled maze without Maps). The Emperor's throne was alttle underwhelming though, I had expected it to be bigger and more glamourous. 

Ended the day exiting through 神武门 after 2 hrs of walking in it. "
"A massive and beautiful place. 100% recommend.

We arrived via metro (not on a guided tour).
As foreigners you need to show your passports at many places.
First as we got off the metro.

Info for gaining tickets.
Previously you needed to email
Emailbookingticket@dpm.org.cn
to reserve only tickets ensuring you include full name, Passport number,nationality, date of visit and number of tickets needed.
They would then reply back via email to confirm reservation which you take to the ticket booth when you arrive to actually buy your entrance ticket for 40CNy.
Now, from an email I have received states you can visit website to reserve a ticket/s.
When you pay for your ticket at the booth your passport is your ticket so when you go through just show your passport .
The place is massive. It took about 4 hours to walk around (quickly), although could certainly take a whole day.
We were glad to purchase tickets at the separate entrance tickets for the treasurey (10cny) and clocks (10 cny). Both were worth it.
Overall the place is a massive beautiful place and I thoroughly enjoyed spending 4 hours wandering through"
"Visiting the Forbidden City in Beijing is like taking a trip back in time. The vastness of the palace is simply overwhelming - it's like walking through a hallowed, palatial and historical wonderland. It's so vast, it can take days to explore all the buildings, gardens and courtyards."
Very impressive for its age and size as covers a very large area old buildings but once you walked though the first 2 buildings just more of the same really till end..when you get to dragon lady house...great 1/2 day though
We had a fabulous mini trip for 4 hours with Maggie today.The scenes were fantastic the city incredible and Maggie did everything to make our trip memorable .Even at the end of the trip she helped us find our next visit.
The Forbidden City was beautiful and we felt goosebumps when we walked into the area. It's huge and full of history and mystery and can feel it as soon as you lay eyes on it. We were privileged and so grateful we made it here. Just superb and gorgeous 😍
"Depending on what type of travelers you are. If you are looking for take some photos, you need not to spend too much time in this location. Exteriors are pretty much the same.
If you interested in the history, then you need more hours to learn and understand the past.
For overseas visitors, do avoid holidays period."
"The Forbidden City in Beijing is like something out of a kung fu movie! Huge red buildings, fancy roofs, and this looong courtyard that's like fit for an emperor. I felt like Jackie Chan could pop out any second. But here's the buzzkill – there are sooo many people pushing and shoving to see stuff, and you gotta stick to this path, no shortcuts for wanderers. Still, pretty epic to wander where emperors once did – just bring your zen patience and you're golden."
"Very poor system for obtaining tickets for foreigners!
It is not just «recommended» to buy tickets in advance, it is MANDATORY: after more than an hour wait under the hot sun (no shade), they ask if we did send an email the day before… you can’t buy a ticket unless you send an email in advance with your full name, passport number and intended visit date for each visitor to this email address:
bookingticket@dpm.org.cn

The next day after receiving the confirmation email, it was the same story, standing in queue for 1.5 hours to be checked that you have sent an email (you don't get any paper tickets!?)
Getting in the palace area was another 1-hour queue, to check the passports and screen the bags.
The disappointing thing about all this is, you are not able to view inside the many palaces that are in the compound, ONLY FROM THE OUTSIDE :(
Take plenty of water and snacks with you, and have an umbrella to be in the shade. It takes at least 3 hours to visit the huge area and palaces FROM OUTSIDE!"
"Today we have a very good time with tour guide in the palace museum,Jeffrey speak very good English and helpful! The Forbidden City is a must see in Beijing."
"First of all, it is not just « recomended » to buy tickets in advance, it is MANDATORY: after 40 minutes wait under the sun they ask if we did send an email the day before… you can’t buy ticket unless you send email in advance with your date choice, name and passport number.
Same for tiananmen square.
Except this issue the place was magnificent. Be prepared, water, sunscreen and glasses because there is not much shade, but it worth it! The place is surreal!"
Angela was a great guide. She is very knowledgeable and fun! The forbidden city was great. Very interesting to learn the history.
"1、Entrance: The south gate of the Forbidden City is the main entrance for visitors, with exquisitely carved stone lions and archways outside and buildings in the architectural style of the Ming and Qing dynasties inside, which are very magnificent. It is recommended to purchase tickets in advance to avoid queuing.
2、Hall of Supreme Harmony and Hall of Central Harmony: Upon entering the Forbidden City from the south gate, you will first see the Hall of Supreme Harmony and Hall of Central Harmony, which are the core buildings of the Forbidden City and were once the venue for important ceremonies and political activities of the emperors of the Ming and Qing dynasties. The Hall of Supreme Harmony is the largest building in the Forbidden City, with three tiers of eaves, yellow glazed tiles, huge dragon pillars and the Jinluan Hall. The Hall of Central Harmony is slightly smaller than the Hall of Supreme Harmony, but is equally magnificent and was the venue for the emperor's enthronement ceremony and the appointment of imperial concubines.
3、Treasure Gallery: The Treasure Gallery houses many historical artifacts, including ceramics, gold and silver ware, and jade ware. The treasures inside are dazzling, and the most famous exhibit is the original painting of ""Qingming Shanghe Tu"" by Emperor Qianlong. Many national treasures are also kept here, such as the jade cong, amber drum, and the Forbidden City brush holder.
4、Qianqing Palace: The Qianqing Palace was the residence of women in the Qing Dynasty's imperial court and is now a place to showcase Qing Dynasty life. The building is exquisite and colorful, with an inner and outer palace. The inner palace displays the life and dress of Qing Dynasty women, while the outer palace showcases the architecture and lifestyle of the Qing court.
5、Palace Museum: The Palace Museum houses a large collection of cultural relics, showcasing ancient Chinese art and culture. The relics include palace utensils, ancient books and paintings, utensils, ceramics, and more, making it an important place to understand ancient Chinese culture.
6、Yihe Palace and Yangxin Hall: This is the harem area of the Forbidden City and also where the emperor lived. The Yihe Palace and Yangxin Hall are smaller in size, but very exquisite and colorful, showcasing the architectural style and lifestyle of the Qing Dynasty court.
7、Beihai Park: Going out of the Forbidden City from the north can lead to Beihai Park, a beautiful park with a lake and gardens, providing a great view of the Forbidden City from afar."
"Lots of things to see, and if you watched Bertolucci's movie, this visit will be even better. The visit takes quite a long time."
"I was very in a happy medium mood back then in the
summer of 2019 , I was 15 yrs . old at that time !!
and it was fun back then , we had to crave for ice cream !!"
this place so forbidden i couldnt even take a complimentary drink from them people. i wanted to go take a picture of the statue but this so forbidden i couldnt even do anything
"The Forbidden City was amazing, so much to see. The clock room and treasure room were also worthwhile the see. My guide, Clement, shared a lot of the history with me which made it even better."
Amazing structures. Lots of history and beautiful surroundings. People in traditional costume. Very crowded but well worth the visit.
The Forbidden City is massive. You can spend a little time there or spend most of your day there. It is really hard to appreciate the size of the grounds until you are in it. It is fascinating and the buildings are amazing.
"I’m not going to lie, I really didn’t know much about this place before visiting.

The size is phenomenal, but it’s also stunning to walk around. If you clear your head you can try to imagine how the empowers would have lived here.

Truly stunning. Worth every penny."
"If you are in Beijing this is absolutely a must see. We spent here around 3 hours, was super busy, a lot of people everywhere but definitely worth a visit.

We've had a great day - just make sure you get to the park across the street and climb the hill for stunning views of the Forbidden City and all of Beijing.
Highly recommended."
"Every time I'm in Beijing I try to visit the Forbidden City. The palace is huge and requires at least 4 hours to visit. A great place to know the monarchial history of China. A huge and beautiful, takes us back in time and shows us what it means to have inner peace of mind, you can feel it in every nook and cranny. Wonderful place."
"The Forbidden City is an amazing place that you absolutely must visit, but currently if you do not book your tickets at least a week in advance you will not be permitted inside. They will let you pass through Tiananmen and through another gate, but at the location where you used to buy tickets they will usher you out if you did not prebook. Really stunk after wading through the mass of people for over an hour to be then turned away. You can book tickets (and pay) on the trip.com website or app, but it currently is over 8 days out, so we were not able to enter this time. Oh well. It is an amazing place, just not for spontaneous trips anymore."
"It is a quintessential display of Chinese culture and history! Rows of buidings, rooms built for specific purposes. Tough only a small part of the entire City (literally) is accessible to public, it will tire you out just looking at that part! Your are awestruck even before you enter watching the area surrounding the City. It is very important you take a informed guide with you who will walk you through the City and tell details of each building/monuments. There is so much in there that even one entire day will not be enough. A must visit at least one in your lifetime!"
The area is astonishing but we met some scammers who kept selling us paintings and artwork and even asking us to use our credit cards if we don't have a cash on hand. June 2016
"If you want to learn about the history and culture of China, it's definitely not to be missed. There wasn't a lot of people when we came , we spent more than three hours here. We went to the Treasure Trove(Zhenbaoguan) , the artifacts there were the most beautiful things I ever seen, they are wonderful! I can't believe they're really made by humans. We also bought a cup of hot cocoa at the shop in the Royal Garden, they're really nice! It's only about two streets far from here to Wangfujing Street, you can go there on foot."
"I visited Forbidden City during the winter season in December 2019 and it was my first-time visit to Beijing, China. The Palace Museum, as it is now more widely known, is located at the heart of downtown Beijing. And if you ask locals how to get to the world’s largest ancient palatial structure, you will always be told “just go downtown and you’ll find it.” It seems easy to go around the city as long as you are within Beijing’s first 5 rings since most of the tourist destinations you’d like to go to are interconnected by their 23 railway systems. Tourists and foreign visitors like me are discouraged to be going around in private vehicles so my colleague and I had to leave our car in the hotel so we can take the public railway transit to get to the train station at Tiananmen Square. Always get your passport handy as there are security checks along the area just outside the train and before going into the Palace Museum or at the Tian’anmen Square. Getting inside the Imperial City is only through the Southern Gate, which is also called Wumen, or the Meridian Gate. The Tiananmen, or the Gate of Heavenly Peace, is the monumental entrance under the famous portrait of Mao Zedong to get to the Meridian Gate if you’re coming from the south. Forbidden City is normally open from 8:00 am to 5:00 pm, Tuesdays to Sundays, but it closes early at 4:30 pm during the wintertime. We reached Tiananmen Gate at 2:00 pm and we hurriedly secured our tickets so we still have time to go around. Entrance tickets are sold at RMB40 per visitor (priced at RMB60 in Spring and Summer) which can be purchased online, however, my colleague was having difficulty buying the tickets through his mobile phone at that time so we ended up lining at the passport window. The queues are extremely long so it’s best to purchase the tickets in advance to avoid wasting time and to spare yourself from the hassle and stress of going through a sea of people at the southern gate. Passports for foreign visitors like me are required for tickets to be issued, and I made sure it is always handy as it is being checked on several occasions before passing through the Meridian Gate. By rule, entering the Palace Museum is only through the south gate (Meridian Gate), and exit through the north (Gate of Divine Prowess). But the entrance gate in the east near the south gate, more popularly known as Donghuamen (East Prosperity Gate), can also serve as an exit point. From the Imperial Garden, it will take 18 minutes to get to Donghuamen, just in time before the gates will close. I highly recommend this exit route because on the way back, you can pass through the Inner Courts, Outer Courts, and the Inner Golden Water Bridges again minus the sea of people and you can take better pictures of the palaces, halls, gates, and sculptures without the photobombers. But you have to make it quick as the sun sets almost instantaneously before you can even get out of the Imperial City’s humungous gates (you may want to visit my blog page for the complete story of my adventure)."
"Visites in December and it was incredibly cold, so wear LOADS of layers. Incredible buildings, similar in style but with unique intricate details. The view from the hill above is a must and well worth a climb!"
"This is a must visit place to see the grandeur of the old Chinese dynasties.

The attention to details.of the design and architecture is amazing. It's a pity that we are not allowed to go very close to the exhibits, partly due to the need to preserve the antiques and also as a COVID measure.

The grounds are huge so it will take at least half a day to tour. It is best to get a tour guide for this visit in order to better understand the rich history of this place. They also offer audio guides for rental. Both are available at the entrance to the museum."
"Just a must see place when visiting Beijing is the Forbidden City. Definitly bigger than I imagine. It is a long way around to see most of the different sections.
Just loved it."
The scenery is beautiful but we waited a long time to get our tickets. The second time we went there they said the tickets were sold out. I suggest going here when they aren't busy.
"We were planning to spend whole day in the Forbidden city. But when we got there, they told us they don’t have any free tickets, all were sold out. They have limitation of 8000 visitors per day, one would say it is enough... obviously not. They told us we need to go to one website to make a reservation but the web was not working - only some chinese words appeared. Later on one english-speaking lady told us the tickets are sold out for next 14 days."
"Experiencing the forbidden city was no success. Visiting in September 2020 (still Covid time)
- Finding the entrance coming from Tiananmen Square was already a challenge, you need to walk a long way to the west side of the site (do not try to shortcut via park, it is not connected)
- Even if you bought online tickets (highly recommended), you need to queue up first for a ""Pre-check"" where staff will verify your health code and passport and confirm your tickets electronically (1click)
- Go to security check and ticket check (5min queue only) and you will be inside.
- Go through the several places and visit the halls but it is pretty similar and boring. You can see the thrones from 15m away and can t enter any of the building.
I have to say on that day it was not crowded, only try to avoid the big Chinese group or give them some space.
My opinion the garden in the end was the most interesting and relaxing...
Visit can be done in 1,5hour including picture time."
"The Forbidden City is to Beijing as the Golden Gate Bridge is to San Francisco or as the Brandenburger Gate is to Berlin or as the Colosseum is to Rome... An absolute must-visit for any Beijing visitor.
Security is tight, so book your ticket in advance and bring your passport. Bring plenty of batteries for your camera and/or phone, as you will be tempted to take hundreds, if not thousands of pictures. Also bring your walking shoes and enough time as this will be a days worth of walking around."
The Forbidden City is HUGE and potentially overwhelming. Travelling through this UNESCO world heritage site with Lars from Beijing Post Cards as our personal guide was like travelling through history. He brought everything to life with stories and incredible detail. The kids learnt more about Chinese history in four hours with Lars in the Forbidden City than four years of class. Could not recommend more highly.
"You have to have seen it as one of the world's major attractions. However, the biggest frustration of visiting this place is that you cannot get into any of the buildings. You can only watch from outside and from the internal squares."
"To get here you'll need to visit Tian An Men square first so you'll have to bring your passport to get in because they'll check it. After exploring the square which deserves a review of it's own, you can then take a tunnel underneath the road and arrive at the entrance of the palace; you'll recognise the image of Mao above the entrance. Once inside you're not in the full palace, you will still need to buy tickets later on and if it's summer then it will get very hot so you'll need some money not just to get in but also to get some drinks/ ice cream. If you're interested in Chinese history you'll be amazed by the doors, walls and even roofs of the palace since all of it is like a work of art. The palace stretches on and on and you can explore the main courtyards, the side tunnels and little buildings which have now become museums and shops. You'll see the vibrant colour and design of classic China and can learn some of the history behind the emperors who lived and ruled there; you'll even find the throne that they sat on, a golden chair with dragons resting on top."
"This used to be the palace ground of the Ming and Qing dynasties and hence is a must visit when in Beijing, to understand the history of China. As the grounds is huge, will take at least 2 hours to cover this attraction."
"Spectacular architecture, grounds, well preserved and maintained buildings. Lots of history and best learned through a guide tour or renting an audio guide. Much to see and absorb. I keep returning to see sections at a time."
"I enjoy the Forbidden City so much, The Detail on Every Building is quite amazing, Come when you get a chance, 900-plus buildings with a retinue of eunuchs, servants and concubines, until the Republic overthrew the last Qing emperor in 1911."
"I have been there twice. First of all, it is not recommended to go when everyone wants to travel. There are many people. You also need to queue up and verify your identity. There is nothing interesting in the Forbidden City. It is popular because it has a long history.And there are many precious cultural relics. In addition, some parts of the Forbidden City are closed to the outside world."
Expansive and very historical city showing the depth and breadth of prior Chinese culture. It was good to visit and do a lot of learning about the Chinese part of the World.
"Former imperial palace of the Ming and Qing dynasties. In 1987, the building was inscribed on the UNESCO World Heritage List. Historical place, but very crowded, and all buildings are very similar. The least interesting place that I visited in Beijing."
"This was the first of many temples and palaces. Could have spent hours here but was on tour, so we were rushed abit."
"I visited the Forbidden city on an early morning at the end of October 2019 and we have been blessed with a sunny day (really shining which I was told is unusual in Beijing) and a limited crowd of tourists. The place is huge but with a tour guide it took us a couple of hours to have a quite detailed visit, also because it consists mainly in strolling around from one building to the next. No possibilities to enter places. The initial part with the classic palaces is breath-taking for the vastness of the empty spaces (to hold the people in the past time) that indeed we had the privilege to see quite empty, though usually are full of tourists. I preferred the more cosy and secluded areas and houses where the Emperor's concubines were living including a garden on the opposite side of the main gate right before the exit. Overall a must-see experience that can be done efficiently even in a couple of hours."
"A huge palace complex where entry of commoners was prohibited in the past and hence the name “Forbidden City”. Its at one end of Tiananmen Square. Do carry your water bottle, something to eat, an umbrella. If you can’t walk hire a wheel chair. Entry is restricted and subject to checking."
This is a must visit place when you are in Beijing. We took the group there and they loved it. Gets a bit chilly in December though!
"if you are into history and art, plan a whole day to spend there. it's really big. try to buy your ticket online."
"It is a large place. You will walk a lot. But I didn't really see anything spectacular that I would recommend seeing. Maybe it's because it was 1-degree celsius. Maybe I don't appreciate historical places. But apart from the vast crowds, and the large place with no access to some others, it was all about getting from one end of the palace to another. The architectural designs are everything though. That I would recommend seeing."
Lovely place to visit- the splendour of the days gone by and the extravagance is astounding. Lots of tourists but didnt feel crowded
"We went just 1 hour after opening and it was really packed with people. We had a tour guide and it was very interesting to listen to all the great history. It's a place u have to visit when u are in Beijing but if possible choose a day when it's not to much people. We where literally walking in top of each other.

Its huge and it took us around 2.5 hour to finish."
"The palace is out look sure is impressive, the day we visited is winter and had been told is not as crowded as the peak season. Still is consider crowded to us.

Only visit the Clock and watch museum, all the visitor is busy taking photo of the exhibition.

To make the visit more interesting, advise to follow a guide who is well elaborate, or else, 1-2 hours will be enough."
"The forbidden city is huge. We booked tickets through our hostel. We went by subway and got off at Tiananmen East (can also get off at Tiananmen West). Once outof the subway, just follow the crowds and move to the Meridian gate (south gate). Only one way in. Move through the complex in one direction and exit the opposite way in front of Jingshan park. We spent about 2 hours touring the complex. Interesting architecture and big courtyards. Seniors age 60 and above get 50% discount but need to buy tickets at entrance. Our hostel couldn't book for us seniors tickets. The forbidden city is a must visit for first time visitors."
"I’m super grateful I visited, but boy was it crowded, and we went during a low season. It’s fun to see the history and walk the city, but I’m happy not doing it again. My advice: put it on your bucket list and just do it. You won’t regret it, but you also probably won’t do it again."
"We went in December to avoid crowds. Although the weather in Beijing is super chilly 2 degrees Celsius. But it is sunny day, bright sun helps. Book with a tour guide. Huge place. This is one of the main historical place u need to see when u go to China. Learn about Dynasty in China, how they govern day to day during Chinese Emperors. Our tour guide speaks fluent English. she told us, in summer, tourist can boost up to 80k people. But in winter , it's only 20k people max. security is tight."
The forbidden city is huge . It has so many buildings that were used for concubines back in the day. The courtyards are huge and it’s honestly beautiful.
"We visited during the 70th anniversary month and all the tickets sold out before 9am! We were fortunate enough to bump into an amazing tour guide called Tony. He suggested we'd get more out of walking around the outside and go through the Forbidden City gardens for a better view. When we looked down onto the city we realised why it was better. We really would've been shoulder to shoulder and not seen much, especially as most of the city is closed off to the public. From the garden hill we saw spectacular views and Tony gave us incredible cultural and historical stories and information. He also took us to places the general tourist wouldn't have known about and we ended up booking him for a 2nd day to take us to the Hutongs, silk factory, Summer palace, Temple of Heaven, and eat Peking duck,. Tony picked us up from the hotel, it was raining and he had umbrellas on the ready, he looked after us so well! I'd completely recommend him, he was so flexible and knowledgeable, friendly and good humoured. I'd done a ton of research and was ready to be the tour guide to my family, but our trip wouldn't have been as good without him by far. He'll customise the day around what you want to do and make it a day you won't forget. Here's his details: Tony Niu - tonyniu03@163.com +8613911825633"
"Just a must see place when visiting Beijing is the Forbidden City and was very impressive for sure
Was a lot bigger than I had imagined for sure and what a true testament to how something that was built so long ago how beautiful it was and how well it has stood the test of time
It is a long way around to see most of the different sections for sure but well worth the walk and to see so many very old trees as well
Totally amazing"
This will be a highlight of your China trip. Absolutely visit the Forbidden City while visiting China
"This is definitely a must visit went in Beijing. It is huge, so you will probably not be able to see all of it unless you spent quite a few hours there, but that is OK. I’m grateful we got the audio guide, as it definitely gave some interesting insight into the architecture, details, and some of the history. It was still a bit overwhelming and all of the buildings started to seem the same after a while. It is mostly walking around outside, and you can’t actually go in most of the buildings. But it is still quite a fascinating place to walk around. There are some interesting gardens as well. Be aware that you will likely exit a different gate than the one that you entered. It’s helpful to buy your tickets online ahead of time, which the concierge at our hotel assisted us with. We visited in June and were fortunate with a cloudy day, but if you are going in the summer heat, be sure to bring water and sunscreen."
"I traveled to Beijing in September, 2019, with a group of friends. I was responsible for arranging local tours in Beijing. I booked a skip the line tour of tge Forbidden City-The Palace Museums and Tianamen Square through Trip Advisor. It was well worth it! The Palace complex and Tianamen square are vast and filled with Chinese history. You would miss out on interesting historical abd factual information if you did not take the tour!
We booked a private tour. Our tour guide Jackie, met us at out hotel early in morning on the day of our tour. Because our hotel, The New World Beijing Hotel, is close to Tianamen Square and The Forbidden City, It took us 15 minutes to arrive at the square by tour van.
The square was vast and on the day we were there preparations were under way to celebrate the 70th anniversary of the Chinese Communist Party. It was interesting to see the construction of the viewing stands giant TV screens and banners for the massive parade scheduled for Later in the week!
The Forbidden City us also vast, with dozens of beautifully painted ancient palaces and adminstrative buildings, steeped in Chinese history and intrigue! Our tour guide Jackie was most informative, personable and professional and took great pains to provide us with a memorable experience of this amazing historical site! I highly recommend this tour!"
Beautiful historic monument that is a do not miss while in Beijing. The architecture is stunning as are the vibrant colors.Try to get there early.
I am a big fan of history so the Forbidden City was a great place to visit. It is basically a huge museum. I was surpised at how big it was. After almost 3 hour we realized we only saw a little of half of the place and decided to leave. But I recommend it for any history fan.
"Amazing place . We were there in jan , not so many people . Spend almost three hours until closing time . Caught the sun light just before the sunset shinning on the building , fantastic!! We were there mostly for phototherapy, did not spend much time on history in details . I saw some Tutsis having private guide, which we planned to try next time"
"The Forbidden City was so crowded that we didn't enjoy it. It is such a historic site that we felt compelled to see it, but the crowds are literally shoulder to shoulder. If you want to get up close to anything, expect to fight a thousand pushy people. I am a bigger guy and felt overwhelmed by the constant pushing of the crowds. For anyone smaller, this will be a horrible experience.

We will not be returning to the Forbidden City ever and will focus more on rural China, which is amazing."
"Walking into time is how I describe this site. Visualizing the various emperors walking through the grounds, visiting their concubines, holding court for various occasions is all mind blowing. The architecture is something that can't be described. Visits to the clock and jewelry museums were terrific. Pictures don't justify seeing things in person. It's advisable to have a guide explain things or else you won't have a good sense and feeling of things that make up the landmark. If you go on a tour and if there's an option for you to be on the grounds for 4+ hours I suggest you choose the longer time. There's a lot to see."
"Absolutely fantastic! The museum goes on and on and on. So much history and photo ops. I live in Beijing, and this is a must do!"
Great way to feel the history and and walk the grounds of the Emperor's palaces. You will need your passports to gain access through security and the grounds.
"Intresting experience, it would be perfect to visit the place with a guide to explain all the aspects of the monuments.
It is crowded but this is expected, you feel as walking in history."
We were lucky enough to be there on a day with no smog and blue sky. The numbers were down due to the New Year celebrations and fears over the corona virus. The open areas were magnificent but the exhibits in the Palace of Clocks and the other exhibits with jade etc. were overwhelming with all the pushing and shoving. I enjoyed the outside areas best.
"a vast and beautiful historical complex. if you want to see it take 2-3 hours. if you want to visit it you will need 1/2 day.
To understand the why was build like this you need to put aside your ""modern"" thinking way and try to dive in to the oriental ante EU thinking way. If you will look with EU or US eyes you will only see nice fortificate old construction. Try to be a ""local"" and you will feel the deep meaning of this place.
Do not forgot: the chines people's they have never been independent of their movement or way of thinking.
They have always been ""guided"" and ""directed"" and this is ""the way"": the emperor is a ""leaving god"" and the surrounding is holly"
"This place is way off the charts amazing. In the marvellous centre of the most politically correct and best country in existence. I love the way that China is a bastion of human rights freedom of speech, just an all round grate plaice. All the bs about not being very democratic abuse of human rights etc is bs and totally flake news.
This museum shows how and why the people and government of china is best."
"First of all, you have to buy tickets online. You can buy combo tickets which include the tickets for the museum inside the palace. If you have not bought tickets online and go there, you can buy the tickets in the right hand side office. Your ""Passport"" is the ticket. You don't need anything else. Chinese people can buy tickets via WeChat.

You can take a tour guide or any self service guide which is available in multiple languages. The place is massive. It's like a small city. And prepare to walk a lot. Without a guide you won't be able to know much of it. A must visit for anyone who is interested in world history."
"The Palace Museum is a must visit to Beijing even if you don’t like museums. It gives you a good impression of the very ling history and the importance of Beijing as a city. Recommend to take a guide. You can do it on your own, but it is a lot to take in except if you prepare thoroughly before the time."
"The forbidden City is nice to visit and maybe a must, if you are in Beijing. But that is it.
Be careful: There are boards everywhere for tickets at the entry. But no chance for foreigners, because it is all WeChat based. And there are a lot of “Guides“ offering help and their service. Decide by yourself, if you want a guide. The Ticket office is close to bag and Ticket Check on the Right Hand Side. DO NOT FORGET YOUR PASSPORT!!! You need it for security and the ticket to the city.
The Coal-Hill to take a look at the city from above requires a different Ticket."
"Be reminded to purchase tickets online first and bring along identifying documents for checking.
The whole palace was very big and required to walk a lot, a good walking shoes is needed, best is to book a guide so they can explained to you what are the features of the palace."
"I had a layover in Beijing on my way back home to the US that evening. I thought it would be nice to see something around Tiananmen Square. The Forbidden City stood out to me as the most iconic, so I chose to do that. We stayed at the Hilton about 1 km away so we could walk down in the morning, take in the city, and then catch a cab to the airport in time for our flight. As it's winter, the walk was brisk from the hotel. We stopped at a nearby mall to by some cheap Gap coats since we had left ours at home. Getting to the entrance was no problem. I had purchased tickets online with Viator and they tack on a convenience fee to skip the line. Probably worth it, since I wasn't sure if they took credit cards and my cash was running low.
We followed everyone else, and arrived at the security line by the front gate filled with local residents. Wasn't sure what would happen at the front of the line, but my passport worked fine as I was in the system from my online registration.
If you're going, the 2-3 hours some state to take this in is nowhere near time to do this site justice. It's HUGE and there's a lot of walking up and down steps and over thresholds. Remember, it's a palace and a fortress, not meant to be user-friendly. We didn't get guides, but that would probably be a good idea if you have time to spend and would like to know what you're actually seeing and where to go. There are so many buildings, it's difficult to know how to prioritize and also save steps that you'll wish you did later. We also got tickets for the clock museum/gallery and the treasure gallery, and it was worth the money. However, remember that there's a jillion Chinese, they don't really use lines, and it will be crowded and difficult to take in each piece the way you'd want to. If you're lucky and tall, you can take pictures over the crowd. I'd bring a selfie stick although I don't own one. It would have come in handy. Overall, it was epic and over the top, especially when you consider the scope and detail that was put into this place. I was glad I went, and could have easily spent a day or two going through each place taking in the artifacts and buildings and trying to relate to the length of China's history in that place. We left tired, but made our plane to the States on time."
"It is humbling to be walking and be surrounded by so much history. It is bigger than one can imagine, It is an amazing place!"
"Many people there, the place looks old and it is old. The place has many artifacts that are cool to see. You can take many photos there, be carful , it is crowded. there is a lot of walking. There is a lot to understand about that place. There are many rooms to explore. There is a big picture of Chairman Mao in front of the enterance. Recommended for a place you should viste."
"The Secret Palace is simply a must to visit once in Beijing. It will take most of the day to get to see all the beautiful palaces, but it’s really worth it.
You can rent English speaking devices to help you explain the history of the Secret Palace or you can hire an English speaking guide, but the price needs to be negotiated first and that’s likely to be costlier than renting the head phone device."
"On a very cold winters day we had a whistle stop tour of the palace. We had a very friendly tour guide who helped us understand the context of the palace. We never stood still as it was too cold and outside but the benefit was that there were not too many tourists.
The palace was beautiful and I would love to visit in the spring"
"A place not to miss for exploring when you visit Beijing, get an online ticket save much much time for you to enter rather queueing up for hours to get a ticket at the gate. So please please get online ticket form “Get Your Guide” or “Klook” or etc. to safe your time. A very wide place to explore so pls give your time about at least 2 hours for this place."
We were approached by a chinese man who said he was selling art. After he took us to his studio what actually was a room with paintings. He was really pushy and in the end we were paying 800 rmb for a paining that was going to be worth a lot in future. as Master Fu would be famous in a couple of years.
A must see if you are in Beijing just for the history. Incredible work in building these palaces. Allow at least a half a day.
"A vast area to cover; even tour guides encourage you to stay longer and see more. Off-season (I was there on Dec 27) is a good time to do it. I see some reviewers were disappointed—I’d encourage folks to read up beforehand, and watch the film The Last Emperor. You’ll get more out of it if you have a sense of who ruled here. Please plan ahead on food... the great majority of visitors remain Chinese domestic tourists, and they are not inclined to support stalls that sell snacks and drinks, let alone the sort of museum cafes or restaurants that are standard in the West. You’ll need some fuel for all this walking, but amazingly there is almost nothing to buy here (aside from the many shops selling expensive museum reproductions). Be sure to save some energy at the end for climbing up to the grand view of the whole Forbidden City from the park across the street on the north side (small extra admission fee), it’s cinematic and so worth the effort!"
"You really need time to be able to do this sightseeing. There is a lot of walking involved and can get very crowded at times. You get to walk through one building, through the grounds and into another building.
It’s best to get a guide to tell you the history of this place.
Plenty of toilets but often a lot of queues."
"This was my fourth visit to the Forbidden City and we wanted to see the treasures but missed it. Other reviewers say the hall of treasures is worth seeing.

The rest of the Forbidden City is an enormous sequence of grand buildings with roped off entrances.

It is jam packed with tourists, many in large groups.

You walk one way with the crowds from entrance to exit.

On a hot day there is almost nowhere to sit in the shade. There are some garden sections with magnificent old trees

It is worth seeing but it is brutal."
This was a must thing to do on my bucket list Steeped in history an incredible scale absolutely amazing
"Came on Monday and it was closed. Tuesday visit totaled 16km valking in freezing wheater and not even seen whole city, only entrance is at south gate and only exit is at north gate. Most palaces are not open for turists and not much history explenation is in english . Educate yourself prior your visit. We also wonder how did they heat thouse humongous buildings in winter, because there are no chimneys?"
"The palace of the ming and qing dynasty. The palace is grand and majestic. The place is very big and will need a few hours to cover. Can only enter by the south gate. Security checks will be done and all lighter will be confiscated. All the lighters will be send to north gate where one can go pick up the lighter but it will all be mixed together and is free for all. If time permits, after exit the north gate, can cross the road and head up to jingshan park for a nice view of forbidden city. Entrance to the park cost 2rmb and if got yikatong(metro card), can use it to tap at entrance and no need to queue for ticket."
"Once at the here, you see amazing buildings each as it’s own meaning mostly sacred figures. The further you go into the Forbidden city, things do get repetitive, but you really do have to go. You can spend as much time here as you want or as little."
"It is definitely worth a visit, it was raining and even though was great to see the place, the building, the details everything!"
"My first visit was on Mac 2013 during spring season. This is my second time and I choose winter season to see the Forbidden City with snow. What a beautiful palace where every place was covered with white snow. We bought the package ticket with Klook which including Hall of Clock and Hall Of Treasure.
Visited on Jan 2020."
"This does not disappoint with its many courtyards, gardens and rooms but a guide is essential to fully appreciate the grandure and purpose"
"I highly recommend this. A place of wonder. The guide suggests that 2-4 hours would be enough for the tour, but I spent 8 hours there and I would have stayed longer. The portable guide is very good but gets a bit confused, if one leaves the recommended route."
"We loved The Forbidden City. It is huge with massive open areas. We were lucky enough to be there at the same time as some Chinese actors, the women were dressed as concubines and the men in traditional dress.

We loved every minute here and could have spent much longer.

The Imperial Gardens are beautiful too."
"The place is surely famous and worth visiting for anyone. My hotel offered excursion there so I had the chance to go with the group. Nice and attractive construction. Great to feel this nice atmosphere! I mada some photos there wearing the costume of imperator, they were printed and I took it with me. I recommend!"
"this is a must for all travellers to Beijing, best to go on an organised trip ,if you are travelling solo as I was, Guide spoke good English. Give al least 2 hours to spend around the many attractions in the forbidden city."
"I found myself feeling slightly disappointed. Perhaps that’s just me, I don’t know. Somehow I had just been expecting more, judging from reviews.

But it was great to be in the middle of the The Palace that had once been forbidden for so many years, and imagining how grand it must have been way back then.

Definitely check it out, and draw up your own conclusions."
"We got our tickets at klook, Forbidden city+Hall of clocks+Hall of treasures. We just presented our passport, skipped the que. Very convenient.

Going here by subway, we took Line 1 to Tiananmen East exit.

I really enjoyed the hall of clocks and hall of treasures aside from going around the Forbidden city.

I highly recommend a visit to Forbidden city while in Beijing."
No visit to Beijing is complete without a visit to The Palace Museum and the adjacent Tiananmen Square. ID or Passport is required to access the Square and Museum. Tickets can be purchased by phone or at the ticket counters just outside the main gate.
"We have all heard about the Forbidden city, but why is it named that. I for one realised how little I knew about China’s history. The Forbidden city as it’s names is a place people where forbidden to enter or leave as the case may be. Very interesting place indeed to visit when you are in Beijing. Thanks again to Tripadeal for making affordable and interesting."
"The history of the forbidden city alone is enoughfor a week vsit, add the art work each piece has it'sown story and the forelore and a day is not enough"
A real must do when visiting Beijing city. Will make you realize how powerful the Chinese civilization was. Very surprised by the size of this city inside the city and the beauty of the different temples/palaces.
"Very simple walk. I got the free paper map from the tourist info center (a bit hidden-- in the same plaza as the ticket office).

As it is an off-peak season, it's not too crowded. Highly recommended to get the audio guide!"
I don’t think I have ever seen queues as long as those that presented the day we visited. According to locals though that was off season😀. Even so the smooth and organised manner of the entry points was a sight to see in itself. Once there the sheer size and splendour takes you right back in time. Truly worth a visit. If you don’t go on a tour pick up a pair of guided headphones and listen to the amazing history of the place. It will take a day to cover everything so leave plenty of time.
You watch the last emperor prior to going to this area. It gives you the thrilles. Why is there a starbucks in this historic building?
"I had my first time visit at Forbidden City in a snowy and windy day. Oh man, this is not joking, Forbidden City is very beautiful covered with snow but the weather can kill you if you don't prepare yourself. The City is huge, plan for your route. The central line is a must to visit, then decide to walk on left route or right route. Study different history beforehead or you may need to hire a guide. Get your ticket online first. Take the subway to Tinananmen East. You need to pass the security check. Gey yourself enough water and food. Those restaurants inside are always occupied. Visit at least once in your life, its worth."
Such truly amazing place! Would take at least a day to completely walk and explore the grounds of FC. Only managed to cover part of the palace on my 3-4 hour visit there! Will be coming back again on my last day in BJ!!!
We had a guide from our hotel when we came here. I have been here a couple times and feel that’s the best way to see it. We spent about a hour walking the 250 acres and seeing some of the different rooms. You won’t see them all there are over 9000 and the Chinese government will not allow you to see but a handful. We had to give photos of our passports to the hotel in advance to purchase tickets to get in. Make sure you ask in advance.
"The Forbidden City is truly one of the highlights when visiting Beijing. It is full of culture and history located just off Tian’anmen Square.

Admission varies depending on the season. The city is made up of several buildings and courtyards that was home to over 20 emperors for nearly 500 years. The architecture and attention to detail was amazing to see. Lots of photo opportunities!

Several gift shops can be found throughout the city where you can find precious souvenirs. They also have a few eating establishments as well.

You won’t be disappointed!"
"Well you have to visit this place if you are in Beijing. We spent here around 2 hours, lot of people everywhere but definitelly worth a visit."
Great day - make sure you go to the park across the street and climb the hill for amazing views of the Forbidden City and all of Beijing!
Interesting to visit but feels a bit sterile - the number of visitors means that you can’t get inside anything and so don’t see much other than the outsides or lots of impressive buildings
"Last month, during our tour of China, we spent a very full morning visiting and touring the Forbidden City. The Forbidden City is much, much more expansive than I ever imagined and the grounds stretched on and on. There was way more there than I expected with many, multiple gates through the various ring walls to reach the center and the Emperor's Palace.. The squares and grounds between each level or ring of the Forbidden City were very interesting and each gate we passed led to a new level of interesting buildings and rooms.
Make sure to leave enough time to thoroghly explore the Forbidden City grounds and palace."
super crowded. its an amazing historical place but there are more interesting places to visit where you dont have to look over 5 rows of people or get poked with selfie sticks.
"very huge place for visiting with many visitors. a lot of walking, so be prepared for long march from the drop off point and across the tian an men square"
"This is a must if you are in Beijing, since it was the centre of Chinese government for hundreds of years and has the history and architecture to match that importance.

As so many people have said, it is huge. We were there with a guide; that is very helpful in terms of getting tickets, finding your way around the complex, and (with a good guide, at least, as we had) getting good information on the importance of the different buildings. As others have said, however, there is quite good signage in English for many parts of the complex.

Having said that, if I were to go back I would spend parts of two days in this complex. The first day would probably be with a guide, and would be to refresh my memory about the place and get another overall look. Guides usually shepherd you through the complex quite quickly, but it still takes at least two or three hours to get an overview. The second day would be on my own, at my own pace, to explore all the various nooks and crannies of this huge complex, and that would likely take at least half a day.

Some day I would like to visit this again; it was fascinating. I would, however, try to go on a weekday. We were there on a Saturday, and the place was packed. Weekdays should be a little less crowded."
"Get a guided tour to miss the queues, and hassle of booking online as a foreigner. Urban adventures (Intrepid) are value for money."
"I spent two and a half weeks teaching in Tianjin and asked my students what I could do on my one day off given I'd never been to China before. About half of them specifically suggested the Forbidden City, via a bullet train between Tianjin and Beijing. I wasn't disappointed!

The structures and exhibits are impressive. It is amazing to see how the complex developed over the centuries, who lived where, and soak in the history. Being from Canada and living in the US, I'd never been anywhere so old and historic that was man-made. I went with my TA and her boyfriend, so they were able to give me some additional information and history about the different areas we managed to visit.

If you do not speak or read Chinese, nor have anyone with you who does, the English audio tour or an actual tour guide would be helpful. Had I gone alone I would have definitely taken advantage of one of these options.

I also recommend making sure you can check out the Imperial Garden area. The largest palaces are essential, but the gardens are incredible. It was incredible to see trees planted by humans that are hundreds of years old (and don't look like the ancient trees in, say, California).

There is more than you can see in one day. I was exhausted after five hours and could've spent at least another 10 to 15 hours in the area.

Security is also very high, understandable around a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Make sure to bring photo identification with you, you will have to produce it at least a few times if you spend a day in that part of Beijing.

The only trouble I ran into was trying to leave the site. It wasn't marked well and it took several attempts to figure out a way to exit the grounds and get back to the Metro. We ended up paying 2 yuan each to walk through a lovely garden to get us back out to the entrance. This may be more straightforward with a guide, however."
excellent place. It has shops and you can buy very cool keychains. Ice creams have particular flavours and has very interesting looks. The tour makes it even better. It tells you stories of the old king and/or emperor. I suggest you to go.
It will be the biggest mistake in your life if you came to Beijing and you hadn't visited this place. Culture lovers will be impressed with vast and huge complex that you feel its endless. Come early because you will literally need the whole day of walking. There is a coffee shop inside also. Each and every Hall has its own meaning.
The Forbidden City is just incredible. Don't expect to see it all and take it all in just one day. I would plan to come as soon as it opens as it can get very crowded. Book your ticket in advance and don't forget your passport as it is connected to your ticket. In fact don't forget your passport wherever you go in China.
"Entrance is via Tiananmen sq under the famous pic of the great helmsman. Our Chinese friend got our passports to be our entrance tickets. We didn’t do a guided tour, there’s quite a lot of information about the various palaces as you explore. It’s a huge site, you’ll need a good couple of hours to do it justice. It’s a lot of fun seeing Chinese girls in traditional costumes posing for pics. There are some extra exhibitions you can visit such as the hall of clocks (for a charge). Plenty of places for refreshments and shops with some very good souvenirs and gifts. If you only do one historic site in Beijing this is the one to do."
"The Forbidden City is impressive by it's size. If you spent a few days, by yourself, wandering around, you could see most of the viewable rooms. We only had a couple of hours so we had a tour and this gave us the highlights, some history and a few exhibitions to see. I wuld have loved to have been able to spend more time there but think it a must see even for a short time."
Lovely place to see and visit in beijing. Nice architecture. Very crouded at times. Stay close to your group.
"The place is grandiose, quite different from Europen castles but it is mind-boggling to see the size and the beauty of it."
"A must-visit attraction in Beijing, you have to allocate a few hours just to tour this place. Pack some water or food in case you get hungry, though they have some stalls/restaurants selling food but it's on the high side. Huge palace, and many beautiful spots for photo taking. Went in winter but there were still a lot of visitors exploring the place. Impressive and grand. You can also rent traditional costumes to have interesting pictures for your memory."
"What an architecture, mind blowing, i just visited the 1st gate of Forbidden city, as I had just few hours of time. If you are in Beijing it's a must visit place. Its in the Heart of the City."
"To period drama fans, this place is great to visit as you will get to see the original locations filmed and discussed in the drama. I also found that each visit brings different experience as each guide has his/her own stories and spots to share. Visiting with a group is easier as we could just enter. The place is huge. The architecture is awesome, so are the accompanying stories. Definitely a must visit @ Beijing."
"Third time around (before 1996 & 2008), although there are more beautiful places in China, it stays very impressive all around. Whether you want just to catch the atmosphere, or are genuinly historically interested, there is certainly enough for everybody to enjoy an afternoon. Clean & affordable. A tip: watch Bertolucci’s ‘Last Emperor’ movie on forehand :) Avoid Chinese Holidays."
Visited here in November 2019 and beat the crowds by entering around 815 am. Did not use a guide but manged to see enough since you can walk the grounds on your own. Even in november there were plenty of group tours but you can easily avoid the crowds since the palce is so large. We ended up taking a bus back to the south end near the entry point. This is a must see for visitors to Beijing. Lots of history inside these walls.
The Forbidden City is a very fascinating piece of Chinese history. 24 emperors lived here between the 1400s and the early 1900s. Gorgeous architecture!
just like the Wall you have to go to the forbidden city. One of the most important visits in Beijing . It hasn't changed in hundreds of years. so important to the Chinese that you must visit. they are so proud of the plac
"For such historic place, you definately need a guide. It cost around 260rmb.
It is easily accessible by train and buses. Expect ard 15mins walk with security checks. No lighter, spray allowed.
If you are game, after you reach the end, you can cross into another park, climb the stairs to get to pavilion that overlook the city and forbidden city"
"Had the coldest walk tour in winter but it was worth it. The magnitude of the Forbidden City with Tianmen Square, a symbol of Beijing and all of China, astonishes you. Touristy place and much surveillance so be ready for a security check."
A wonderful day treading the historic courtyards and seeing the grandeur of the many beautiful building in the forbidden city. Learning from our Chinese guide the history of the Forbidden City and indeed Beijing in general was a great experience. China is just a fantastic Country to tour.
"Such beautiful things showed all old good times of China. It is totally different with modern Beijing, but still worth to visit. Remember that book ticket in official web site before go there."
It was beautiful but make sure you have walking shoes on. There is a section where you can get dressed up in royal garb and have your picture taken on the Emperor's Throne. Our travel guide told us some amazing stories about some of the people who lived there.
"Went in December, don't need to pre order tickets. However that doesn't deter the massive hoard of crowds that patronize the place. Every nook and cranny filled with tourists making it hard to get a slow tour throughout. Still highly recommended for a Beijing trip"
"Let me start by saying ,its a huge palace so you will have to walk a lot , start early as the gates open at 8.30 am ,had a great English Guide named henry who not only had the tickets ready but was giving us all the information about the forbidden city and the history associated with it. If possible do take a guided tour which will be of great help to understand all the halls and the significance of it .its a must see to just feel the ambience of the palace which till few decades ago was forbidden for normal people."
"Go with a guide and if you can afford it, go for an intensive 4 to 5 hours tour. Get a guide to explain in details of the different part and design of the palace.

Overall, you will learn and be amazed of what the olden days can do, when technology and machines did not exist."
"The forbidden city has a spectacular history. It is truly something that must be seen, not to be missed. We purchased tickets at our hotel, not sure if they can be purchased there but everything went well. If you have a good camera you can take some excellent pictures. Make sure you read the signs that tells you the reason for each section. This is a very large facility so don’t think the initial section is all, there is so much more."
This is a magical experience in that the history is so interesting. Our guide explained the dynasties and the architecture so well. Expect a few hours of walking and bring water; it was hot in September. Such a worthwhile trip that I will remember forever!
Crossing the road from tianamen square via the subway you meet the crowds so get elbows prepared!! Why cant some nationalities learn to queue? It had snowed the previous night to the visit and this made it all beautiful. Much of the snow had been removed from the ground but it was still slippy in places. So much to take in a full day here would be no problem. Its a shame that the inside of the buildings are closed to the public.
"Forbidden city is a good place. You have to go to this place when you visit in beijing. Many places you can see. You have to go in the morning, so you can see all places around the forbidden city"
"One of China's top attractions. Wear comfy shoes and allow enough time, at least 2 -3 hours to make the most of your visit here. A knowledgeble tour guide or tour headset is a must to learn about the history of the Forbidden City. There are toilets with both Asian and Western facilities, and you need to take bottled water with you especially if its a hot day as there are no vendors selling water (or any beverages) at this site."
"Such an amazing site, has so many buildings it was impossible to see everything but well worth the visit."
"The Forbidden City is a bucket-list must-visit attraction. Read in advance or visit with a guide to put all the history in context. The place is huge. Linger and explore. It will be crazy busy most of the time. Perhaps try to go early. It will be hot and polluted in the summer. Less so in the fall when we visited. There are lots of steps and walking. There is little food and toilets, but there are places to sit. Westerners, especially tall people, might get asked to take a picture with a Chinese tourist. Go with it. Access vis cab or public transit as there does not seem to be much parking, but are you really planning to drive there?"
"The history and the architecture is impressive. Do not miss this attraction. Full of tourists, go early morning. There will still be a line-up of people but you're still better off this way. At the exit, you can try jianshaling park (right opposite the exit) for a view of the city. it takes 3 hours to complete forbidden city only."
"I did not find it fascinating in the slightest, it was a big square with crowds of people, I couldn’t see much, cannot come close to the buildings as people are everywhere. I saw a couple of pretty buildings in the distance and that’s about it! We were in a group of 20 people with a tour guide, I can’t remember a thing now of what he was saying. Internet is completely blocked in China, so you can’t go online and read about the sights in detail or research to make it more memorable."
The Forbidden City is amazing and is a must see in Beijing. Lots of walking and lots of beautiful buildings to see.
"This is worth a visit but honestly the crowds were unbearable, there seems to be no limit on numbers so actually seeing anything is difficult."
The site is so large that a person needs all day to explore and a guide with you would be best. Hundreds of years of history preserved in the centre of the city is a wonder to see.
"Forbidden City is a relic, one day is not enough time to explore the city. Has a lot to offer. However going at the wrong time can be hectic and crowded. We, a family of 6, could not go further because its too crowded."
Beautiful and perfect in the winter since it was not crowded. I would recommend at least 3 hours to see it.
"This is huge. The intricate work that went into the city is incredible. I would recommend taking a guided tour. By itself it is a breath taking place, with someone explaining it puts it over the top. Be ready to walk and take many pictures."
"犹如置身于宫廷剧里，亲身体验游走在紫禁城。值得一去也是来北京旅行必安排必去的景点。虽然人潮很多，但是专注的观赏建筑的设计，还是值得的。
Each buildings will come with stories behind and their meanings. Worth to explore and understand more about history."
"This place is huge! Get a guide and enjoy the history and beautiful buildings throughout the whole place. Unfortunately a lot of the treasures and beautiful furnishings are not here, but it is still worth the time and effort to go see this place."
We loved Forbidden City. The beauty and history is all encompassing. We hired an English speaking to walk us through. It was the best way to see it.
"This is a must when visiting Beijing. Make sure you buy your tickets online before leaving your hotel as once you get there, it's very difficult to get in without an online booking. The location, grounds and buildings are equisitely maintained. Take your time (2 hours min) as the grounds are very large and the sites are plentiful. Put on your walking shoes and enjoy."
"Actually we were lucky. We (2) got a private tour, as December is definitely not the high season there. Which is to say, the masses of people are bearable. Make no mistake, even then it is crowded. But not more than other sights I've been to.
Generally speaking: the whole thing is breathtakingly big. So, what remained is a feeling that our very good guide rushed through it. That is to say, we needed 5 hours :)
Anyway, there is so much to see, so many things to listen to and experience, it is not to be discovered in half a day.
We were lucky in a way, as it was the first snow in Beijing, so a lot of people enjoyed a snowball fight or just the rather pretty picture of snow covered roofs in some rare rays of sun.
My tip: bring good shoes. It is just WAY bigger that you expect."
"Make sure when you buy your ticket in advance that you add another half hour/hour for security. The lines are long but as soon as you are inside, where it is enormous, people flock to all corners. We loved every part of the Forbidden City!"
"Loved Forbidden City especially the history, architecture, culture and garden 400 year trees etc. I wish we could go in to the private rooms rather than take pictures from a window. Simply WOW"
"Architectural complex where the 24 Chinese emperors who succeeded each other for over 500 years ruled. The place is much bigger than I imagined, the buildings are beautiful."
"It was called The Forbidden City as the common man/woman were not allowed to enter this palace. The main courtyard to this palace is over 1 acre in size. As you walk across these grounds,wings of the palace open up in many directions revealing a variety of sections within.Corridors lead to rooms,courtyards,ponds,gardens.A total of 9,999.5 rooms inhabit this structure.One Emperor was said to have 3,000 concubines at this location."
This is a fantastic place to learn more about the history. Fantastic buildings and this is a must to visit when you are in Beijing
"The Forbidden City; is a huge palace complex of more than 9,000 rooms where 24 emperors of the Ming and Qing Dynasties lived; is a must follow-up, post visiting Tiananmen. It is a few minutes’ walk from Tiananmen. The palace complex is massive and it resembles the grand palace in South Korea.

SEE photos."
"Pretty good tour that included the forbidden city and great wall of china, and also threw in the jade factory...which was probably a sales gimmick. The guide was knowledgeable and the forbidden city was well worth the visit."
"Loved the video that showed the making of the buildings, all wood no nails and so intricately made. 2 thousand servants!!! Everything was just amazing. To be royalty in that time in history. WOW. We bought the book of the forbidden City in the souvenier shop, the pictures and content reallu do take you back to the period."
"After seeing the last emperor, going in to the old buildings of Beijing gives to the thrilles! So nice. Beware of people selling you paintings, it seems like a scam"
"Amazing history. You need almost two days to see it all. Cannot go into the rooms. All I can say is what an experience, but be fit and ready to walk a lot!"
"Definitely, definitely worth a visit. Be sure to have your passport with you for the security checks at the entrance. Wear comfortable walking shoes and be prepared to walk a long way. Sometimes the surfaces are uneven and there are a lot of stairs. The Temple and Halls are impressive and awe-inspiring, beautifully preserved over the centuries. There were crowds but we were still able to see everything."
"The Forbidden City with its gardens and parks is a beautiful area in central Beijing. The buildings are amazing and the gardens are absolutely perfect. We spent a whole day walking around and still didnt see the whole place.
It was busy but manageable and as with all things in Beijing - dont wait or you will get stampeded. Just go with the flow and its really easy.
Would definitely go back but you need time not just a couple of hours."
"Awesome muesum and history over 2000 years ago built by the Emperiors of Ming and Quing dinasty, Forbidden for centuries but now goverment has opened to the public
Be prepared for much walking and a lot of stairs, not for physically challenged, some limited areas. Well work the price!"
Well worth the visit but be prepared for a long walk it seems to go on forever. The history is amazing and the buildings fantastic. As everywhere in China be prepared to be bumped and jostled in the attractions.
Palace used by the Ming and Qing emperors. There is a painting of Mao at the front. Huge queues here. Lots of gates to walk through and the inner court and outer court palace halls. You can't go into the actual palaces but walk around the outside. It takes a couple of hours with the crowds.
Awesome! Amazing trip. Once forbidden but now visited by many. The scope of the plaza was crazy. I would recommend this trip for anyone. Be prepared to walk and see every corner of the plaza.
"Amazing history of the forbidden city, we went with our tour group and had ear pieces to wear while he told us the history, amazing how large it was, such a privilege to visit such a beautiful sight."
"I have been on many tours, so of course I have been to the Forbidden City many times. I think people expect buildings, but it is primarily just walls. Without a good guide, it is very boring. There are few opportunities to see anything inside the buildings, like a bed, so mostly it is just what you see in pictures, red and gold with a lot of cute dragons on the roof. Once there was a starbucks inside but it is now replaced with another coffee shop."
"This place is definitely worth a visit. From the entrance through Tian Anmen Square and its history to the various gates and in to the inner Forbidden City your mind brings together pieces of history and places it in context. We had an awesome guide, Eve, who absolutely made history come to life. We did the outer gates without her and it was vaguely interesting but when she took us into the inner city and started to explain history, architecture, customs the city became fascinating. Unbelievable how the used interlocking wood instead of nails or glue to keep the buildings together. Many more facts I could share but don’t want to spoil it. I am so pleased we visited."
Most of the buildings look alike but the thousands of people visiting provide plenty of opportunities for some wonderful photographs. The area where the concubines lived were crowded but interesting. Probably a good idea to get in here as early in the day as possible.
"This is a huge complex and could be overwhelming and boring without a guide so pay the price for a guided tour. Lots of great photo ops but waayyyy too many people, even in November. So plan accordingly but do include this in your travel plans."
Beautiful palace with tons of intersting history. Nice building structure. Can spend entire day in this place.
The grounds were well kept. I bought a self guided tour and although it seemed expensive really did add to the history of the palace. I disliked that there were several areas not included with the entry fee which was not very clear originally. More signage is required letting people know where to line up to purchase tickets. But once sorted out it was a lovely time walking around. I spent 5 hrs and did not complete everything as it is an incredibly large area.
It is a must see when in Beijing. It exceeded my expectations and it is an incredible experience. Please note that tickets cannot be bought in site and has to be done over a website. Ask the hotel to book and your passport is then your ticket.
"A most rewarding experience and a must place to visit while in Beijing. There is so much to see, but avoid the weekend as it gets very busy. The buildings are ornate and are restored to a high standard."
"On November 6th 2010, we visited Tianaman Square and Forbidden City with Tony and Jessica. They made are trip very enjoyable and comfortable. Tony took us to the authentic Halal Chinese restaurant where we had our lunch and then he took us to buy some green tea. Now it was time for our flight. Tony took us to the airport and we had to say goodbye to him. We will use this company again and refer to our friends and families.

"First is Tiananmen Square for some great Pics. and than into the Forbidden City. This is a massive complex with courtyards inside of courtyard. Very unique architecture from hundreds of years ago. A very good look into Chinese culture. You cant rush it, It takes hours to go through and appreciate this Place. A Must Do ( Wear good walking shoes )"
The place is massive. Steeped in history. Courtyard inside courtyard and truly magnificent in size and structure. Definitely a Lok into Chinese culture and its royalty.
"Forbidden city is great destination to visit if you goes to beijing. You have to drop off at Tian an men square and walking on soomething like tunnel then you arrive on Forbidden city. It's so far, so if you go to there with wheelchair it's so difficult. Dirty restroom, smells not good, you have to bring a lot tissue.. Haha.. Because almost all place on china is dirty's restroom."
Part of a tour with Monograms. Excellent guide gave a good history lesson which made this even better. Be ready to walk.
"A must see in Beijing and very pretty place to walk around. Get there early to avoid the crowds and to have time to see everything (half day minimum if not full day).

I paid 40rmb for an audioguide, which I found a waste of money. The device tries to be too clever by detecting where you are and start/finish audio track accordingly. But it does not work properly. Either it does not launch the track, or it starts it too early, or finishes it abruptly... without being able to listen to it again because it thinks you’ve already listened to it... or if you’re lucky, it starts again with a track for a different place.
But the places is better visited with information, so find alternatives (self-guided or guided).

Passport is required as it serves as your ticket once you purchase entry. Entry can be purchased there by scanning a QR code and paying online, this avoids queuing at the ticket office. WiFi is available on site but requires Chinese phone number, so go with data."
What an awesome place to visit! We loved the historical experience of walking these grounds that emperors and great men and women have walked for hundreds of years. You must experience for yourself.
"This used to be the house of the emperors of the previous dynasty and was closed to the public open only for royals and the ministers or higher ranks in their society,at the end of the last dynasty and the war it is now open for public to see. It's a long walk just one way if you enter form the back and there is a different exit. Nice picturesque view of the old dynasties."
Great place to visit. It is sometimes unbelievable to see what the kings did during their reign and that now new generations cannot even follow.
"Feel privileged to see a city, once meant for the royal family only. Recommend comfortable footwear, plenty to walk around and see."
"We had 3 hours to visit The Forbidden City and had every intention of just ""browsing"" around ourselves. Before we got there a man approached asking us to hire him. He was kind of rude and I didnt like his style so we said no. As we got closer, another man very clean, courteous and great English asked politely if we would be interested in a guide. He explained the benefits including him purchasing advance tickets online. We felt good about him and said yes! Best $40 ever!!!!!!

When we got to the entrance the lines were huge! He walked us over to a separate entrance and we went right in. The place was packed!!!! He said it was a slow day, only 30K TICKETS SOLD! capacity is 80K per day. That is way to many! You are just packed in there to start. He knew all the history and even his to maneuver around the tour groups!

He even took us to the gardens across the street that the tours do not go too because of the hill climb. At the top you. An see the entire city of Bejiing...well maybe if your eyes are good enough!

The weather was super windy and cold but that also meant no smog!

If you're limited on time hire a guide! Our experience was awesome. I have his contact info if anyone is interested!"
really impressive set of buildings but can get very busy. Fortunately our guide was great and knew how to miss the main traffic.
"Wow this place is very large We had a tour guide and see was great
You walk for a long time but it is worth the time to see this place"
So beautiful and so much history! Plan a day to spend here to see everything! Must see in Beijing! There are so many cool things to read about and see.
"This was an amazing place to visit. It crowded with tourists and I just wish we had more time to see everything, but time was tight. It a huge area that we had to cover."
"Bruce Wei was our guide, it was amazing to hear the history behind this beautiful city, and how they lived."
"Visiting the Forbidden City is unique, and it goes on and on and on...it is huge! There are limited places to rest but is doable but is more difficult for those with physical limitations (but it can be done). Expect huge crowds of people who are not always the most polite as they are used to pushing to get into their place in lines."
"We stayed at The Kapok Hotel, about 15 minutes walk from the entry point, excellent location and a day spent at the Forbidden City is definitely a memorable one."
"Everything in China is x1000 because it was a weekday, non public holiday and school day. Yet there were tonnes of domestic tourists. This is the sheer economic power of the Chinese consumers. Alighted at Tianmemen East subway, turn right and just follow the crowd. Foreign tourist, always bring your passports, security scans everyone at some historical sites. Enter the Forbidden city by walking through Chairman Mao huge picture and walk to the ticket counter if you have not bought it online.
You can spend the entire day here if you want to explore east and west parts but recommended to follow the middle path. Also north east has stone type wall which you do not want to miss. On the east side also, there's some burnt down ruins which is also good. Exit at the north end and now they have a Russian exhibition for free. Opposite the north end is the Jiangxi park which is majestic."
The Forbidden City is of quite large area. Going from one to another square the buildings look almost the same. Once you get into the garden it's all different. Spectacular experience in many ways.
"I took a private 3 hour tour with an English speaking guide and absolutely enjoyed the entire experience. Prior to the completion of the tour, my guide showed me where else I might want to go when exploring on my own. I took two more hours viewing the treasury room and the clock and watch rooms, as well as various other buildings holding libraries and writing rooms, I had an opportunity to relax and spend a good amount of time in the Imperial Gardens. Then on exiting the city I went to the park across the street and climbed to the temple above for a panoramic view of the Forbidden City. The entire experience was priceless and very profound as truly a once in a lifetime experience. I would recommend a visit to all my friends and family; however, there’s a tremendous amount of walking, so each will experience it in their own way."
"The whole of the Forbidden City is huge, 980 buildings, all comprising the Palace Museum, AKA Forbidden City. Be prepared to take your time to take it all in as there is so much history and information to be learned here. As the day wore on, the crowds got denser and denser, which gave me multiple opportunities to people-watch (which is just as interesting to me as learning about all of the dynasties that made this huge plot their home from which to rule their kingdoms. Check out my photos). Try looking up almost as much as you look forward/down to see the beautiful roofs and hilltop pagodas, check out the size of the furniture to assess how Chinese from years past were not as tall as now, make sure to run your hand over the metal balls on the massive entrance doors as, according to Chinese tradition, doing so brings good luck. Lastly, look around you at the goings-on of people and that, too, will enrich your experience here."
Good place to review and learn history. A lot of information . One can compare the styles of kingdoms of different nation's . A lot of walking needed. There stairs going up and down. We took the personless guide . But taking a real guide would be more beneficial to learn.
The Forbidden City and Palaces are truly one of the top attractions in China. This attraction is considered a national treasure in China! The City is a complex web of over 90 palaces and courtyards featuring palatial architecture and sculpture. Plan to spend 4 hours here at least. I have photos attached to give you a preview of this splendid attraction.
"We went in at 3pm, no crowds whatsoever, no queue to get tickets, no queue to get in, no queues around the palace bottlenecks. Two hours was enough time to see the palaces and the gardens at the back, we did this as a guided tour optional and paid a lot more than the gate price, you go in on the gate at the square and come out the other side, the quickest way to get there is through the forbidden city so if considering doing yourself find out about how to reconnect with your tour."
"We arrived just after 8am on a Tuesday morning and the place was heaving. First there was the usual long queue for the ID check for Tian an men square and then we had to join a crowd of football crowd proportions and were swept along with them over one of two bridges into the garden in front of the entrance to the Palace Museum. Once inside the Forbidden City there were many many tour groups and school parties all queuing to get up the steps to the 3 main halls. Actually no-one was allowed to go into them, just round them so we went off to the side away from the crowds and down one side where it was much quieter and much more pleasant. We soon realised though that we would have to go back and join the throng in order to get to the western palaces. Disappointingly, all but one were closed to visitors and the one that was open had been destroyed by fire. OK so you can't go inside most of the buildings but the place is worth a visit for 2 reasons- number 1 the sheer scale and grandeur of the place and number 2 the view of the rooves of the palaces if you walk the ramparts to the western arrow tower and then continue south. Not many people find their way up there (we went up near to the northern gate) so it's quiet and you can get some great photos. Also whilst walking along the northern part, you get pretty great views of the Jing Shan park, just across the road."
This is one of the 'must do's' in Beijing and is fascinating and wonderful but without a guide you would miss a lot. Expect crowds!
"Something I have seen on TV but never thought I would see by my own eyes. So worth going to see, so many people."
"Amazing place - hard to believe quite how old it is! I loved the courtyard of the concubines. Our local Wendy Wu Guide, Cindy, certainly knows her stuff!"
Amazing place to go and visit. Allow a few hours as these place is so big! Stunning architecture and beautiful colours are a delight to see. The history is incredible. Must see if you get a chance.
Shows China's long history of dynasties and great civilization. Beautiful palaces and the life style of the king and their families.
"I went to their official website to purchase the entrance tickets but to no avail as they don't accept foreigners. At last, I bought the tickets through Klook.com. I didn't want waste my time to purchase and visit on the same day. Luckily I didn't, the place is incredibly huge that we walked from 9am until the closing time - 5pm and skipped several small places!
FYI,
1) if you did not make online purchase of the tickets, you can buy at the main entrance of the Forbidden City, called Wumen, after going through Tiananmen.
2) If you have made online purchase, the only document they use to verify is your passport. Of course, it's better to bring along the ticket voucher.
3) Bring enough water and some snacks. The food sold in the palace is very expensive.
4) Be aware that the palace is going to be overcrowded. This means there is long queue everywhere! The ""cutting queue"" phenomenon is not surprising though.
5) Renting the audio guide is recommended as it helps you to understand the history or stories in the palace, making your trip more interesting. There is a map with routes at the back of the device.
6) GPS works in the palace. Just check with your phone GPS whenever you are lost.

Hope the above help you to achieve a pleasant trip!"
"This is a huge area, and must see. There are lots of little hidden and not so hidden smaller museums within. Take a tour book or map with you! We found a costume museum only because I had to go to the bathroom! The complex closes 4.30 and they start chasing you out earlier. We managed to get the last tickets before closing for the treasure museum (sth like that) that has a lot of jewelry and gold and silver - at 3.30."
Superb Ms. Candy is very accommodating. she explained everything. It was an amazing tour and we learned a lot from the history of China. Candy was very entertaining. Thank you you so much Candy for your effort!
"Very interesting place to visit to grasp some understanding of the Chinese culture, architecture and lives of emperor and the imperial court.

It's easy to enter once you've purchased tickets online prior to your visit. Just ensure you bring your passport along together with the ticket voucher. They will verify your identity through your passport.

There are wheelchair rentals for those who may find it difficult to walk on long distance especially for elderlies. This is a huge area so there are lots of walking.

There are many local tourists from other parts of China visiting here starting late morning ~11am until 3-4pm making it very unpleasant and overcrowded especially inside clock museum/treasure museum.

Bring water and some snacks with you otherwise you could still buy some inside the place."
"Of course we all have in mind the movie ""the last Emperor"".By when you enter into
this tremondous ensemble of pavillons you stay stunned.Speechless."
"Very nice place with plenty to see. Do highly suggest that you get a tour guide so that you know what you’re looking at and a little of the history. Very crowded, you cannot go inside the buildings so its basically looking at the architecture and listening to the history. Highly recommend it."
We visited as part of a tour group so only had a couple of hours which wasn’t enough. We could’ve spent much longer there if given the chance.
"Having read about the forbidden city and seeing it (the mock up) in many movies, I was thrilled to get to see it and to walk the same path taken by the Ming and Qing emperors and their families and officials.
It is a pity we weren't allowed to enter the buildings to view the artifacts."
"We visited the Forbidden City the week after the 70th anniversary celebrations of the founding of the PRC. Perhaps many Chinese tourists had taken a vacation to coincide with the anniversary, but vast as the Forbidden City complex is, the large crowds made the tour unpleasant. We were swept along in a sea of people, many wearing the same color hats, following the flags of their tour guides, so that there was little opportunity to view and enjoy the buildings up close. For some reason, many of the ramps from one part to the other were closed so the crowds were even greater on the few available ramps. Highly recommend one check on when would be the best time to visit, both in terms of air pollution and number of people likely to be there."
"We visited the Forbidden City as part of an organized tour through our hotel and although we tend to temper our expectations when it comes to popular tourist attractions, we couldn't have been more disappointed here!

From the minute you enter the outer courtyard you know its going to be a gong show with the sheer number of people trying to funnel through the entrance, which in itself is an exercise in chaos. This seems to be one of the few Chinese landmarks which is visited primarily by Chinese tourists / tour groups and they are relentless!
Getting through the initial security check was the epitome of madness with hundreds of people pushing and shoving their way through with absolutely no crowd control, and then when through to the other side its more organized chaos with the large tour groups marching through the site like cattle.

Sadly the site itself is really nothing more than large courtyards which fill up incredibly fast with raging tour groups and then funnel into choke points as thousands of people try to push down the same staircase and through the same narrow openings.
The only area which was remotely interesting was the garden at the North end of the venue, which would normally be very relaxing and even Zen if not for the throngs of people pushing and moving through, all chattering non stop which really destroyed any sense of calm.

Sadly i would not recommend nor return here in future as its really not worth the aggravation or frustration"
Overwhelm is the word that comes to mind when we visited. The attention to detail on the buildings. It truly is an amazing place and a must see.
"Very impressive and very large. We were overwhelmed by how very large the Palace is. After about 3 - 4 hours of walking, we got very tired. This was because we did the Mutianyu just the day before. Our advice would be to rest up the day before with an easy-going day before taking on the Palace Museum. Very beautiful and extremely worth seeing - not to be missed. And yes, have your hotel concierge book the tickets for you in advance. Go early as there was a huge line-up when we got there at around 11 am."
"A must see place when in China , all the buildings are very similar and you can not go in most of them, being on a tour we walked to the front of queues and over to main parts , there is lots of walking but for me this was not my favourite place we saw , thought on a personal note thought the summer palace was much better and not so packed.
."
A must see for anyone visiting Beijing. Just let your hotel concierge book the tickets in advance - the website is only in chinese.
"The entrance is impressive after arriving at Tiananmen East subway station. On the big entry wall is the portret of their former spiritual and political leader Mao Zedong.I recomand to ask for help at your hotel to the purchase of an on-line ticket, if so all you need to enter is your passport. Prepare yourself to meet a lot of people, chinese people.
Big temples, small temples, beautiful gardens, a lot of history, enought to enjoy a half day outdoor."
"When we planned our trip to China, every review, forum and website told us that The Forbidden City in Beijing is one of the ""must-see"" attractions in China, along with the Great Wall and the Terracotta Warriors.

Well, let me tell you what a massive (literally) disappointment it was. You have to book your ticket in advance as numbers are ""limited"" to 80,000 visitors a day – that's the entire population of Scunthorpe. You then have to queue for hours, go through airport-style passport control and bag scanners before being herded through a massive red gate house with yellow pagoda-style roof into the first courtyard. At the back of this courtyard is another massive red building with yellow pagoda-style roof nearly identical to the one you just went through. Beyond that there is another massive red building with yellow pagoda-style roof nearly identical to the one you just went through... it's like a Russian Doll nightmare that repeats a further six times! Off to the sides of these endless courtyards are other red buildings with yellow pagoda-style roofs – none of which you are allowed to enter! I wasn't quite sure what I was supposed to be impressed by except for the large amount of dark red paint that they had obviously bought as a job lot as everything was painted the same colour. There were flourishes of detail and colour in some of the smaller buildings but by the time we found those we had walked about 15km and were a bit knackered and dizzy from wading through herds of tour groups.

TOP MONEY-SAVING TIPS FOR SEEING THE FORBIDDEN CITY:
1. Stand outside one of the big gates and just imagine seeing that same view eight more times.
2. Go to Jingshan Park to the North of the complex, pay the equivalent of 30p to climb up to the temple and look down on The Forbidden City, marvelling at it's size and splendour from above."
"Being an iconic landmark in Beijing we of course had to visit. The entrance is impressive after arriving at Tiananmen East subway station (note: you need passports ready just to get into Tiananmen square, let alone the Forbidden City). Entering into the Forbidden City sees you go under multiple huge walls that all look the same, then you come to the ticket purchasing and entrance area. It is slightly confusing if you're not Chinese and don't already have a ticket; cash payments are processed in a few small windows to the right (when looking towards the Forbidden City) and your Passport number is used as the ticket when you get to the entrance.
Inside there is a lot of walking but the temples are impressive, albeit a bit repetitive/similar, and many were down shut off roads. Definitely the biggest issue was the number of people, you find yourself nearly being pushed off stairs when walking up and thrown into mosh pits at the viewing points for some main temples, so it can be slightly daunting. They have a limit of 80,000 people and I assume it was not reached on the day we visited so I can't imagine what it would be like at the height of peak season... There are some nice areas off the main paths though, with pleasant gardens and smaller temples. There is enough to fill the day and it's worth the experience, only costing 120RMB for two people; I would not visit during 'peak peak' times however."
You cannot even begin to express in writing the beauty of the Forbidden City. It's so incredible and full of intricate design and detail elements. Everyone needs to visit if they have the opportunity.
"The Forbidden Palace is arguably the most famous and visited tourist site in Beijing and probably also China. The sheer scale of the complex and its history makes it a delight to visit.

For me this was a lifelong bucket list item and it did not disappoint. When in Beijing this is a site you have to visit."
"The Forbidden City is a must-see if you are in Beijing. We went during late Oct, supposedly off peak but the crowds were still quite large. we were a little late getting there in the morning (arrived 9.45am) and all the Personal Guides were gone and had to get the audio guide instead which was ok but not great. A handy tip, if you are not joining a tour group, try to enter via the Western gate side, there are no crowds here and you can enter straight to ticket booths, bypassing the long lines from the front of the Main entrance."
"Went in October, around 10am and the place was full. Take a hat, and try to arrive early. Huge place to walk around but you definitely hav to go WITH the flow as opposed to waking around it as you wish."
"Spent almost 4 hours and it was worth to be there. Signage were on english thus easy to navigate. Ancient buildings, clean, spacious. Free wifi was available at the whole large section. Drinking water was available at various spots. Buggy service was available for paid users."
"I last went to Forbidden City 27 years ago. I had my second visit last week. The crowd was overwhelming and we couldn't get close to see the exhibits inside the buildings. On 1 Oct 2016, apparently there were 180,000 visitors in Forbidden City itself, and now they limit the number to 80,000 per day.. when we were there, our guide told us the number is only about 50,000 but it still felt overwhelming even though the palace complex is huge."
"This was definitely one of our highlights whilst visiting Beijing. Give yourself at least 2 hours but preferably much longer. it is a cultural highlight. Whilst there are crowds, the place is quite large and is able to cope well with large numbers of people visiting.

The museum is well worth visiting whilst in there and don't forget the actual gardens before you enter the Palace, which are rather quiet and serene. It truly is a photographer's delight, not only travel photojournalists but also for local portrait photographers working with traditionally made-up models."
"Amazed by the sheer scale of the City. We had a very good guide who explained most things to us. Our trip to the City lasted about 2 hours but you could spend all day here. We loved the feeling of history being all around d you. There were some girls who had dressed as concubines which was very interesting. Loved the gardens at the back of the City and the story of the Dragon Lady - the aunt of the Last Emperor who effectively ruled China from behind a silk screen- so fascinating- we loved it here and highly recommend it - only one thing, if you are a woman and need the toilet - be prepared- hole in the ground, absolutely vile stench and no toilet paper (take your own tissues) - really horrible experience!"
"The Forbidden City is Stunning. Itis a large palace complex consisting of numerous halls, building, palaces, and gardens. There are also two museums, The Hall of Clock and Watches and the Treasure Gallery. The entrance to The Forbidden City is on the south side. Just across the street from Tian'anmen Square, and the exit is on the north side. So, I would suggest you go see Tian'anmen Square before you visit the Forbidden City, as it's quite a distance to get back to the south side after you exit from the north. This place opens at 8:30 to about 4:00 or 5:00 depending on the season. However it is closed every Monday. So plan accordingly. Also avoid going on weekend and holidays as it is very busy with local and foreign tourist and organized tours alike. I highly recommend you buy your tickets in advance, as the lines for the on site ticket office can get overwhelming. The good part of advance booking is that you do not have to redeem your tickets at the entrance. Simply use your passport to get in.
When we visited we opted to get the audio guide. I do not recommend this. The guide is supposed to come on automatically when you approach an important building, gate, room or a point of interest etc. However, it does not work accurately. On many occasions nothing would come on or it would come on after we left the site, or the same commentary would be repeated twice over. You must get a personal guide which are available right where you get the audio guide. No need to book an expensive guide from a third party who picks you up from the hotel and then take you to The Forbidden City. Just book your tickets in advance and then hire a human guide from inside the complex."
"We visited in the afternoon, and wished we'd had longer to explore. I loved the clock exhibition, and will certainly return on my next visit to Beijing."
"Pls. Note that I'm writing about just the experience. Will leave the history part to the scholars and historians. Tip: Bring your passport. This will be the only way to get through the long Security check and they will use your passport number as your ticket to get into the museum. Bottom line, if you forget your passport, you will get rudely kicked out by Security.

Took subway from Wangfujing on Red line exit Tiananmen East exit A or B, find the Tiananmen tower and head through main gate. Entrance is through the bridge underneath Mao's face. You can buy tickets from ticket office with grey roof on right side as you enter the palace meridien.

Get a map of the palace. You will start from the south and head toward the north end and if you walk fast, you should be done in three hours.

This place is magical. Royal architecture and intricate stonework. It covers 74 hectares of walking on concrete and at times uneven surface so wear comfortable padded shoes. Lots of tourists and quite a scene. You need a lot of patience to get through the crowd. Major attraction in Beijing."
A must see to get an idea of how the emperors ruled China and what life was like centuries ago. Rich in cultural history and has a few mini museums within the palace grounds.
"If venturing to Forbidden city outside of travel agency arrangements, beware of guys approaching you as tourist guides. They are usually young men, speaking good English, and offering service for 200 plus yuan for 1.5 ir so hours. In fact, they can be fake and not sticking to the time deal. Picture shows my fake guide who tried to rip me off for 200 yuan for""jumping the visitor cue"". If trapped, be firm and request your money back."
"The Forbidden City is a walker's dream (lots of walking). It is a historical site to behold as well. Think of the movie, ""The Last Emperor"" (where presumably some of the scenes were shot in this location). An amazing testament to the history of China and how it has evolved over the years. A must-visit. Early morning visits are better as the crowd grows (to almost unbelievable denseness) as the day wears on."
"We visited Tiananmen Square and the Forbidden City in Beijing on 20th September 2019. Our guide was Rocky Niu, a very knowledgeable man who spoke good English and had a great sense of humour. Our three week holiday in China had been organised by Audley Travel (audleytravel.com) , but I think the local agent they used was Tang Dynasty Travel. Although it was busy we had an interesting and informative tour of the Forbidden City. I suppose you could do your own tour, but having a local guide meant great stories about the history of the Forbidden City and also where the best photo opportunities were to be found."
"Fascinating place, fabulous history, architecture, religion. Its a truly must visit, and best with a private guide not a tour group."
"This palace is a must to visit once a lifetime which showcase the Chinese history of Qing and Ming Dynasty. It is massive with different sections of palaces which one can imagine the supremacy of the emperors and massive ceremony centre for the Chinese government for almost 500 years. Various sections to take note for a good visit include the Meridien Gate, Gate of Supreme Harmony, Hall of Supreme Harmony, Palace of Divine Might, Palace of Heavenly Purity, Palace of Tranquil Longevity, Imperial garden, etc. The architecture is interesting with various symbolism meaning, such as the yellow colour refers to the imperial colour of the emperors, etc. It is also the largest preserved wooden architecture in the world, listed as UNESCO World Heritage. Advance tickets is advisable to avoid Long queue at the entrance counters, which can be purchased using Trip.com Mobile APP and passport details is required for purchase. It is required to bring along password, so that the staff at the entrance will scan the passport based on the online purchase details entered. Hence, it is important to enter the passport details correctly during online purchase. The official website of Forbidden City only allows the local Chinese to make the online purchase will local ID required, luckily we manage to find Trip.com Mobile APP for online purchase as alternative. Nearest metro station is TiananmenEast. Upon reaching the station, it is required to walk another 30-45 minutes to reach the main entrance of the forbidden city. We went in early September on a sunny day and it was still very hot at 34 degree celcius. There were many local Chinese tourists, and was told that it will be even more crowded during cooler weather. Hence, it’s good to start early morning as it may take one full day to visit the entire museum. A bucket list to check when visiting China."
"Best to go with a guide to explain history and significance of buildings and give the details of emperors' duties and ritual of selecting concubines (every three years fresh batches of maidens from Manchu and Mongol families in time of Ching Dynasty). Built in the Ming Dynasty in 1406, the original gold layers of walls had been stripped off so it would have looked much more magnificent at that time. Now the visitor merely gets the vastness of the imperial Palace, the whole panorama is staggering with the number of courts layered one within the other and the Great number of halls each with a specific function. Most interesting of all is the way the Emperor has to be on duty from 5 to 7am,the time told through a sundial, finishes early but has so many functions to fulfil but also to maintain his mystique and power as the son of heaven with a mandate to rule, hence the incense from the many copper vats.
The different Halls are now empty except for a glimpse of the throne in 3 of the Halls but the quarters of the Empress Dowager Tzu Hsi after she gave birth to her son are furnished. Some of the rooms in the Western Palace are used to sell jewelry and souvenirs.

The crowds are stupendous and the security screening and checking of IDs tight but efficient. It's worth visiting for the sense of past power and control in the hands of a privileged few who yet feared for their lives and had to observe the strictest rules of hierarchy. The architecture of the buildings according to fengshui and tradition with important emblems of the dragon, phoenix and lion, symbols of power, is fascinating."
"From a tourist point of view, Beijing is very (too) hot in the summer and cold in the winter so April and October are probably the most favoured months. But there are vast numbers of visitors (tens of thousands per day) but it is the seat of the Ming and Qing dynasties and it is difficult to appreciate their power without visiting the Forbidden City. The architecture is also interesting and there are interesting side exhibitions such as the celadon ceramics from Longquan in the Hall of Abstinence that are worth a visit."
"It was a last minutes arrangement. My cousin & I were gratefull that our hotel managed to engage this Tour Guide - Ricky (+86 185 1879 9077) for a one day tour to cover Tiananmen Square, Forbidden City & Temple of Heaven.
We were worry at first as we were asked to get ready & wait nearby our hotel very early in the morning not knowing that Ricky was there much earlier, waited & greeted us with a smile.
It was a small group of us but already consist of those from Asia, Europe & North America. The day tour was interesting & relax. Ricky always managed to get his group through the entrance without any hassle, lead the group to a side away from the crowd to further explain about the site.
He is not only knowledgeable & entertaining but also sensitive to the tour members need. It happened that, there were members who do not consume certain food due to religion, Ricky has requested the restaurant to re prepare a few other dishes for them.
We felt we were in good hand when my cousin & I did not prepare much for the trip but manage to enjoy through out the tour lead by Ricky."
We went late October and it was just so crowded it took some of the enjoyment away. It is a massive complex and after a while I was a finding seeing another gate a bit monotonous.
"The forbidden city was a massive disappointment- it’s ridiculously busy with so many people everywhere, and because it’s so vast but with no access to any of the internal areas of the buildings it just feels a bit relentless with very little reward. It’s something you feel you have to do but I actually enjoyed looking at it from Jingshan Park more than being in it. From the park you get a much better understanding of how huge it is and the layout (also how many people are in the complex!). Definitely not one of my highlights"
"We went to China, when it was a Chinese holiday! Everywhere was heaving. We did this as part of our tour, and had initially been advised that it would be closed, whilst we were there. However, we had a great tour guide(Carol) who found that it would be open, so we swopped our itinerary around. We had a few hours here, however it was very crowded and hot, and the Chinese do not queue! It's a very impressive wooden structure, overing a huge area,such a shame that you couldn't go inside the rooms, so difficult to see what was inside! Well worth a visit!"
Well worth it. Absolutely huge place. Took tons of pics. Spend hours there lots to see and explore. Have a guide. Lots of crowds.
Take some time and visit the Forbidden city! It will take around 2-4 hours to walk around and explore. This is the a must see! So humbling to see this massive city surrounded by a Emerald green moat and tall brick city walls!
"It is wonderful place but it was very crowded on Tuesday morning, partly because the museum is close on Mondays."
"This palace is steeped in history, and huge to walk through, with lots to see. Very clean and well kept."
We tried to buy tickets to gain entry but as it was the 70 years anniversary of communism and Golden Week the 80000 daily ticket allocation was exceeded. Requests would have to be made 3 days prior to visiting. If you are going from the UK tickets may be obtained by a Chinese sponsor on your behalf though.
"As advised by many travellers if you are on FnE trip, FC tix has to book advance via online. We booked one week advance through China app 大众点评. For 2 of us, we chose the Chinese speaking senior guide + zhenbao guan + zhongbiao guan. Total ¥316.

Online ticket will require your passport details. At every entrance, there will be staff checking your passport. If I remembered correctly, we were checked 4 times.

Also, we witnessed many people walk-in to buy were turn down. **Note - each day only 80K tix are released.

We were early to meet our guide somewhere near Meridian Gate 午门. Our tour start punctually at 9am. We took a map of FC at the tourist office which was on the left. I didn't see any English map. We were given a small device connected to earpiece. The device + earpiece were to listen to guide introduction of FC.

Guided tour start at 9am and end about 12.30hrs. It covered partial of FC, meaning the must must see areas only. Lots of walking, and do not lost your map. It helped you to find exit and finding toilets.

I would advise to bring your own food and drink. Is crowded and expensive. Some toilets for the ladies super long queue.

Like the long walkway of the two high red wall, yanxi court, nine dragons wall, and those other courts or gates, plus my guide's humourous story telling of FC, I find it so interesting and worth it."
"If there is anything I love about China, is its efforts to preserve their rich culture, and for a traveler, it is just fascinating, way better than a Korean novela. Go there early so you can take time to enjoy the huge place, no rush to go from one spot to the other."
The history of the Forbidden city is amazing and you cannot understand how such structures were built so long ago. This place is so huge it takes you for ever to get from start to the finish. It was great having an english speaking guide to tell us all about it.
We visited on a Sunday and the crowds were unbelievable. I used the audio guide but it was useless (and cheap). There was no way to know where to stand to get narration to start so I heard very little. The narration which was given was excellent and interesting but far and few between. Our experience that day was less than optimal due to massive crowds and rainy/cold weather in mid October. Overall it is a top attraction but less enjoyable due to overcrowding. Our hotel concierge helped us get tickets and passport is needed to enter. There were places to get a meal or snack inside the grounds. Our hotel helped arrange taxi to the site but we could not get a taxi back to hotel so had to walk back 40 minutes. There is no taxi stand or place for taxis to stop near the exit. The physical space is huge so lots of walking inside the Forbidden City.
"The experience was very good. The palace is enormous and it is very pretty. I also liked that there were many Chinese people dressed like emperors. If you are in Beijing, you have to visit The Forbidden City. The only bad thing was that it was too crowded."
Good but underwhelming due to the large crowds and little access into the buildings. Highly recommend having a tour guide.
"would have to be one of the must visit places in China, lots of history & architecture. very interesting"
we all hared abaut this place but till you get inside you cant amegine soo nice big its give you so anderstend the power of this place and palac
"I love visiting historical places, especially with a good guide who can tell you so much interesting information. This place had all of that and more for us. I definitely recommend. So many ‘wows’ were spoken throughout the few hours we spent walking around."
"I booked this day trip (staycation) knowing that it was National Day holiday but what I didn't realize was it was the 70th anniversary of modern China. Everything was busier than usual. I had again booked through Chinatours.net. I felt I got great value for my $. Private car, driver and guide picked us up at our hotel. They had arranged knowing I have mobility issues for a wheelchair and someone to push it because our tour was all walking and more walking. The only reason for my 4* rating of this is the issues for someone in a wheelchair to gain access to all the Forbidden City has to offer. Our tour started in Tiananmen Square where there was still highlights from the big 70th party. Then we went under the street to the Forbidden City. I think my pictures reflect the awesomeness of the day."
"Forbidden City is one of the best places to visit in Beijing China! By visiting this place, you will get to learn more about the history of China and how historical the place is! The place is really huge - temples are indeed picturesque! Amazing place! Although it is really crowded and you would notice that most of the visitors are Chinese!

In addition, you can wear a Chinese costume while touring around the area. But if you do not have one, there is a place where you can rent one and take a picture with. It costs 100 RMB though."
"It was the imperial palace of the Qing Dynasty, There are a lot of living houses, and they cover a lot of space, It is real amazing to visit."
Impressive chinese ancient architecture that can be found everywhere around the forbidden city’s area. Be ready for seeing colossal structures and one of the bests historical spots in China!
"One cannot say that they have been to Beijing without visiting either the Great Wall or the Forbidden City!
Some important things to note if this place is on your bucket list:

1) Passport is required to purchase the admission ticket (daily admission quota 80,000 as shared by my guide) -> we reached before 9am and the crowd already numbered in thousands. Cash is accepted for payment here;

2) Bring only necessary items in your backpack as security screening is very thorough (officers will ask you to unzip your bag if the scan reveals that you are carrying thick stacks of papers!);

3) Be thick-skin enough to push through the crowd if you want to get some good pictures of the emperor’s throne which is barricaded."
"You need to bring your passport or Chinese ID to scan and go through the security check.
You can see this place is a great work in the past. You have to spend at least half day here to see and study about its history.
It was an amazing architecture."
A very busy tourist area but it is possible to find quiet area away from the crowds. Recommend going early in the morning to beat the crowds.
"It was very hot when I visited, only issue was that like many attractions in China, some parts charge extra inside.
I did get asked by some Chinese visitors from outside Beijing to take a good natured picture with them.
There are English audio devices to explain it for an additional fee.
I believe if 65 or over it is free."
"This is probably the most crowded attraction in China. The best way to arrive here is to take the subway and exit at Tiananmen East station. Upon exit, be warned that you will have to join the long queue for tight security check. It is mandatory to have your passport, else you will be refused entry. It is recommended that you purchase the entrance ticket online at 3rd party website to avoid queuing. Amazingly, no physical ticket (QR code, ticket reference number etc) is issued. Just show your passport to scan through as the system can detect you have valid ticket. Allocate half a day to visit this huge compound.

After you exit via the north gate Shenwumen 神武门, I recommend you visit the nearby Jingshan Park 景山公园, where you can enjoy a hilltop view of the whole complex."
This is a great place to visit. Involves a lot of walking but some great views. Unfortunately it was raining which took the edge off our experience but it is a must do trip.
"Visited The Forbidden City on a tour of China, what an experience !!! Unbelievable old magnificent buildings, very busy when I went which is the norm. I think the only way to do this visit as with most sightseeing in China is with a local guide."
This was quite a visit with our guide. We could not believe how many people were lined up to enter and then the numbers throughout the visit. Quite a bit of Chinese Emperors history.
"We were on a guided tour and this was a must see.

On entering I was amazed at the sheer numbers visiting, even on a Thursday in October. Everywhere we turned there were more crowds which at times I found unpleasant. However, it was worth enduring them to see the various parts of this very extensive complex. Numerous structures and when you think you've seen then all, you pass through a gateway and see even more."
"They say you can’t visit Beijing without going to the forbidden city but honestly it was the least interesting time we spent in Beijing. The place hasn’t kept it’s old and majestic atmosphere that I, for one, was expecting. It seems very touristy and almost kinda fake. In my opinion you wouldn’t be missing anything here by not going."
"As per other reviews- you need to allocate at least 3 hrs because it is huge. I believe that a tour guide is a must. The guide provides the history, background, insights and color of the Forbidden City that I know is not available on the self-tour machines. Without a guide you're just looking at buildings that have a limited number of informational signs. This place can be very crowded and as you leave the open plaza the entrances to many of the buildings are choke-points for the crowds. Beautiful place full of history. Get a guide and take the time to enjoy."
"Be ready to walk a lot. Its better to go in early spring or autumn. If you go early in the morning you may avoid the crowd. The history is amazing especially if you have a friend or a guide who can explain you everything. We also went to one small park called Jingshan gongyuan, it has unbelievable view to forbidden city and Beijing itself. There is a small Buddha temple on the peak of the park, don't miss it."
"Was amazing, make sure you have the your picture taken dressed in clothing.. 100 yuan, you can thank me later."
"It is big....really big. Courtyard after courtyard starting with offices, concubine accommodation, emperor's children's accommodation, family accommodation and all the required gardens and courtyards that go with that.....it's good to be the emperor!
Lots of history but interesting to note that like other Asian countries capitals did move around."
"According to another person with us, we walked 13 kms this day! The place is extensive & there is so much history within the vast expanse of building & grounds to explore."
"Of the many royal palaces around the world, this truly one stands out. The architecture, colorful buildings, thrones, massive structures, and overall setting is utterly breathtaking. The grounds are expansive with seemingly never ending buildings and courtyards. The extra ticket for the treasury was worth it. The clock museum has mostly European clocks that are beautiful, but could be skipped if you're mostly interested in Chinese culture and art. Unlike most palaces, you do not enter the residential quarters. This site is interesting for the architecture and overall grandeur.
The crowds are the only negative part of the experience - they can be almost oppressive. Ordering tickets online worked great, upload a scan of your passport when ordering, and you simply show your passport at the entrance turnstile, and your're in - totally paperless."
"After walking through Tiananmen Square our group proceeded to the Forbidden City. Our guide explained the history and purpose of the many many structures within the area. Very interesting and the movie, “The Last Emperor,” was filmed on location. Wish I would have watched it again before our trip to China."
First of all I would recommend doing the forbidden city with a guide as there is so much history and information which really adds to the experience. The city is a very large area with so much to take in so you need to take your time to absorb it all. The only down side is it is extremely crowded so be aware of pickpockets and of course you are in China so expect a bit of pushing etc.Also make sure you have plenty of water with you as it can get quite hot with the crowds there. I thoroughly enjoyed my tour of this wonderful bit of Chinese history
We love the ancient architecture of huge place like Forbidden City. We are taking many pictures here....
"When you think about how massive this place is, how long it has survived and how well preserved it is, it is stunning! So much history to take in. Absolutely breath taking"
The forbidden city was very eye catching and built with tiers of history within. The building's architecture is remarkable and inviting to the curious history book worm.
Went here during Golden Week and as expected this was quite busy. As has been previously stated Credit cards are not used much in China they have alipay which requires a Chinese bank account so you will need cash.
"My first visit to the place was in August 1993 when China was still opening up and developing very fast. Back then we had to apply for special visas and get approved government appointed tour guides. One very unique feature back then was that all foreigners have to change their currencies into Foreign Exchange Certificate at government $ exchanges and to change them back when we leave the country because foreigners were not allowed to hold RMB. The forbidden city was a bit rundown then, the crowd was not that bad but the heat was quite unbearable as it was summer. The whole palace has little greenery as the foundation was blocks of stones to prevent assassins tunneling into the place ( that was what the government guide told us ).

Fast forward to November 2018...even though the place looks better thanks to the recent restoration, I noticed what modernization had taken a big toll on all the marble relics. Seems like acid rain has corroded a lot of the detailed carvings.This place is still a must see for visitors doing a China Tour as it is the world's largest surviving palace complex. I am very happy to revisit the place and witness the big change.
My opinion is to visit during the cooler months because the heat from the ground can really get to your nerves during the summer (with the large unruly crowd with no sense of personal space making things worst)."
"Wow. We were in Beijing during golden week 1st to 7th October.
Take a tour as there are 30,000 tickets sold a day and if you are an international, it's difficult to buy online if you don't have Chinese payment system. Bring cash to Beijing, it's not as credit card based as you think. Hotels take major credit cards.
If you visit during golden week it's insane. The Chinese certainly love their leader."
"Great to visit and it was nice to learn about Chinas history. But it was seriously overcrowded, and the summer heat didnt help the situation one bit! If you plan to go, I would propose weekdays in the morning."
We spent a few hours in the forbidden city. We have been there on a previous trip to China as well. It is impressive in every way. Worth just taking your time and wandering around each part of it. It is a very memorable experience.
"Adjacent to Tienanmen Square, the Forbidden City is massive - you can't go inside most of the buildings, but being able to stroll through hundreds of years of Chinese history is amazing."
"Because when in China the Forbidden City represents a gathering place for all. Not only are there visitors from all over the world, many Chinese people from all over the country come to visit this historic and beautiful site. Take a tour and have your guide explain all the history."
Get ready to walk and walk. The part that struck me was the size of the court yards and the palaces were made to impress the commoners. Recommend you buys tickets in advance. Some sections require additional tickets. Loved the garden and art museum (note the propaganda).
"I thought Forbidden city would be an hour or two affair but I had a surprise in store . You need at least four to five hours to get a grip of the place and if you are a history buff even a full day is not enough . Very pretty and well maintained with a history . Here a few pointers which might help foreigners:
1. Take your passport
2. Buy ticket (printout) in advance
3. Reach half and hour before opening
4. Take a tour guide - recorded or person
5. Once you enter exit is on the other end and the area is spread over 180 acres .
6. Hopefully your legs are in good walking condition.
7. Take water and umbrella."
"Imagining life within this fortress could keep you entertained all day! Worth the visit, take extra time if you can to just look at the details on every surface. Absolutely get a guide to explain the history of this location - it is worth the fee."
Wow. This place is massive. Spectacular. Well worth the walks. Loved the location activated tour guide device and photo opportunities. Dress up warm in winter - I’m not sure how the Emperor was able to maintain warmth I. The cold halls. Wrap up in coats and gloves.
"This attraction is well worth visiting and exploring, however it is essential that you have a guide or rent one of their digital guides.2-3 hours should be allowed to explore the various parts."
"A great visit to summer palace. Superbly clean, huge area as it was evening we didn't go into the palace. Entry was easy buying tickets. It was windy so boat services were suspended. We walked around and crossed the bridge to go into a Temple."
"For us this was the best sight in Beijing, personal preference.
It was huge and the history was amazing.
Totally loved it."
"I can't wait to go back with my sons and have them experience this amazing place, learn about the Chinese culture and live this wonderful experience."
"This is a huge area and unfortunately it all look the same. But the area is fascinating and has a ton of history.
You will need 1/2 a day for sure. but do not try to see it all, you will not be able to I think. We saw all the buildings on the left side and had to give up. that was after 5 hours. And in the heat it is pretty exhausting."
"This is a huge site,since 1987 it is a UNESCO world heritagesite.
Two days here and not enough time to take it all in.
Suggest you get a route plan as it is endlass."
"We were lucky that closure of the Forbidden City (as part of the 70th anniversary celebrations) was a few days are for our visit.
This is a must see attraction helping the visitor understanding the history of this vast country.
I would suggest being part of a guided tour as give you a better understanding of the impact of the Emperors. It will also help you gain access which has stringent rules ; make sure you take your passport as you may not get in. Also be prepared for a very close security search as you enter.
The place is huge with plenty to see so give yourself a couple of hours. I would recommend keeping to the left or right rather than walk down the centre as you will find fewer visitors allowing you more time to enjoy.
Take water as shade is at a premium as you walk from section to section.
A must see"
"Beautiful place- plan for at least a full morning to explore. If it’s hot, remember to bring water & maybe a snack. Very populated- can bring pollution masks if you want. Although there are many people, it didn’t seem very crowded. Able to freely move around, even with a tour!"
"Unfortunately, the day we visited the Forbidden City the temperature was 98 degrees with a humidity of 80%. There was virtualy no shade except fpr along one of the walls. Otherwise, the FC is a must visit since its history is encapsulates so mush of China's hostory of a few dynasties. Do nit miss."
We didn't think we could get to see this as we were informed just before departure on the tour that a it would be closed due to preparations for the 70th anniversary celebrations but during the trip we found it was closing the day after our arrival in Beijing so we managed 90 minutes there. I would have loved to have seen more of it as it is incredible but I guess90 mins is better than nothing!
"Forbidden City is on of the most known sights in Beijing and is part of a huge complex which include Forbidden City itself and Tiananmen Square. The square is mostly known by a huge picture of former chinese leader Mao Zedong, the Maos legacy is one of the reasons for very tight security (personal checks, metal detector, X-ray) around square itself.
The entrance fee is around 200 yuan and the reservations have to be made in advance (if you stay in one of the high end hotels they will make reservations for you) and the ticket is your passport.
That is one of the must see places in China which will take whole day to see it all. Only by the visiting the Forbidden City you will get the feeling how majestic Ming dynasty really was. 😊"
On of the must see places while in Beijing. Rocky took us on a most informative journey through the Forbidden City and would certainly recommend him as ones guide.
"It was very crowded in the middle section. The ones at the west side were more interesting while on the east were quite empty.

You could overser Jinshan opposite the forbidden city when you exit.

There were a few security checks and suggest to purchase entrance tickets in advance as they sold out easily with daily quota set. Its quite a long walk from the nearest train station.

On the way you will see Tianmen Square. Its suggested to enter the forbidden city before 12pm. So keep your Tianmen Square visit shorter. If you have more time you can then venture to Jinshan when you exit the forbidden city.

Grab roast duck for dinner thereafter at China, Beijing, Dongcheng, 北翔凤胡同11号, Liqun roast duck restaurant. Worth it and long queue after 6pm. Go early!

Oh yes, while inside the forbidden city you may rent the self guided tour tools and bring some snacks and water. Stay hydrated!

Try going in different season for different experience."
The Forbidden City tour was interesting and full of history. Our group was there for about two hours but I think it was a bit long. I encourage everyone to visit.
Take a boat on the lake and then a gentle stroll. No rush and just enjoy. History at its best. Can be crowded.
"No visit to Beijing would be complete without a visit to the Forbidden City and Tienanmen Square. Long lines but with tour guide can bypass and get in more quickly. But expect large crowds. Interesting to learn how the emperors lived and how the rooms were utilized. The entire area full of rich history and current changes started by Mao, whose tomb is in the area."
"We utilized the guided service from the MUBUS company. Our Guide, Gustavo, was awesome. He saved us lot of time in queues.
Anyway, you must order tickets online in advance or utilize a guided tour service (I will recommend second option, as the place is crowded and you will miss many spots if you don't have an expert with you.
Anything to say. The place is huge and impressive. Some buildings are in good shape others, need a refurbishment and others are being refurbished."
A highlight visiting this place and the beautiful imperial gardens. When we first arrived it was so busy but as we moved through the different areas the crowds dispersed and it was easy to get around and sit quietly and reflect on the history of the palace.
"Was disappointed the colonnade was in such a tatty condition. Bit were falling off and loose, and the paint peeling and faded.
Ground were wonderful though, and as busy as ever."
"When we went it was raining. 88,000 people clocked in that day as well, so we got to see a whole lot of umbrellas. When we return to China we would like to see the forbidden city the right way."
"The Forbidden City: The largest imperial palace in the world, was once forbidden to ordinary people. Now this magnificent attraction site is open for all(of course with entry fee).You will need 2-3 hours to see this place with imperial living & governing quarters, valuable artworks & traditional gardens. After entering the palace through the “gate of heavenly purity” you will go through the “palace of heavenly purity”, “palace of union & peace”, ”hall of terrestrial tranquility” & lastly the “imperial garden”. Looking at the magnitude & unique architectural design of this ancient wooden structure, bright yellow & red imperial colors you will be spell-bound & dumb-astounding! It’s a must-see attraction site in Beijing. Entrance is open at 8.30AM, try to enter early to avoid crowd."
I have been here many times and always bring my friends and business colleagues. This along with Tiananmen Square which is just across the street are a must.
"This is a must for any visit to Beijing, but even getting here early in the morning meant being greeted by hordes of tourists. We visited on a Tuesday and it was heaving. Beautiful scenery but a ruined atmosphere. We would recommend asking your hotel to book tickets in advance so that you can avoid the queues and use the side entrance, rather than the main entrance on Tianmen square, which is very busy. The imperial gardens at the end were beautiful."
"Big and definitely worth a visit. I booked the ticket in advance so getting in was no problem and not much of a queue. I arrived with metro to tianamen east and realised there was a bit of walking just to find the right entrance, so be on time if you have a guided tour. I would recommend a guided tour as the place is so big, I didn’t but I had the audio guide which was ok but didn’t said much more than signes at sights usually does. I recommend to visit the Jingshan Park as well to se the viewing point from which the whole of the Forbidden City is seen."
"We were looking forward to this visit. (Make sure you have your
have your passport with you to go through the security check) The first sections are impressive and there is lots to see and hear about. As you continue the never ending buildings and courtyards develop a bit of sameness about them. You exit at the other end from the entry. Allow at least an hour to walk through at a reasonable pace without taking too many walks through side buildings. Worth seeing however not as ornate or as impressive as I was expecting."
"I finally managed to visit the Forbidden City in my last visit to Beijing. Even that, it was in the nick of time as it was closed at 4 pm. In fact, as of today, the city will be closed from Sep. 21 to Oct. 1, 2019 with the impending national day.

This is a place that should not be missed. The Forbidden City aka the Palace Museum or Gu Gong in Chinese, once served as the imperial palace for 24 emperors.

Please bring your passport with you as the security will ask for it.

English service is apparently not ready on the official booking website, so foreigners need to buy tickets through travel agencies or Chinese friends. However, by chance we found out that a ticket window is opened near the Meridian Gate for special needs and you may get a ticket from there.

The palace took 14 years to be completed in 1420 involving 1 million workers. You would be at awe as you enter the palace area.

It has more than 90 palace quarters and courtyards, 980 buildings and over 8,728 rooms.

This place definitely cannot be completed in 2 or 3 hours.

The bricks were apparently made from white lime and glutinous rice while the cement is made from glutinous rice and egg whites.

You will see a lot of yellow in the building as that is the symbol of the royal family. Save for the roof of the royal library, as black represented water then and could extinguish fire.

If you have time, I would suggest you go to this place early in the morning and twice. There are just too many things to see and appreciate.

I was glad that I made it this time and will visit again."
Be aware this site and most central Beijing tourist destinations will be closed for a massive parade and associate rehearsals and preparations. Access to some hotels may even be blocked. As I walked around last night road closures were starting. Check with your hotel for more information.
"The Forbidden City is amazing and a must destination on a visit to Beijing. We were treated to a walking tour and I thoroughly recommend a guide as it brings the history alive.

Don’t forget your passport."
"This must be one of the most impressive places I've ever been. And so massive too! When I went (on a Tuesday in September) the central axis and paid for exhibit halls were a bit too busy, but the rest was not too bad. I got an afternoon ticket and that didn't give enough time to do everything, even though I was there over 4 hours."
A marvellous piece of architecture and opulence. A China so different under an Emperor compared to being under Mao or in the current climate. A guide will help while viewing.
"We booked tickets on line before leaving the UK. Take your passport as you can’t get in without it. We actually took our passports around in Beijing and were asked for ID in a few places. You need to go through security to get in and most people didn’t like to form a queue so hold your own. The palace itself is huge, you could easily spend half a day here. We did not see all of the exhibitions but did walk around all of the temples, rooms and outdoor artefacts. It’s amazing to think all of this was build thousands of years ago. I’m not sure why the emperor of the time needed such a big property, but it is spectacular. There are water sellers just as you enter but then nothing, so take some with you."
"A magnificent museum. The outer court is spectacular and I could easily imagined how the emperor, his family and courtiers conduct their lives and responsibilities in the many palaces. The towering scarlet walls are also iconic amongst many visitors who watched Chinese imperial dramas. The museum will also be more relevant to visitors who already have a basic understanding of life in the forbidden city. Expect to walk for around 4-5 hours. Bring your own food as I only find 1 restaurant in the museum."
"Loved , loved exploring this place, the history that goes behind it is amazing!! The grounds are massive so defiantly. E sure to leave at least half a day to go round.There are many different temples to visit and there are many different sections which keeps it interesting.My best advice is to buy an audio tour at the hut, there are a few around, as you learn so much and for me it made it far more interesting.Theyvare pretty cheap to.
One main tip I can give anyone, don’t go on a weekend at beginning of September.The queues were massive and you weren’t even sure if you were queuing in the right place it’s not very clear and there were thousands of people inside it got a bit suffocating at times.Just find a quieter spot and take refuge then head out again.I would defiantly recommend this place though was brilliant and although was very crowded still really enjoyed it."
"What an amazing place. We had a tour guide (via MuBus) and he was excellent. Explained the history and intricacies of the architecture very well. Once again, there were A LOT of people. We went in the morning and heard there are less people in the afternoon."
Spent four hours in the Forbidden City. Very hot so ensure plenty of water and sunscreen. Some shade available but limited and was very busy so hard to get a spot. Buildings and history was just incredible.
"My visit to Beijing left me so breathless ... we visit the Palace the very day we arrive without even checking in to the hotel yet! (Super tiring though ... lol)
There were security check even before you can see the Gates which impress me a lot about the way things were done in Beijing. Tiananmen Gate already set my heart racing, finally I am looking at the red wall in real, with Mao's photo there as always seen in TV! SO Grand!
We proceed to follow the crowd and enter into the city. Buying of tickets is now so effiicient, locals were made to buy their tickets with phone, and they do so by scanning the barcode labels at the tentages set up around the vast space before the entrance. We struggled for a while before we realise for tourist there is a counter at your right hand corner when facing the palace. That is strictly for tourist only. Entering the city is by passport scanning, so do bring along your passport.
The visit to his grand palace is simple awesome, you just go ""wow"" then ""wow"" again and again! So many things to see, historical values to beautiful architecture. You can only see the throne/chair of the Emperor from far though, can't enter the main hall.
I can't describe how beautiful and worth visiting the place is, I can only encourage you to ""must visit""!
Do wear very comfortable walking shoes, bring water(lot) and snacks as it is going to be a long walk! Food and water are sold inside otherwise, price is actually quite reasonable compared to those ridiculous ones what charge 20-30rmb just outside the gate(convenient stores charge 3-6rmb).
We spent something like 4hours or more in the hot summer sun and yet fully love the place!
Best Palace I have seen in all the different countries!"
"We took a semi-private guided tour to this place.
This place is really neat even a 23 /21 year old couple with 56/52 parents couple.
We enjoy this trip as well as the history/ culture lessons.
Take a guided tour so u can skip the line, as well as the English speaking history lesson. The young couple really appreciated the lessons.
Thanks to Viator Tour Kevin in Beijing China 🇨🇳."
"we visited the forbidden city on a private tour with odynovo. our tour guide jack was excellent. the forbidden city is a must to see. after seeing on the movies, and documentaries. we were amazed at the size of it. the line up was very long, and you could get lost inside without a guide. I recommend a private tour to get you around and, learn the history"
"I visited the Forbidden City and was amazed at the beauty and how the Chinese have been able to preserve the integrity of these ancient pieces of artwork, sculpture and even the fabrics in the main building. The city is huge, so you will be doing a lot of walking. Please bring comfortable shoes for walking. This is a must do tour!"
"The history of the site is amazing, make sure you understand the story before you visit.

As you enter you will be amazed at how big this place is and what luxury the Emperor must have enjoyed.

I would suggest a tour guide who will be able to tell you what each building is. There are apparently 900 rooms.

What I found disappointing is that you can’t see the rooms internally. Obviously a lot was lost during the cultural revolution."
"Quite chaotic queuing to get into the main part but worth it. No matter what you read, until you see the Forbidden City, you don't realise how huge the whole place is. We could only see a very small portion as part of a TripADeal tour but what we did see was very impressive.
Beautiful temples, carvings and the Concubine's gardens and home were wonderful. I asked how long it would take to see the whole Forbidden City and the tour guide told me 3 full days!!"
"One of the premier sites in China, totally unmissable. Try to organise tickets in advance, as the queues are long, numbers limited and often sold out. The official website did not allow us to book as we did not have Chinese phone number or payment but we booked online with TravelChinaGuide dot com which worked fine and we avoided the queues and just had to show passports to get in.

This is a very big place to visit and there are big crowds outside the gate. We were approached by various fixers offering tickets at vastly inflated prices and unofficial guide services. It was very hot in August so be prepared with suncream, water and snacks, and maybe even a sun umbrella.

We decided to hire one of the official guides and were assigned an English speaking guide, 2 hours for Y500. She was knowledgeable and helped us to understand and appreciate the history and significance of the buildings and layout. They do offer self guided headsets but we thought to make the most of the visit, we would be better with a real person.

I won’t go into detail about the Forbidden City, only to say the scale of the place, the buildings and gardens are very impressive. To think of the power that the emperors exercised to build and maintain such a place is amazing. And to think that eventually for the last emperor, it became forbidden in a completely different way - forbidden for him to leave, rather than forbidden for others to enter.

The museum has many interesting exhibits, though many of the buildings are not open to visitors. You can spend many hours here and not see it all, but it really is an unmissable place to visit. Take your time to explore, sit down and take breaks, pace yourself and you will enjoy more. You can’t say you have seen China unless you have been to the Forbidden City."
"We are travelling with Nexus holidays and opted for the tour with them. Waste of money, others in the tour went their own way and did a self guided tour - which cost 1/3 of the price better option. The city is amazing and you can not miss it during a trip here."
"Should you visit? Of course, but be prepared for massive crowds of mostly Chinese nationals and employ a guide."
"This is a must see highlight but do arrange a tour guide and do arrange early as visitor numbers are limited. Tickets need to bought in advance if there is a weekend of holiday period involved. Well worth facing the crowds, which are the norm in this country."
"This is the main attraction you should go when in Beijing! it is not easy to go alone, would reccomend to get a guide to show you around as it is huge! Would leave around 4-5hs to visit there"
You need to be fairly fit it is a long walk. On the day we visited my Pacer app said I had walked 19 miles! I have to say I was not bored for one minute. Perfect weather sunny day in February for this visit. Each part of the inner city as you progress seems more spectacular. They want you to buy a ticket using a WeChat account which you cannot do unless you are a resident of PRC and it is linked to your bank account. There is a small ticket booth on the right of the large open area before the pay entrance. Show your passport if you are over 60 because it is free!
"It was really hot the day we arrived so most likely didn’t do it justice, but what we saw was really enjoyable, buy the tickets in advance and bring your passport and plenty of liquids.
Definitely get the audio guide, think it was 40yuan . Another must do when in Beijing"
"The sheer scale of the Forbidden City is awe-inspiring. When you add the architecture, the gardens and the history, you have a guaranteed day of wonder for any traveler."
"This is a must see.
Hard to believe the history the dynasties and the true splendid of this masterpiece of history.
Walking from one end entrance gate to the end exit gate does take 2-3 hours.
So much to see. We were on a tour so we had insight about the different emperors and the significance of the buildings.
Hard to believe the whole place housed one emperor and many many underlings.
Hard to believe the whole place was build from wood and remains a true wonder of the world."
"A must visit place of Beijing. It is a palace of vast beauty, especially if you like Chinese culture and their ancient architecture. The place was large and most of it is not sheltered. However, there are many souvenir shops located around the palace, so you can go in for some cool air and of course to look for nice looking souvenirs.

One disappointing thing is that most of the buildings does not allow entry so you can only look in from the outside. But it is understandable as they wanted to preserve the furnitures and decorations better.

Recommended duration of visit is about 2-3 hours."
"Wow and I don’t often say that. This is a massive old city with so many interesting buildings. We had a guide who explained the history and why and who occupied the different structures. The buildings themselves are so interesting but the history is fascinating, especially about his concubines and their families way of life."
"This is an amazing palace complex. So many different buildings. I’m not sure how accurate the stories are that our guide told us, but it is an amazing tourist attraction and likely one of the two most visited in China. The other being The Great Wall of China."
This palace is an amazing place to visit and definitely not to be missed when visiting Beijing. Upon entering the main gate I was surprised by its enormity and beauty. Lots to see especially for those interested in the history of China and its emperors.
"We visited Tiananmen square first and walked to the Forbidden City, originally there were part of a whole. 80,000 tickets sold per day was what we were told, and half of them were there with us. But it's so big that most of the time we weren't crowded. Almost all the items from the palace are gone, in a museum in Taipei we were told. But just absorbing the size of the spaces is incredible. Like many places I wonder if it's better to visit later in the day when more local tourists leave."
Everyone interested in Sinology must visit this place. Can be a little underwhelming as most of the indoor rooms are closed to the public so you will find yourself walking around for hours in hot courtyard.
"If your going to come here get in early this place gets cert crowded with tourists and annoying tour guides who push through with their groups.

There is headphones for people if they want to listen electronically to history. There are some places that sell water.

Alot of history and alot of walking"
"After 2 x half day visits, I still haven't seen it all. Be prepared as there are a LOT of visitors and on one of my visits, the entire central area was blocked off for a dignitary who was visiting. The side gardens and stories of the concubines were very interesting and I'd love to spend more time exploring. Even with many other visitors, there are opportunities for great photos - both the gardens and the architecture of the buildings will draw your eye."
"If you really tell someone in the western world that you are not worthy of visiting the forbidden city and you will not be described as crazy .....
crowds to the point of being agorophobic, any exhibit worthy of the visitor's attention. you only see beautiful walled buildings and Chinese everywhere."
Visited the Forbidden City on the last Sunday of summer holiday. We got there early and the crowds were manageable. To get there there is an entrance on the right hand side of the Mao portrait (you will see lots of people go in). There is no signs in English but you have to keep walking through a garden and you will get to the entrance. We bought tickets online before hand through a third party. I would recommend this as there are only limited amount of tickets per day. The place is huge and we spend around an hour and a half. Do not forget to also check out the side alleys.
"We came here late July 2019. The weather was extremely hot. It was so crowded. There were times when the crowd and hot weather almost made me passed out. I recommend a small backpack with water bottles and definitely a hat. This place is huge. Plan on lots of walking and have patience with the crowd. Some could be pushy and rude. But overall, it’s a good experience and a place you should at least stop by to see."
"All 80000 tickets sold out day after day at the museum ticket booth. My foreign issued credit card didn't work on the palace museum website so I had to book through trip-advisor's tour guides. This was the only way we got tickets. Bring your passport wherever you go in Beijing because they will scan it with your tickets. The museum has audio guides at the entrance for small rental fee I forget if it was $30 or $40rmb and maps are available for purchase at $10rmb from the many souvenir stores. If you rent the audio guide, it has a general map printed on it and it's worth the price. It automatically plays based on your gps location. We spent all day from opening to closing but couldn't see it all. Very crowded and minimal seats available with few stores that sold food and drinks but it is a palace. Bring some snacks food and water for your hike and you will be ready for your 7hour walk. Many buildings converted to souvenir stores and museum displays with air conditioning which made our trip bearable but if visiting in the summer bring a portable fan and umbrellas to shield you from the heat because a walk from building to building was in the scorching sun with other 79990+ travelers. Overly crowded with continuous hoards of people pushing to get a one second glimpse of the emperor's throne but to be walking inside palace grounds for an entire day which was originally closed to all public except for royalty and staff is an amazing feeling which you can not replicate. Many staff and security working hard to keep site clean and plenty of clean bathrooms available onsite and in vicinity on our way to the museum. It is accessible by train which brings you two blocks to the entrance-very convenient but be prepared for the crowds."
"Since we couldn't buy our tickets online we showed at the opening. Make sure to bring your passport as they don't issue tickets but just add your passport number to their computer. We didn't have to wait more than 5 mins to get tickets and another 5 mins to get inside. However, as we were inside there were just tons of people constantly pouring it, so the later you come, the longer the lines get. Although there are a lot of people, since its open it doesn't feel too bad. There are audio guides in all languages to help you explore the grounds. We spent two hours and only saw a portion of the sites. Make sure to bring some good shoes and your patience but definitely worth the trip."
"Duration: 3-4 hours

Definitely a must see sight in Beijing. We went end August 2019 and the weather was just right. Best to arrive at 830am when the Palace opens to be ahead of the horde of tourists visiting daily. Advisable to look for a good tourist guide to take you around the palace and help navigate the different spots."
Be prepared for a big place and a lot of people. There are LOT of people everywhere consequently I think weekends should be avoided at all costs. Prepare for which parts are must see for you BEFORE you get there.
"We had read that, as a Swede, you could visit with your driver’s license, but that was NOT the case! Bring your passport, or they won’t let you in!"
Such a great view to visit on a snowy day. My friend said it's also the first time for her to see the snow in the forbidden city. Amanzing!
"Great experience to visit such an important place in China’s history. It is big, multiple sections /areas to visit, there are hundreds of people if not thousands at the same time. My recommendations: buy your tickets in advance, go early, plan your visit and select areas that you want to explore, take some breaks in the shadow, and do not forget to visit the Park across the exit street for amazing views"
"The queues to get through security were so unorganised and rammed. It took us at least half an hour to get through the gates just to walk over to the forbidden city entrance.
Once inside it's fine. The views are incredible and I'd highly recommend pre downloading an audio guide, or purchasing one when you're there, there's a lot to see!
Pre purchase tickets is a must (hostels and hotels will help with that).
Take your own food and drinks."
"We had two runs at the FP, 1 failed, the other successful.

On a Tuesday we went early. We were at the Tiananmen Square security check before 08.00. And it was 80°F in the shade.

It took us until after 09.00 to get the remaining 2 km to the ticket office!! And they were sold out for the day.

For our next attempt, on Thursday, we pre-booked. We also, having learnt from the way we left on Tuesday, entered by taking metro to nearest station to the east, walking up to the east gate, following the Moat around its SE leg and ending up at the ticket office and Meridean gate. No Tiananmen Square security or crowds, just a pleasant walk. And tickets were available had we needed them.

Once inside we spent the day there. It was such a shame to see 90% ? of the visitors just heading up the central axis. Get away from the centre to the eastern or western parts of the complex and it is all so much more calm and peaceful.

There are plenty of places to get drinks, ices, snacks, and lots of seating areas, but MOST are off the central axis. Several of the Gates had seating too, in the shade and with a breeze.

Mostly well signposted with adequate descriptions on boards outside all the key buildings.

So, why only three?
1 Just getting in, for most people, is a serious pain. Follow our tip above - DO NOT GO IN VIA THE CHAIRMAN MAO ENTRANCE, GO IN FROM THE EAST.

2 It is vast, and so somewhat repetitive. I challenge anyone to know which hall is which when they look at their photos back home

3 Viewing the inside of the Halls is a very poor visitor experience. Firstly getting to the narrow area just outside the door, the only place from which you are allowed to view the inside of all the Halls, requires a serious elbow shove and wrestle to get to the front. Because if you don't you can be sure the Chinese will - young / old, male/female, they all have the same level of manners - NONE WHATSOEVER!

4 But, once you get to the front, and grip the railing so you don't get pushed out, and peer around the camera phones that are blocking the view ahead of you, you can hardly see inside anyway because the interiors are not lit up. Peering in from full sun outside does not make for a pleasant view.

5 We had a list of 'halls/museums' we wanted to do inside for various key items, but it appeared some were closed, some repurposed. We made it into Furniture, Treasures, and Clocks, all very good, but the last two were full of cabinet hugging, photo taking Chinese.

6 There are so many variations on what each building is called. Confusing.

Of course you're not going to not go. But it may not be your #1 place you visit in Beijing."
Because of it's history everyone should pay a visit. The area was huge and our guide explained everything in great detail otherwise we would never have know all of the fine details
"Unfortunately we arrived just as it was closing at 5.30pm on our short stopover heading back to New Zealand. However a young Chinese girl stopped us and asked if she could practice her English for a while and show us around. We could see no harm. She took us to a restaurant and although we said we had already eaten and repeatedly said we didn't want anything, she ordered teas to share and a meal for herself. We had a beer each. After the meal she said we owed 400 yuan to cover our share (about NZ$90). To not make a fuss we ended up paying, but it was a very expensive beer. Crooks come in all shapes and sizes!"
"our tour guide jack walked us through the forbidden city. it was very crowded, and you have to line up for a while, but it was well worth it. a must see."
"Beautiful but extremely crowded in August, and I assume all the time since it’s a must-see attraction in Beijing. I did not do the self-guided audio tour bc I did not want to follow in line with hoards of tourists. It’s a great place to walk and take in the architecture and appreciate the exquisite detail put into the buildings, but any photos you take are likely to be filled with other people.
It’s also a very sunny place make sure to take sunscreen, hats, umbrellas etc to protect you.
Definitely go, but prepare yourself for sun and people."
"This earlier palatial heart of China is, like everything else in China, BIG. BIG and beautiful and awe inspiring. From the very formal guards at the entrance to the amazing structures and gardens, all is worth the time (at least five to six hours) and effort (long walking distances) there. Be sure to be there early - the queues are long and the security measures make for an even longer wait."
"Definitely on the tourist list to visit, but it was just another temple, in a long line of temples - sorry.."
"This felt like a must see in Beijing but I actually found it quite dull and all the same after a while.
I arrived over an hour and half before opening and wasn’t at the beginning of the queue. Even if I had been people would kill their grandmother to get in front of you here! You can’t deny the impressiveness of the buildings but maybe the crowds and their general rudeness dampened my experience."
Interesting to visit the little temple hill particularly when seeing it from the PuXuan hotel windows.
"Amazing buildings, interesting statues and packed full of history. The 80000 other tourists visiting at the same time was also quite an experience! Each hall is followed by another and they do all blend into one after a while. They include the hall of mental cultivation, palace of eternal longevity, palace of earthly honour, palace of gathered elegance, palace of universal happiness, palace of eternal spring and the hall of the supreme principle. They were amazing to see, but somehow lacked cultural context. The imperial garden, however, was spectacular and a pleasant surprise after all the halls and palaces."
"I had been before 17 years ago, but my teenage daughter had not, and so this had to be on our itinerary. I don’t normally like organised tours, and we were supposed to go with a personal guide/car, however we ended up being booked on a Forbidden City tour which also included 2 other places.

Apparently it is very hard to get tickets direct should you wish to go under your own steam.

We arrived at 8:00, and you could see how 80,000 tourists come here every day. Long lines, but out guide seemed to know which one was best to join and we were inside within 10-15 mins.

When I came before it was nowhere near so busy, but the guide took as away from most of the real crowds. It is a fantastic place, and I think I got more out of the visit, because of the guides commentary, than I would have on my own.

Thoroughly recommended, but prepare for crowds and travel light"
it is a great place but believe me It was so many people and we lost all the interest with the number of peopel we have seen
"Forbidden City is one of the historical places in China, where it was the king's palace in the past.
If you want to visit it, I recommend using the tour so that more history can be obtained"
Preserved history beautiful place lotsa people very well worth a day trip... book early and enjoy the fine architectural genius
"It’s a hugely impressive place, and with 80k tickets issued a day, it’s always sold out and the crowds are unbelievable. If you go in summer be prepared to deal with the crowds. Book with a guide as you avoid some of the queues. It’s quite an incredible structure with a fascinating history."
"There isn't a dress code so don't worry, we came in shorts and a t-shirt. No lighters are allowed, so keep them in the hotel room! We were told that we couldn't bring drinks in beforehand but we did anyway, there was no form of checking for that as far as I can remember. There is a lot of walking which you can do at your own pace. It is hot as well. There aren't many points for shade, so if you really can't bear the heat, bring a portable fan which you attach to your phone? Stay hydrated too. If you're feeling brave there is about a 15 minute walk up a hill after you exit the Forbidden City, where you can see the entire city from above, its an easy miss if you don't want to walk. We went just because we had some extra time."
Definitely a must when visit Beijing - its huge so wear flat shoes! Be aware of the fraudsters outside trying to sell tours and crap to you!
"I dont know what I was expecting but we went on a very hot day, queued for an hour in the heat and once we got in we found it initially interesting but after a while it was repetitive, hot and I hate to say it... boring. Sorry,"
"I think if you have any appreciation for Chinese history and culture, then you should go to the Forbidden City once during your trip to Beijing. It might feel like it's not worth it at times, when you're waiting in the ticket line, or the heat is getting to you, or you've had enough of the crowds. Despite that, you won't regret it once you leave. There's so much to see, and it is truly amazing how much history this country has. Seeing the galleries are a must if you do end up going."
"If you pre-purchase your entry tickets online, it helps to avoid the queues, which could be quite long and chaotic, at the ticket purchase counters.

Have your passports ready and search online to purchase the entry tickets online. Enter the date of visit, time slot of your preferred entry, your name and passports' details. Make the payment and get your confirmation of purchase.

On the day of visit, go to the ""Meridian Gate"" (午门) of the Forbidden City. You won't be able to drop off right at the Meridian Gate. The nearest drop off should near the ""East Gate"" (东华门 Dõng huá mén) and then walk to the Meridian Gate.

When at the Meridian Gate, go directly to the entry gates, present your passports and you be allowed in."
"We had Angela our awesome guide and John the best traffic driver EVER!! Beijing traffic is ridiculous.... John maneuvered us all around. The Forbidden City was a great day... Angela was with us for the entire tour, answering the multitude of questions regarding her culture. These two were pleasant and kind toward our special needs. This was the ONLY way to see Beijing efficiently... the tic were purchased and we could enter thru the guide gates.
Highly recommended this group for all your touring needs.
They were with us each day.... even provided airport transportation. A full service company."
"The spacious grounds, well-preserved buildings with their luxuriously appointed chambers made for excellent viewing, and for those familiar with the Last Emperor, a particularly touching cultural pilgrimage. It's best to go during the off-peak months, because it gets really busy during August, and you are forced to move along fast without stopping to appreciate the rich architectural details of the place"
"Book ahead to see the Palace Museum tucked into a huge courtyard of the Forbidden City. In summer, it is packed with Chinese families and ""midtown at rush hour"" (we are New Yorkers) does not begin to describe what it is like. But it's all worthwhile, keep walking, peak around people who are shorter than you. The treasures on display rival those at the Palace Musuem in Taiwan and add a lot of interest to the otherwise off-limits chambers and halls of the Forbidden City. Don't miss the Imperial Clocks collection, magnificent!"
"It was interesting, but over reted! Get there before it opens, or you will be over crowed.Lot of up and down stairs.Not a lot to see, just over crowed and walking."
"One of 80,000 on a hot August weekend - got there early- queues worked very efficiently and whilst there are a number of bottlenecks- there are always places which are not too busy... it was hot and windy... the buildings and layout and explanations fascinating- but difficult to digest in a single visit with little knowledge of Chinese history... with so many of the rooms closed and little to demonstrate how the various buildings would have been furnished- this dimension is missing & the site is more difficult to imagine as a living working centre of a complex powerful nation... nevertheless- a must see - relax into the masses of people and don’t worry about the odd push and barge - it’s all friendly!!"
"The palace and forbidden city itself are spectacular. There are many different palaces with names like the palace for maintaining supremacy. While the palaces were certainly impressive, I found it disappointing that the buildings were virtually all closed to the public. If you pay to get into the treasure gallery (which I think costs 10 yuan), then you can go into some of the buildings, so it's definitely worth going in there. I did not go into the Hall of Clocks despite paying for it because the ticket seller said there would be a one hour wait to get inside. It's also fairly difficult to buy tickets. If you have WeChat Pay and are Chinese, then it's easy to buy tickets directly from the museum.Otherwise, you either have to book a tour or buy tickets in advance from an agency. The first time I tried to go in, I arrived there at 12:15 pm, and I was told that tickets had already been sold out for that day. You can buy a morning or an afternoon ticket. I recommend buying the morning ticket because then you can stay as long as you like and if you are not ready to leave, you can stay in the afternoon session as well. I am giving the palace museum 4 stars because it is spectacular to see, and it is definitely worth going to. I should also mention that it is worth getting an audio guide. Without it, much of the meaning of the buildings is lost. I suppose if you do not want to do that, you can book a tour with a real person. Do go if you are in Beijing."
"Our group we escorted through Tienanmen Square and the Forbidden City palace on our day of arrival in Beijing, after a delayed flight from Australia, a generally ""not happy"" group, still in travel gear.
BUT...the tour through the forbidden city was amazing. Beautiful, ornate terraces and buildings, each with a story. Yes, there are five areas.Each visually the same, but different in theme from the previous. So, if you are in Beijing, it is a must see. Combined with Tienanmen Square, it is a day trip, and crowded."
Very EXPANSIVE palace complex! Be ready to walk a LOT if you want to see the entire complex. And it's hot and crowded in July.
"Very large palace complex, the pavilions keep coming one after the other. Every time with nice inner courts. During our visit it was very busy though."
"Jostling, shoving China at its best. Huge lines everywhere. Not a single photo without someone in front of the exhibit. Worth seeing once but never again"
"The Forbidden City is massive!!! It was over 100 acres. Please go with a guide because you will learn so much about its history and customs. It was really neat. Busy season is July- August so it can be crowded then. But, if you have a good guide you can make it past the long lines and have a really enjoyable experience."
"Who would not go? a few tips for smooth entry: you can reserve online. You MUST have your id on you for any museum in China. Foreign tourists enter via the south gate.
See the central - largest buildings, but then go off to the sides to smaller galleries + leave ample time for the garden in the northern part. If you exit via the north gate, a 5-min climb will get you on the hill overlooking the forbidden city. I spent the whole day + still ran out of time. PS: check if the excellent interactive exhibit (before the MAIN entrance > you cannot go back after entering) is open!"
"In comparison to the women and children's museum, here you are surrounded by hundreds of people. The place is huge, so wear comfortable clothing and walking shoes. Water and snacks are reasonable priced and available, but it is always advisable to carry a water bottle. Of course, the whole city speaks to the grand lives of royalty and the impoerished of the population, and to some extent the hierarchical nature of power and intrigue that is part and parcel of palace life. Know that after a while the buildings all begin to look similar and repetitive. If possible buy a map of the palace so you know where exactly you are. Also remember, to book your tickets in advance as there only a limited number of tickets available on a daily basis. Go early...it is very very crowded. Recommend, but avoid July and August as school's out and everyone is out doing the same thing as you!"
"We tried to visit The forbidden kingdom during our short 24-hour layover. Overall impression..... Disappointed...
Despite it's beautiful structure an amazing history the place itself is surrounded by hordes and hordes of Chinese tourists. there is approximately 80000 people visiting this place daily and it felt like they were all there at once. It was impossible to walk around as you were constantly pushed and shoved by people who are desperate to take photos. It was impossible to actually stop, look or embrace it's history because of the overwhelming impact of other tourists."
"The crowds when we visited really took away from the experience. It was hard to get close to anything long enough to really see it. Most of the buildings were closed so the majority was just walking around.
If you go, get there as early as possible. The security lines and entrances get backed up and packed with people. Buying tickets online ahead of your visit will also save you time, you can go straight to the entrance and just show a passport.
Definitely a must see in Beijing."
"This is a truly fascinating place with incredible history. It's huge. But after a while, everything looks the same, and you can't go into any of the buildings. It was HOT when I was there and I was happy to cut my visit shorted than I expected. Other than the small empirical garden area, it's all stone and buildings..."
"First of all, dont go there during public holidays, just dont.
Go pretty early, the tickets are bought at one place, and the entrance is at another. Then just follow the stream of people thru the different buildings. Do study it beforehand so you know a little of the different buildnings."
SO many places. I recommended taking the audio guide that is LED lit and knows by GPS where you are. You could spend HOURS and DAYS in there listening and reading.
Excellent to see the long history of the palace. I would recommend getting tickets online as they sell out quickly. Spend 2-3 hours. Only issue is the crowds but that’s everywhere in China!
"Great choice of souvenirs, price range great and meaning whatever you're budget you can be sure to bring something back from the forbidden city"
"The Forbidden City is truly amazing. I would recommend a guide (see Xiaowei with GreatWallMyLove). It can be very crowded, but Xiaowei can get you in without the long lines and throngs of tourists. The history is rich and the buildings so fascinating. I wouldn't recommend in summer, though."
Spectacular palace with 100's of years of history. Truely amazing and worth the effort with the crowds.
Linda took into account all of our needs inside the Forbidden City. She knew which way for us to see and hear all about it. We loved the whole experience.
It was great to see the Forbidden City. It was a great place for taking pictures. It was very crowed the day we visited.
"Very interesting specially the clock part of the museum, very well presented, all the surrounding of the Museum is very well preserved, it is one to include in any visit to Beijing"
I have been here 3 times through out 10 or more years. It was really worth while re-visiting because they have opened up new areas of the palace which it was not open for public before. I really love the architectures of the palace and the stories behind each building.
Plan about 6 hours if you want to see all of the buildings. It was very crowded but they did a great job moving people through the process. Tins of history and beautiful architecture.
"Tips for Tianmen square and Forbidden City: buy your tickets 3 days in advance!

We didn’t, tickets were sold out for 2 days so we were lucky to have an extra day in Beijing otherwise there was no possibility to visit the forbidden city!
Maybe if you arrange tickets with a tour, but not individually.
The hotel helped us to buy the tickets since the site is in chinese only.

You can visit the Mausoleum of Mao but bags are not or not allowed, you can store them across the street. They allow nothing,so don’t put your camera in your pocket since they will find it and won’t allow you in. It happenend to us and stood in line for 1,5h for nothing!
Your cellphone with camera is no problem.
They close the line at 11 AM, don’t be late!"
"I didn't realize this place is so huge! Went there during winter on a layover. There are a lot of open spaces and winter is probably not the best time to go. Maybe it's just me :) I wasnt prepared clothingwise and i was freezing. Also, the guards and staff are not the most friendly."
Too many people. Be prepare to hustle your way around. Architecture wise is amazing. But it is not well preserved. Specially the interior and the left over items
"It has some interesting buildings but you can see where they have pulled up the old gardens to allow for more space for tourists- and there A LOT of them! I agreed with a previous comment- come to watch the people rather than the buildings!

We bought our tickets online the day before to ensure entry (as they are limited)- this allowed us entry with just our passports as proof of purchase. As soon as we exited the metro the queues began. First the queue for security, then ticket entry, then audio guides and then the shuffle towards the main buildings. We ended up wondering away from the main buildings to try and enjoy some quieter areas- there aren't any. The umbrellas don't help- both my husband and I were hit around the face by people pushing to move forward and completely oblivious of those around them. The audio guide gave basic information about each place- not a huge amount more than the notice boards so maybe a personal guide would make for a better experience. Several times our audio guide recommended we wonder into certain areas that where also shut (presumably for renovation?).

Having visited many sites around China we didn't think the Palace museum offered anything special or different."
If you come to Beijing you must plan a visit to the Forbidden City and the Great Wall. These both are historical places of importance. Forbidden City could be visited throughout the year but Spring and Autumn are preferable. Dont forget to hire a guide to understand the significance of the place.
"The Palace grounds in the Forbidden City was a great visit to this one out of two locations in Beijing China, the other being the Great Wall. The historical significance for this place is overwhelming and a must-visit location."
"Forbidden City is a museum full of palaces. You can't walk into the palaces one by one but only follow the trail and understand the purposes of each palace by reading the introduction in front of it. It is necessary to hire a guide or rent a voice guide along the way to understand the history of the palace. Or else will be just wasting of time walking in a huge area of buildings. The information and the stories are very interesting if you would like to like to understand more in depth Chinese history.

When i was there, not all the palaces are open to visit as there are some small ones were close probably for maintenance. There are a couple of decent restaurants in the museum. Although the price is a little expensive but its worth to pay the price for a nice meal and a short rest.

Prepare umbrellas or sunscreen to cool you down during summer as it could be very hot and crowded which will make people frustrated easily.

Overall its a must-visit tourist attraction and I learnt a lot along the walkthrough."
Great to visit . Be there during peak by 06h00 if you want to visit the grave of Mao Zedong or as some write Mao tse tung.......other wise you can find a cue of 2000 people by 07h30.....One of the oldest star bucks in beijing makes sure you are caffeinated and not go hungry....
"No need for an expensive tour, book online and it is really cheap. Stay near the forbidden city and follow the crowds. Its pretty much an entire day to take your time and see it all . Expensive tours will miss out so much! Tieneman Square is nearby, so if you have time walk around to the Tieneman Gate and see the flag lowering ceremony. A fabulous place and a life highlight!"
"After a visit to Tienanmen Square we passed through the main entrance to the Forbidden City. What amazed us, other than the incredible size of the structures and land area, as the amazing restorations of all of the buildings. You need at least 4 hours to visit this amazing place."
Go big or stay home in China. Everything is so amazing and well preserved. Very interesting displays and laid out very well for visiting.
"Huge place! Quite a few interesting places with the six palaces.
You can also walk through main entrance which used to be reserved for the emperor/empress."
"Another gotta go to site (along with the Great Wall). It’s a big area so, despite the massive crowds, I didn’t feel like it was unmanageable."
"Visited this place during the peak of summer and in the afternoon. Not the best time but was restricted due to my trip planner. Entered from the South gate and exited from the North. A walk to the main gate (from taxi drop-off point) is advisable. Walk along the moat and willow trees. The courtyards are impressive, however, most of the inner rooms are closed to the public."
"Undoubtedly the worst tourist attraction I've visited in the world. Likened more to a conveyor belt being pushed through at a chook raffle, with nothing to see other than a bunch of old delapidated wooden buildings. Definitely a money grab on all fronts. The audio tour only worked when it felt like it, very hit and miss (don't waste your money on it). There's no exhibitions or history signs unless you refer to your guide book or speak mandarin. Umbrellas (on a clear day) should be banned as we spent the bulk of our time pushing umbrellas out of our face and away from our eyes. Locals felt it was acceptable to push and shove there way through....not sure if that's accepted in their society, in mine is rude and uncivilised. Never been to a tourist attraction where locals are allowed to sleep anywhere they like. After an hour and a half I had enough and left. DEFINITELY WOULDN'T VISIT AGAIN!!!!"
"Massive,filled with history. Suggest you get the player with earphones to get the full experience. You will need your passport if you are not a Chinese National. We went in August and it was extremely hot and very crowded which spoiled it a bit so I would recommend go as early as possible to avoid the crowds. There is very limited shelter from the Sun or if it rains. They checked my passport twice at the entrance then again. We walked the viewing tower at the exit on the east gate this was the highlight for me less crowds and nice breeze, we rented bikes so it was easy for us."
"It was quite a busy, hectic, crowded place since it is summer in China, I understand why there were a lot of people. If it weren't for Klook, it would be harder for me to deal with the tickets because I have to grapple for a long queue in buying the ticket. Good thing it was made possible by the said app."
"Wow this was such a experience, especially if you enjoy history and Chinese architecture. This was on our bucket list and it was realy worth the visit. As a non Chinese visitor I will strongly recomend that you use a private guide for this attraction as he/she will explain the history to you and give you a real in depth view of the Forbidden City."
"Amazing bit of story here! so much to see and do. we went here with a guide and weven the day we spent was not enough. there is too much to see that you may need a week here to get through it all. it is very well kept, lots of security and much better in person."
"Too many tourists and too little description of each section. It is rather beautiful, but the tons of people were too hectic."
"The forbidden city is an amazing place and not to be missed. I would recommend going as early as possible in the day, to beat the heat and the crowds. I also highly recommend a tour guide of some kind, otherwise you will be walking around not knowing what you’re looking at. The forbidden city is huge - give yourself a half day."
"Once you see one of the buildings (from outside, as most of them are closed) you see them all!
Absolutely not worth the huge effort to buy tickets (daily capped and mostly sold on WeChat) and get inside (half an hour walk yo the South Gate). Spare your time on Beijing for something else.
I know it sounds crazy and the Forbidden City is consodered the main Beijing's attraction, but it is a SCAM!
Not to mention the impossibility to take pictures, as there are thousands people literally everywhere."
Whilst it is not easy to get entry to the Forbidden City with so many people wanting to visit and hence long queues - but it is well worth the wait. You really need to set aside a couple of hours at least for the visit as there is so much to see and take in. Fabulous attraction.
"Too much crowded. Similar to other palaces, but bigger and more impressive. Go there early in the morning"
"It is a beautiful place filled with past glory of past dynasties. But not recommended to visit during summers. It’s too hot, too crowded and you don’t get the feel of it."
"We were very excited to visit the Forbidden city as it conjured up visions of mysterious and secretive emperors. In reality there are some impressive elements but mostly it wide open courtyards (with no gardens or vegetation) and crowds of tourists pushing and shoving. In some places the crowds became so large that it was dangerous around the staircases and narrow parts of the palace. Our guide did his best to give us a historical overview but the crowds were unrelenting. Right across China we found they did not limit visitor numbers in any of their sites and this degraded the experience quite a lot.

We didn’t even finish our tour as were also ushered out early due to some visiting politicians having being shown around. Having paid our entrance fees we felt we had the right to finish the tour, but you don’t have these rights in China. We thought our tour operator (uniworld) should’ve rescheduled our visit to allow for the visiting politicians as we stayed in Beijing for 4days."
"Unfortunately, after couple of tries I haven't seen Forbidden City, it stayed forbidden to me :)
Be careful when planning visit to this amazing site. First time I went there on Monday, and as any other museum in the world the palace was closed. Tried couple of more times after that, but tickets were sold out! There were only some online tickets left and due to other plans I haven't visited this place...
Chinese people travel a lot within China, and Forbidden City, as almost all other famous sites in China, is overcrowded, but it is really worth visiting.
So, plan your visit, buy tickets on time and don't go there on Mondays :)"
The history of this place is amazing! To go and see it with your own eyes is even more amazing! Make sure to book your tickets in advance online.
"The Forbidden city was fantastic to see with our guide from BTG. She provided some wonderful history and showed us around finding shady spots to stop and explain amongst the other 70 000 visitors that were on site that day! Yes it is crowded, and a hat or umbrella was needed, but fabulous historic site!"
"This place must be visit if you go to Beijing,
Little bit hard to find the entry ticket but usually have many locals people can help you to get or can go by tour agency"
"I think it's pretty hard to go to Beijing and not see the Forbidden City, the home of the emperor during the spring months of the year. This WILL be packed. There are only 80,000 tickets given out per day and many days that sell out several days beforehand...so get them early. There are many different buildings to see, and the on-site museum is great. Like the other imperial palaces in China, most of the buildings you cannot enter and instead, you have to view from the outside. However, there are a few buildings that you can pay extra to go into. The architecture is stunning. I would recommend getting a guided tour so that you have an expert who can explain just exactly what you are seeing."
"Endless and so vast to make sure that we had enough time to explore every spot in the City. Wow. Apart from the recent history of Tiananmen Square, this still holds its significance."
"We had a private tour guide who knew a lot about Chinese history. It really added to the enjoyment of this site. The Forbidden City is huge so wear comfortable shoes and take lots of water. If you don't have a tour guide, they have self tour headsets available for rent."
"Yes this is a historical site with lots of importance to the Chinese. However, it really seemed like the same building after the same building after the same building and got rather monotonous. It also felt like you were stuffed into a small area with a million people. Getting in was uncomfortable and lengthly. Make sure to have your passport when you arrive for the security checks and tickets in advance because they only allow 80,000 per day."
"This was our first foray into touring Beijing. I knew July would be busy, but I didn’t know it would be this insane. Aware of the amounts of people on China, while most know about it, doesn’t prepare you for experiencing it. It had rained that morning so upon leaving the subway the umbrellas were all out. They prepare for the hoarded of people by barricading everything. And so like cattle we went along with the herd. When we got to the entry gate we were sent to another place to buy our tickets. Nothing is marked at all. In other words, if you don’t speak Chinese, don’t expect anything but work. Turns out passports are registered and they count as your ticket. It helps to know your passport number. Back at the gate where we were turned away to buy tickets the lady keyed in my passport number and was getting ready to send me back to the “ticketing” area when I pointed to her screen she had transposed a number. It took us over one hour to just get into the place.

The historical significant is not lost on me. The place is magnificent in its own way. I think we would have enjoyed it more had the audio guides we paid for had worked. No sense in going back to get another one. In between needing Google Translate for everything and dealing with lines at some point you become tired of “working”. All in all I didn’t see anything that wowed me. I was expecting a lot more from such a renowned place. Oh, the umbrella
Thing is for both rain and shine. Never thought I would have to fight off umbrellas in the sun!

To add to the ambiance is one cultural phenomenon to plague us the rest of the way in most of our trip - Pollution!! I’m not talking about Smog. I’m speaking about noise pollution. Seems everyone was screaming at each other. After a while I realized that’s just how they speak. It didn’t help Chinese tour guides were using megaphones to communicate with their groups. Have they heard of earpieces for each tourist? Probably pervasive to the screaming is the tour guides obnoxiously screaming over each other presenting the
Highlights. It felt as if Kenny from South Park was constantly in my ear screaming with no mercy.

After we were ready to leave, came the Hotel California moment of the trip. Despite following the signs that read in small letters along with many other things, we got back to what was the entry gate where we were stopped. Unable to communicate finally a lady took mercy on our plight to leave and showed us back to where the exit was. We are talking about at least 200 meters from where we were. Would never have found it without her.

My recommendation for travelers to this site is to be well aware of what you’ll find if doing it on your own. Otherwise go with a tour guide to make things a lot easier on you. Oh, and take earplugs. You’ll thank me later! We used some for the remainder of the trip and found peace!"
"Go on a weekday (not Monday as it is closed), and preferably early morning. Otherwise it is way too overcrowded and not really a satisfying experience. Also walk up the hill (Jingshan Park) behind the north exit to get a great view of the whole city."
"The open plazas provide plenty of room, but the entrances to many of the buildings are choke-points for the crowds. There are many wheelchair ramps to get around but some of the buildings are accessible only by climbing the staircases."
"It's a little off the beaten path within the Forbidden City but this museum has many beautiful objects in it Jewelry, crowns, decorative jars and plates. It's not the Crown Jewels of England but as long as you are there and have time, it's worth a look"
"We visited using just the ticket option. The self guided machines you hire probably would be ok to give you a background but they don’t work well so I don’t think we got enough explanation on the site.
As per other reviews- you need to allocate 3 hrs or so because it is huge! Also if you can - get there at opening before all the tour coaches show up. I can’t give enough warning on this!
The actual site is amazing but you can’t see inside any buildings because it is closed up with Perspex that is very grimy. The summer palace is much prettier - but don’t do on the same day!"
"The Forbidden City is a must-see location while in Beijing, but you won't be able to enjoy with the crowds. It is literally pressing getting through. Buy your tickets and get an e-ticket and see it early in the morning before the tour groups get there."
"Our tour group visited the Forbidden City during our time in Beijing. Since this was a bucket list item for me, it was great to have a tour guide who gave us the history of the place and structures. Without that, you're just looking at buildings that have a limited number of interpretative signs."
Just fascinating place rich in history. You get a feel of how the emperors lived long ago. There is a lot of walking involved.
"Although this is a huge place and there is space for everyone there is little to see. Our guide helped by giving us the history and this was far better than the place itself. Huge courtyards with nothing in!
It might have been more interesting if they had recreated some of its past glory."
"Vast place but still crowded at all times with mainly Chinese tourists. Our guide told us that they had sold 80000 tickets for
the day we visited !

Despite the crowds it is still very interesting and worthwhile visiting to see the huge scale of the palace and have a glimpse into how the emperors lived until the 1920s."
"I visited this great place in late June on a Sunday morning.

Advise: Buy your ticket online or otherwise you need to wait under the hot for quite a long time to buy the admission ticket. Please remember to bring your ID or passport as they will have your name linked to the ticket.

Recommend: Spend a few hours especially if you have a guide walking around and learn more on the history."
"You can’t come on a tour of Beijing without seeing the Forbidden City. It’s been nicely restored since we saw it in 1995 but still takes hours to get around. It’s extremely crowded during July but there’s plenty of fast track access for private tours.

Highly recommended while in Beijing."
"We just came from Seoul and Forbidden City was much bigger n more magnificent than any palace in Seoul. Use a tour guide or rent a digital guide or read any book before coming here, will help you enjoy more. It was one of the best places to understand more about China history."
"80 000 people each day during the summer months are coming to this wonder.
No mercy for the ones looking for peaceful day. No way to feel the enchant atmosphere or to foresee where the Emperor was ruling this great country. As a historical and cultural site- this place should be your top priority if in Beijing. But not at this time of the year.
Please use also agency in order to book tickets in advance.
Other then that the Forbidden city is a real marvel- in any aspect."
Crowded but really interesting. I had only a morning to spend here but it was nowhere near enough to explore the place. It is probably good to get a guide for the highlights and then have some free time after to just wander around and take in the scale of the place. So many interesting things to see
"Amazing place, after seeing the movie last emperor and then be able to visit during a business trip. 1 of the 7 Unesco heritage site in Beijing"
"When going in summer; do book your tickets ahead of time! When we went the first time (via Tiananmen Square) we didn’t have the tickets yet and were told (at 10 am) that all 80.000 tickets for that day had already been sold. Just think about that number for one minute. 80.000!!!

Anyway, we went online and booked tickets through GetYourGuide for the afternoon after. Going in the afternoon and taking the east entrance was the best decision we ever made. The crowd was far less than the morning before and we had 4 security checks less.

The palace grounds are huge. It really is a city within a city! It has alleys, side streets, big buildings, small buildings etc. After a while they all start to look the same though.

It is for sure a must see in Beijing and I may come back here with my husband one day but will plan that either in spring or autumn!"
"Great experience and the history is amazing. Incredibly crowded on Tuesday. It's closed on Mondays so Tues is the busiest day, I learned. Still, so glad to have the opportunity to see this beautiful icon of Chinese history."
A beautiful place to visit! We hired a guide and we very much learned so much more about the history of this amazing place!
"The Forbidden City has become an iconic symbol of China throughout the world, and for good reason. If you're traveling in Beijing, you absolutely must make time to see it and perhaps even set aside an entire day for it if you're a fan of history.

It's important to note that the rules surrounding the Forbidden City are constantly changing, so always keep your information as up to date as possible. For example, you now have to buy your tickets online using your passport number and you are not issued with a physical ticket or e-ticket. Instead, you simply go to the gate and they check your passport, so remember to take your passport with you.

The best way to get there is to take the underground to Tian'anmen East or West station, and then follow the signs for the Palace Museum (故宫博物馆). The Forbidden City is almost invariably called the Palace Museum in English, which can be quite confusing.

We've been to the Forbidden City more times than we can count (starting with our first trip in 2006), and it has become increasingly crowded over the years. For this reason, we'd strongly recommend visiting on a weekday rather than on the weekend, as this is when it's at its quietest.

You could easily spend at least 4 hours wandering throughout this vast complex. A particular highlight for us is the imperial garden, which is at the furthermost corner of the city complex. It's startlingly different from the rest of the palace and, in spite of the crowds, it can be quite peaceful. Another personal favourite is the library, which is the only building that has a black roof. This is because the colour black is associated with water in Chinese culture, so they believed a black roof would protect the library from fire. As of April 2019, however, the library is undergoing renovation and is not open to the public.

Once you're finished exploring the city itself, we'd strongly recommend paying a visit to Jingshan Park, which is directly opposite the northern exit. If you climb the hill in Jingshan Park, you'll be treated to a stunning panoramic view of the Forbidden City!"
"When I first visited the Forbidden City in September 2008, I was totally blown away by its grandeur, by the magnificently artful architecture, by the mural, the hall of treasures. I spent half a day crawling over every square foot of the property inspecting every tiny detail, and ooo-ing and ahhh-ing along the way. So I was excited for my husband to see it during my return trip summer 2019. What a shocking difference.

First, the security line didn't exist in 2008. Back then we meandered all over Tian An Men Square, admiring the beauty of the Olympics displays before entering the south gate of the Forbidden City. This time, despite arriving before 8:30 a.m, we waited in line for 30 minutes to arrive at a security checkpoint, where we showed our passports and deposited our bags in an x-ray machine. The entire 30 minutes, we were pushed and crowded, stabbed by umbrellas, stepped on and nearly crushed by locals trying to squeeze ahead of us as the lanes narrowed.

Passing through security gained us entrance to the Tian An Men courtyard, where another line, one full city block long and several people wide, wove across the property. People were waiting to buy admission tickets. Our group headed to the city gate and spent 15 minutes being herded like cattle toward the entrance, pushed and shoved by people with the same destination. Once through the gate, we waited yet again while our guide collected tickets he'd purchased online. We were barked at in Mandarin by a staff member, who pointed to a place where he wanted us to wait.

When our guide got us through the admission gate, we were again barked at by staff with megaphones. They wanted us to move along so we didn't block the entrance.

I was astonished, and appalled, at the number of people on the grounds by 9:30 a.m. It was packed with bodies everywhere I looked. There must have been two thousand people in the outer courtyard alone, pushing toward the city.

I can't tolerate claustrophobic touring scenarios, so Hubby and I split from our group and meandered around the edges of the city, which most of the populace seemed to avoid. But when we wanted to get closer to any of the main buildings, we were nearly trampled. And I was extremely disappointed that every single display was fenced off or roped off so visitors couldn't get anywhere near enough to get a good view of the ancient treasures inside. We saw literally nothing inside any of the buildings in the city.

We headed over to the Hall of Treasures, which requires an additional admission fee. But when we arrived, another line of tourists was snaking around the entrance while people waited to get in. I simply refused to stand in yet another admission line in 95 degree heat, so we skipped the most important display in the city.

We stopped in one of the souvenir shops, but departed quickly after being pounced on by a staff member promoting the purchase of paintings.

The royal garden was the only part of the city that wasn't totally thronged with people. It was cooler there in the shade, and pretty. So we rested awhile in the garden and took a few photos.

I would never have visited again, had I known what a cattle round-up this attraction has become today. The number of visitors here should be better managed - limited to a specific number daily. Visitors could purchase tickets in advance for a selected date and time. Maybe the crowds at Forbidden City aren't so overwhelming in off season, but do yourself a favor and avoid it like the plague during high season."
Just another item on the bucket list. Didn't disappoint. Very crowded but that is what I expected. Definately need a guide to give you information. Allow at least half a day to see properly.
Nice guided tour of the history. Lots of walking but there’s a lot to see. Very crowded. Very informative.
"This area is for those interested in Chinese history and architecture. Maybe something to visit, but if in Beijing, half day would be enough. Gardens around are nice. Metro stops are nearby, so it is easy to go.To enter Tiananmen square and forbidden city, passport is required. Audio guide is available almost in all languages."
"It‘s worth it to see the forbidden city! When we went to see the city, we didn‘t now where to go because everything is huge and there are daily 90‘000 visitors. So when you see the big entrance (picture attached) just go 90 degres to the right and there is a little house that sells tickets. You need your passport and prepare the money (April to October: CNY 60 & November to March: CNY 40). If you have this ready, you should get the tickets in about 5mins. You can also do it online and put in your passport number. Because the passport is your entrance ticket. After that you can stay in the line to go in (small security check). We went trough there in about 5mins. We saw that chinese people like to follow other people. So one line was almost empty (left) and the one on the right was packed full^^ So just think a little bit. You can see the logic also in the picture attached.

It can be very hot and it‘s absolutely not wrong to bring water and an umbrella (for sun or rain).

You should also visit the tiananmen square and the landmarks around.

We personaly didn‘t like the forbidden city that much. But you should see it once!"
"It is as if you are transported back in time when walking through the palace . One needs to spend around 3 hours in this place . Can book your tickets online. Good to take the automatic
Walking guide which cost 40 yuan per person."
"She constantly referred to the movie The Last Emperor and used it to bring this palace to life! She kept relating the various rooms to event in his life, ending with having us pose for photos with a postcard of the Emperor and his family. She made it fun."
"We enjoyed seeing the forbidden city, but it was packed full of tourists in some very narrow spaces and was a bit overwhelming. We couldn’t wait to leave. You have to buy your tickets in advance or you cant get in as they limit the number of entries per day. I’d suggest printing the tickets as Wi-Fi reception is spotty."
A visit of a lifetime. Just plan for a time other than July or August if you can. There were so many people it was different to move. We visited a few years ago in June it mad a huge difference
There was not clear signs in English to see where to go for the forbidden city. Very hard to find out where to buy tickets and collect audio devices. Once we found it our audio devices would cut in and out. Also there were so many people that you could not move. So we ended up looking on the outer edge of the city then went home. My suggestion would be to book a tour to have a better experience.
"Expected a lot more to be honest, especially as such huge crowds of people queuing to get into Tiananmen Square and then again into the Palace.
So with the heat and the pushing crowds we were already irritable by the time we got in.
I was disappointed to just see lots of dusty cordoned off halls basically.
There are museums dotted around in some of the halls on either side but entry is an additional charge and the crowds were just too big. There was hardly any shade.
It’s a one way system and there are no subway stations at the exit so it was along hot walk home too!
Expected this to be the highlight of my holiday but the wall and Terra-cotta army far outside this tired and frankly neglected spot."
"We went to the Forbidden City in Beijing, certainly worth going to. It was a stinking hot day and so many people a bit too crowded but to be expected. Lots of children there the day we went. So many different nationalities a bit hard to hear the guides speak. It was amazing took us hours to go over, a tiring day but well worth it, highly recommend anyone visiting Beijing to go there."
"You can spend up to a day here and great value only ¥60 each. Don’t need a guide just wander around. Great refreshments although hard to find they are there and cheap.For the tickets, either join a tour group or have local friends help you out; otherwise you might not be able to get in on the day. Get tickets before your actual visit. If you don’t enjoy crowds, think twice before coming."
So many things to see but not enough time. History one can identify with as the last emperor was merely one hundred years ago compared to the pyramids which I find hard to identify with. I will be back.
"The Palace Museum is a must-see in Beijing, but it's not necessarily a top-rated experience. What once was a 'forbidden city' of emperors is now a sprawling complex of endless restored buildings, stairs and squares. It makes for beautiful pictures if you manage to leave endless waves of thousands (mostly Chinese) tourists out of the frame. For a foreigner like myself, these tourists might be the biggest attraction.
The exit of the palace is on the north side, which lacks subway stations. Prepare other means of transportation to get home afterwards!"
"It is a pity most of the venues were not accessible at it is fenced up. As such, most stuff can only be seen from far away. Too crowded also and people are carrying umbrellas everywhere and can potentially hit you if you are not careful.

I have been to Palace of Versailes and other museums in Europe. It gives you better experience and interactions as compared to the Forbidden Palace. It is a waste as the place is amazing."
"Very nice historical place. Easily accessible by subway.60 Yuan ticket. If you are traveling in summer with sunshine so it will be hot so you must take the hat, umbrella ,alot of water etc"
Plan on 2-3 hours to see it all. Lots and lots of walking. Big crowds. My favorite part was the garden at the end. The buildings are beautiful but all start to look the same.
"Come early. Definitely come early.

Their are a number of security checks so it’s best not to have any baggage ( although the process is generally quite quick). There are line ups to get through so coming early is a good idea.

The Forbidden city is beautiful and quite amazing to explore. Courtyard after courtyard of walled areas. Beautiful detailing on the buildings.

The museum areas have displays and more information on the history of the forbidden city."
"Excellent place in China, A very big man made lake is one of the best thing here. A cool place even in hot summer"
"Of course it's must see in Beijing but is extremely crowded with people that would cut in line and push you.
Try to buy the ticket online and don't forget to bring your passport."
"Forbidden City was #1 in my list of places to visit. I was planning to spend an entire day there. I ended up staying only for about an hour, skipped 90% of the sites and hurriedly left because I was getter ng claustrophobic.

The place is huge but so is the crowd. Takes the pleasure out of visiting. And during summer it is exceedingly hot, even if you use an umbrella. I felt like I was washing my face with my sweat."
"I expected the venue to be extremely fun since I am interested in Chinese history since young but the tour was extremely disappointing.

Most of the venues were not accessible and old mounments can only be seen from far away. There weren’t much that we can take away from the lifestyle of people in the Forbidden Palace then. The buildings are attractive and pretty but starts to get old after a while.

I strongly recommend other places and think that you can simply look at the pretty pictures of the Forbidden Palace on the internet."
"Love historic sites? Then come visit. Do however be aware that there is not much explanation to what you see in English, so for non-native speakers it a bit of a challenge without a guide or guidebook. Its however fascinating to see how the roof has been build and a close up of all the small figures of the rooftops.
You can spend many hours walking around soaking up history or just walk quick along the mid line of the palace museum - up to you! Take your time to also climb the coal hill on the back side (across the street) of the palace museum and from the top enjoy the view of the palace museum roof tops."
There is nothing like walking through the past of China. It is amazingly complex and unbelievable. Built during the 15th century within the forbidden city complex. a must visit for anyone interested in the last imperial dynasty in China
"We went on a Sunday, it was 34C and there were thousands of people. You did experience a sense of history which with being in China s many thousands of years. The garden courtyards toward the rear/end of the tour were calming despite the crowds. I love how the put info badges on trees to indicate how old they are."
was okay but small very hot and I visited in April. Wasn't worth waiting in line. The bus we took stopped here and didn't need to stop
"nice place to see some sculptures and artefacts of the old times, often too crowded and quite dark to take photos."
The Forbidden City is very large. There are not a lot of opportunities for shade so be prepared for that and large crowds. There is a store inside that sells water and ice cream. Beautiful architecture. Wish we could have seen more of the inside.
Very crowded remember to take water with you on the hot days lots of walking but worthwhile you can get a private english speaking guide. Speak to the concierge in your hotel
"Something everyone should do. It takes around 3 hours because of the queues. Take hat, sunscreen, water, walking shoes"
If you don't like crowds and being pushed around then don't go. The stories were interesting as were the buildings but hard to get a sense of a place somewhere people lived. You couldn't go in any buildings and half the time you couldn't see in even because of the crowds. It was over 35'C as well
"This was a Very interesting place with a lot of history. All l can say is , go, listen to a tour guide our find one that can E plain the history as it's fascinating. Highly recommended"
"The Forbidden City is a must see in Beijing! There is a lot of walking, so wear comfortable shoes. I use a cane at times and did so for this tour! Wear comfortable cool clothes and bring a cold pack for your neck, a fan, and water. It is worth the experience!"
"Forbidden City is well worth it for anyone who wants to see and learn more about ancient China. The centre axis tends to be really packed, but a walk along the eastern side has many worthwhile sections and is significantly less crowded. Be warned, I thought it would only take about an hour to complete, but found that it took significantly more time. After every turn, there's another building to explore. I recommend giving yourself half a day in order to move at your own pace."
"We arrived prior to the 8.30am opening on a very hot day. There were lots of people but it wasn't too difficult to move around. You go through airport type security to access the front of the City, then again once entering the City itself. It's a huge complex & all signs have English.
Personally I prefered the walk on top of the outer wall. This shows the scale of the Forbidden City via the many roof lines that can be seen.
Jingshan Park, behind the City, is the highest point in Beijing & offers a great perspective on the city.
I recommend you get there early & take an umbrella or hat to beat the heat."
"you need a full day to see this, very interesting and a lot to see we went with a tour guide who could explain a lot of the history"
"Just go and see and salivate! A truly astonishing experience. As preparation I would suggest visitors might enjoy watching Bernardo Bertolucci's movie, The Last Emperor, filmed inside parts of the palace, for an insight into what life was like for those who lived in The Forbidden City."
An interesting place with amazing architecture but the best part is the stories around it. Difficult to see in some rooms due to state of windows and number of people
"Iconic. Very crowded so do three things:1. make a meeting place for if someone gets lost. 2. bring water, an umbrella, and a frog togg, 3. make the time and find spaces to soak it all in- especially in the shaded gardens."
"My family and I took a private tour of the Forbidden City on Saturday. William was our guide and he did an excellent job explaining to us the vast history of the place. His intensity and passion for the place had us all paying attention. He was also very good in explaining the information to us, Americans, since our cultures are so different!
The cultural artifacts in the museum inside are a must see. Great trip overall, we ended up buying gifts too, at the gift shop inside."
"It is nice. However, the day we went was very hot and there's no trees or nice points to stop and rest. Everything looked the same as well. But is nice."
"Until you visit, it is hard to imagine the physical size of the place. An enormous expanse of pavillions and palaces, some 980 buildings, 9999 roms, that just seem to go on and on. This served as an imperial palace during the Ming and qing Dynasties. We went in the morning, but even then it was so crowded, we couldn't see some of the palaces/pavillions due to the sheer numbers of people. However, I would not have missed it. Protected by a moat which is 20 feet wide and walls 32 feet high, no wonder they called it the Forbidden Palace."
I stayed very close to the Forbidden City as it was a must on my trip to Beijing. It was very hot so wear comfy shoes and take plenty of water so you don't have to stop. I got there early and it was still crowded. A very popular place to visit. I stayed over 3 hours and still dont think I saw everything but I was happy with what I did see. Most of the palace has been restored and is impressive. A great thing to do to get fabulous views over the Forbidden city is to go to Jingshan Park (entry about 2RMB) and climb the hill to take photos and get a sense of the enormity of it all.
A must see in Beijing but it is vast and very crowded. Might be better to pre-book tickets for afternoon slot and try then as I went in morning. Useful if you don't want to get an audio guide is to have a map and guidebook for the site - it is hard to grasp what you are looking at otherwise. The treasure gallery I was underwhelmed by but the sheer grandeur of the place is worth the ticket price.
"I would 100% recommend going to see the forbidden city! It’s a place to behold, it so huge and gorgeous it will not disappoint!! Defiantly worth the couple of hours you can spend there. The only disappointment is you can no longer go inside the rooms, which I’m guessing is due to mass tourism and wanting to keep them pristine."
"I last visited the Forbidden City some 16 years ago. Back then, you could wander around, but most buildings were off limits. Now, it is called The Palace Museum, and many of the palaces within are open, with many exhibiting treasures. Note that tickets must be purchased online and you need to provide them with your travel document (passport) number. You will then use you passport as your ticket to enter. For a view of the entire Forbidden City, trudge up Jingshan Park at the end of visit. I didn’t do this as it was a 37-deg day! It’s also a long 2.3km walk back to the Tian’anmen East train station, from which I arrived."
Didn't book a ticket. Lined up at 8am. As soon as you go through the gate turn right to buy your ticket. Then line up for the security check. Only pet peeve. House of the glock and other halls you have to buy another ticket there. Not sure why they can't include that into the entry price.
"The forbidden city is a must see for a part of global history. A lay person may never understand the grand history of the forbidden city. My wife and I have seen many historical places around the world but, this is the first time in a communist country. I can say that we felt as safe as if we were in pur home town in the USA. The people from soliders to the lower class campesinos made us feel like we were locals. I highly recommend this spot to understand world history and Chinese history."
"This significant palace precinct deserves at lease 4 hours to enjoy at your leisure. Yes, there are crowds, but don't skimp on the Treasury Area which as the best and most secluded insights into Old Beijing. The gardens are also worth pausing and reflecting on their history. We booked our tickets through the Hotel to allow scheduled intakes; but don't be alarmed...as long as you enter before the end time you can stay until the last entry."
The place was absolutely packed the day me and my partner went. Huge line to get in. And once in you just had to join the mass and walk along with them. Trying to view anything up close was impossible. There's no orderly queue so you just have to fight your way to the front for any of the exhibits. Maybe try and book the earliest slot available? Other than that the palaces and statues are well look after and amazing!
this was the imperial palace of mink dynasty and quing dynasty. it is spread over a very large area. it was forbidden for common people.
The forbidden city is a must visit. The building are incredible and the stories are mesmerizing. It’s hard to appreciate how amazing it is until you’re there! Be prepared to walk for a long time since the area is larger than you can imagine. The staff are not the best at English but they try :-)
"You need your passport to enter. Expect long lines, too many people, unpleasant staff, and people spitting. I finally left early since there was so much smog and the crowds made it hard to enjoy myself."
"Forbidden City served as the home of emperors and the ceremonial and political center of Chinese government for
500 years. It is a must-see place in Beijing."
"You cannot leave Beijing without seeing the forbidden city/Palace museum. Be prepared for big crowds and a lot of jostling. Take water as it’s a early big place with a lot of walking and if it’s hot you will need it. There’s not a huge amount of shade, so wear a hat or (like the locals) take a sunshade. I’m sure you can find a vendor in Tiananmen Square outside.

Be aware that there is a not a lot of indoor experience here. Most of the original exhibits from here were taken to Taiwan when the Japanese invaded, and are in the Taipei Museum."
"Wow, the place it huge! There were a lot of people but had no problem walking around. We had a guide that we were traveling with that filled us in with the history and information of each area we visited. Wish we had more time. Must do!"
"The forbidden city had nice heritage structures, but a concrete jungle and most of the structures similar and bored quickly and lots of walking."
Today we visit the Forbidden City and Jingshan Park. It takes approx. 1 day to visit the forbidden city in all details (maybe longer). There is fore sure a security check on the entrance. The best time to start is in the eraly morning on a weekday. Otherwise too many people. Take water with you.
"Arrived around 3pm on a Saturday afternoon. It was hot and busy! We came with a guide who had great info on the various places and houses, but actually you could come for a nice walk around the lake, over the various bridges and pick up info along the way."
"Plan to spend several hours here- you have to buy tickets early (before noon) bc they only sell a certain number a day. Get the audio tour, it is very helpful."
"We arrived at the South Gate (Meridian Gate) of the Palace entrance around 10:30 am. We had originally planned on going earlier, but as it we experienced heavy rain in the morning, we decided to wait out the rain. Getting to the Meridian Gate was a little tricky as there were no signs on the road once we walked out of the subway station. Given how popular the Forbidden Palace is, you would think there would be multiple signs indicating the directions to the South Gate.

On this day, we were hoping that the rain may have discouraged some of the crowds, but no such luck. As we started getting closer to the South Gate, we saw the large crowds gathered waiting for the tours to begin. Many of the people heading into the palace were as part of tour groups.

There is a security check point before you can even purchase a ticket for the palace. Once you go through the security check point, you turn into the first arched entrance. The ticket office is located on the right-hand side of this arched entrance. The next lot of security check points are then located directly ahead of the arched entrance. There are touts that attempt to scare you into purchasing entrance tickets through them, but don’t believe what they say. Although they were saying ‘you have to wait for more than an hour to buy tickets’ this was untrue. We waited perhaps, half-hour to 45 minutes to buy our tickets. You’ll need your passports to purchase tickets and the as there are no physical tickets handed out to you, you need to present your passports again to gain entrance.

The largest number of crowds were located along the street before the first entrance and the section before the Meridian Gate. Walking through the Meridian Gate is also extremely busy.

But once you enter the complex through the gate, the crowds seem to thin out. There were toilet facilities on the right-hand side of the Meridian Gate that we used and they were acceptable, although not as clean as they should have been.

We had allowed ourselves at least five-hours to visit Forbidden Palace expecting to see much of the structures inside and out. However, only a few of the structures were open to the public on this particular day, which was disappointing. Mostly we were just walking from courtyard to courtyard, observing the structures from the outside. The sections that were open was worth a visit. I suppose, we were expecting to get a look inside each of the building to see what it they were like.

Again, there was very little shade around, except for a few buildings that had some seating, that seemed to be always occupied. As the day was very hot and humid (after the rain), the few ice cream sellers were extremely popular and busy. We spent approximately, three hours and then walked out of the north gate to bus stop 101."
"Such a huge place for the amount of people who lived here and like anywhere else we visited, so busy. Security checks in place so remember your passport. Some in our group were asked to show theirs.
We had a guide who explained the history of the palace which in my opinion is a must.
A small garden tucked away at the back which is like an oasis after all the solid courtyards.
In the heat, there is a lot of walking and steps so be prepared."
Beautiful buildings but such a big area with so many of similar ones it became a bit repetitive though we did appreciate the history and it's meaning to the Chinese people. I guess they would have more in Common with them so we're more fascinated than foreigners.
"Get here early, not to avoid the rush, as it just gets busy from the start. Also baggage x-ray machines operate plus the usual personnel checks. It wash cash only at the entrance when we visited. Best to take the official offer of the talking guide machines."
This is one of the highlights of a China tour. The history and the site is of important historical knowledge and it can be a little overpowering however a must to visit.
"If you are in Beijing this is something you HAVE to go and see. This is such and incredible landmark, The home of the last Emperor of China.

I had similar feelings walking through the front gates as I did when I arrived at the Taj Mahal. The expanse of the grounds are phenomenal, the architecture is stunning and depending on the ticket you get you can also enter some of the palace buildings and the palace Museum.

Check whats on before you go, as when I went there was an incredible Cartier archive exhibition, one of the best I have ever been to, with some incredibly famous items on display.

The grounds of the palace are immense, give yourself at least 3 hours to go around and make sure you have water with you as Beijing in the summer is boiling.

When you arrive, make sure you have your passport with you as the security checks to enter the palace are very strict."
There is not a lot remaining in modern China of the centuries past. The Forbidden City and Palace Museum is huge and generally quite crowded. Grab a guide because there is a lot to learn
"This place is beautiful but very very crowded. I love all the history and the architecture of this massive place, if you can hire a guide is well worth it because there is so much information about this place that is good to have someone well informed to tell you about the history behind this gem.
I just have a suggestion try not to go on a major chinese holiday because this place gets super crowded. In the summer months is really hot and humid and some days the heat is unbearable."
Worth the visit . We visited during a splendours of China trip and I was so glad we went to see this. Would recommend it.
"Second time for me, visiting the Forbidden City. Last time I was short of time so it was more a rush through, ear dropping on other guides... This time a dedicated guide - Joy of Gray Line took us through and around the Forbidden City, giving as the insight on how the life was back under the imperial time in China - fascinating indeed.

Even if you’re not too much interested in history a visit to the Forbidden City is a must while visiting Beijing.

Patrik"
"The Forbidden City was built in the 15th Century in the Ming Dynasty and was extensively renovated in the Qing Dynasty in the 18th Century. Due to its history it is easily one of the top tourist attractions in Beijing and I thoroughly enjoyed it.

The entirety of the buildings are mesmerizing and have a certain beauty despite the fact that they have been worn down throughout time. There are signs indicating the history and the significance of the Halls and Palaces. The Eastern and Western Palaces house artifacts, giving them a more traditional museum feel while the Halls are mostly for viewing from the outside. There is also the Imperial Garden, which has its own significance as the retreat of the imperial family and models after the traditional designs of Chinese gardens.

The Forbidden City doesn't take on the traditional museum approach, but its history and significance throughout the Qing and Ming Dynasties is what makes it worthwhile to visit and keeps it as one of the top destinations in Beijing."
"Stunning palace complex with incredible authentic Chinese architecture!
We visited the palace on Thursday and it was quite full of mainly Chinese tourists.
You will need your passports to be able to visit the inside, so plan for it in advance.
Overall, we really enjoyed our experience inside the complex, you will need to plan 2+ hours to truly enjoy the place."
We were on a tour with SNA and there is a lot of history regarding the palace. I did enjoy the long walk through and listening to our tour guide. I think if you are visiting China and want a little history then this is a must.
"The Forbidden City has always been a magnet for me, more so as over the past few years I have read masses about the Empress XiChi...well worth your time to visit it...and we loved it even more when we found local lasses were dressing up in costume! Just adds that wee bit extra to a wonderful experience...and 'must-do' for y'all...."
"My Visit to China began with my hiking tour of the Great Wall booked through Trippest tours.(see my review) My other tour booked also through Trippest tours was a private guide tour of Tiananmen Square and the Forbidden City.My guide was a 30 year old young lady name Nancy who was not much bigger than my nine year old granddaughter, but she was a delightful person that made me feel very comfortable as we walked the large crowds. Yes I maybe could have done the tour without a guide but for me personally having a local to communicate with even purchasing tickets can be and ordeal, she handled that while i waited. She was so imformed about so many details, I don't think I could be been assigned a better guide for this tour. This was and amazing place to experience from a historical point of view no wonder so many people were there. After the tour we finished with lunch at a nearby restaurant the meal was delicious.With hotel pickup and drop-off combined with a knowledgeable english speaking guide(Nancy)whether a group or private tour you'll be happy with Trippest tours, request Nancy you""ll be happier."
"It's worth going to be able to say you've been there, but I really like the Summer Palace better.
The Forbidden City has hordes of tourists and mostly a straight line of courtyards, staircases, and single-story formal buildings.
You need to use your imagination to bring it to life."
Amazing place and a must to see when in Beijing. Right next to Tiannanmen Square so can see both at same time. Would recommend going up to the pagodas at the exit as get a great view and gives you a better perspective of the actual size of the place. Just awesome.
"During my visit I went through 4 different paying stages. I paid the general entry fee, I paid for an automatic audio guide, I paid to see the clock collection and I paid to get in the area with the 9 dragon wall screen.

I accept that it might be best to have different staff dealing with the audio guides but why not just have an entry fee that gets you in everywhere?

Two things in praise of the ticketing; my proof of age got me senior rates despite being a foreigner and the use of your passport number as your electronic ticket. Just remember to take your passport with you."
Interesting place yes no doubt however if your going with a group as in a tour company. Dont pay them !we paid $160 a couple when admission is only around $20 Australian dollars. Go through and explore yourself
Forbidden City is the first area to visit in China.Unique buildings that you have never seen like anywhere.
"Just think about it. The past ruling Emperors had absolute power. His concubines lived in the eastern flank of the Forbidden City. The Western flank balances the geometry of the city.

Imagine how did they manage to build such marvellous architecture in the distant past. It is an amazing feat and an entirely different experience from our 21st democractic experiences."
"It's also referred to as the Imperial Palace and a must see in Beijing. You get 2 for one as Tiananmen Square is across the street connected by an underpass crossing the multi-lane street. See the square first as the you enter the Forbidden City from that side and exit on the opposite side (one way). There are basically 3 gates, tall stone structures to pass through before you reach the first courtyard. Both places are enormous. If you want see everything be prepared to spend more than 4 hours there."
"The Forbidden City is cloaked in mystery and history, but it wasn't as jaw dropping as I pictured it to be. Definitely worth visiting."
"I’m not going to lie, I really didn’t know much about this place before visiting.

The size is phenomenal, but it’s also stunning to walk around. If you clear your head you can try to imagine how the empowers would have lived here.

Truly stunning. Worth every penny."
After walking through Tiananmen Square we walked under the tunnel and entered the Forbidden City. Boy do you have to be fit for this one. It was thirty four degrees with the heat bouncing off the pavement and we lost count of the number of palaces and buildings that we encountered. Although we didn’t retrace our steps the entire walk was in the order of 9-10 km. You are warned!
"I personally found it to be a bit boring to go through what seems like eternal sequence of palaces and squares, each one looking pretty much as another, and there is no way to escape - you can only move in one direction from the entrance to exit. My favorite part was a beautiful stone garden near the end."
"The selling price of mineral water is 4rmb / 600ml. It's very pricey. Once you get inside the city, there is no more stall selling snack & water. It's very hot in May/June. Under the hot weather, drinking water is always not enough.
The forbidden city is really huge. However, the design of the buildings are almost the same. We walked in the rush due to hot weather and were thirsty too. Honestly speaking, I prefer Taipei Gu Gong than here. Taipei Gu Gong got more things to discover."
Its a very big place to walk through too hot and all gates are similar once you walk from one gate u have to cross next which will be same as first very long passage all halls are closed so cannot go inside the hall and see and once you enter exit is just opposite so must cross whole area although one can see old chinese architecture
Obviously goes without saying this visit is a must see for Beijing visitors. The breath taking Palace buildings and square are second to none. One always has to admire the infinite complexity of the whole Palace complex and how it was conceived. Very highly recommended.
"Overall, historical area in Beijing are clean but the toilet is an issue here! Generally, all toilets (including certain restaurants) are below average in terms of cleanliness and ‘smell’!

The historical architecture and building in Forbidden City is still well kept and maintained.

This is one of the place you shouldn’t miss when visiting Beijing."
A very impressive Palace and surroundings. The history is very interesting and definitely worth then visit. However lots of tourists
"This area is so Beautiful.
You will need to allow plenty of time to walk around and see everything.
The detail on the buildings is all so Amazing.
We were lucky enough to see many young women, dressed in traditional costume for photo shoots."
This is the city which was forbidden earlier to commoners that's how the name it got 'forbidden city'. This was the place of royals and another historical place to visit to know their earlier lifestyle
"This city within Beijing built by the Emperors of history covers an immense square footage that requires a good amount of time to traverse. The buildings are classic antiquity in architecture that must be appreciated for their unique style and craftsmanship. You will find detailed history and artifacts within the buildings, gardens, and get a sense of what it was like during the time of its use. Obviously a must experience if in Beijing. If you are not limited by time explore this place and appreciate its beauty."
"A good history lesson, although you can't get into any rooms, there is a lot of cement and it can get very hot"
Have been here 3 times for the past 15 years and still feel mesmerized. Lot of renovation now especially on the paving block and new wood decking above the stair. We enjoy the most the small palace of empress whereby you can feel the ambience of royal day to day living next to the imperial garden. The emperor must be the loneliest man on the earth.
"Rainy day but still very crowded on that Sunday. Fortunately we had a personal guide (fluent in English) who took us to amazing ""hole in the wall"" restaurant for Hot Pot dinner and stayed with us until 10 p.m. The Forbidden City was very interesting but disappointing to learn that most valuable artifacts displayed were reproductions. The gardens were beautiful and well looked after. Recommend visiting on weekday as soon as open. Tickets must be purchased online and cannot be purchased at any ticket counter."
The trip here was nice. The sight was beautiful. It was a little cool. Great history and picture place...
"The largest palace in the world did not disappoint! My only regret is I didn’t know enough about it before I went but luckily our tour guide shared a lot. It was busy, but manageable due to the size. It took us a good 2 hours to walk through/ around the palaces. So much history and culture, it leaves you a little speechless and in disbelief. Definitely worth a visit so you can walk on the same paves as the last Emperor of China"
"The Forbidden city has been the home of 24 emperors – 14 of the Ming dynasty and 10 of the Qing dynasty. The Forbidden City was declared a World Heritage Site in 1987 by UNESCO. A common myth states that there are 9,999 rooms including antechambers - (this are small rooms leading to a main one!). Well, after all the historical happenings, wars and revolution - the Forbidden City still has 980 surviving buildings with 8,886 rooms today! Don't think about it - you don't make, not this day or a week! :) It's a amazing place, everything is huge/spacy - and a lot of beautiful, exciting exhibitions. Follow your guide or make a nice stroll around the forbidden city :) We have been there in the beginning of February some years ago! - not so busy."
"One way only. Must bring your passport. Enter through ticket booth and security scanner. Random people from our tour group were chosen for passport check. Lots and lots of buildings inside this large complex. I would recommend getting an audio tour, we couldn't get much of commentary from our guide as it was too busy. You can't go inside any of the buildings. I enjoyed the gardens inside the complex where all the cherry blossoms were in full flower, it looked very pretty."
Very good place to visit but when the weather is cool . It’s a huge palace converted in to a museum. Usually very crowded strictly avoid on Chinese public holidays . Provides excellent insight in to emperors of Ming dynasty . Each place is labelled in English so going around becomes easy . You need to carry your passport to get the tickets . In fact the passport itself gets scanned as a ticket once you make payment. Try and come early to beat the crowds . The palace and its grounds are beautiful. The jewellery section the throne the watch section the meditation centre all are fantastic. It’s a good way to spend at least four hours . A word of caution : taxi drivers in Beijing loot you and don’t use the meter .So getting back can be costly unless you use the public transportation
A must see! The audio tour explains much of what you’ll see and a bit of history. The museum provides sensory overload - there is so much to see. Tip: bring local currency is you plan to buy a souvenir at one of the gift shops - American credit cards are not accepted.
Very hot and extremely busy. There is no shade so make sure you bring water and a hat. Very interesting
"Lessons learned when visiting FB

1. Buy tickets in advance on trip advisor. If you don’t, expect to stand in a very slow moving line to buy tickets. They only accept cash. Credit cards and apps won’t save you here.

2. It’s going to be crowded. Get used to it.

3. In the summer it’s going to be hot. Get used to it.

4. Umbrellas to protect from the sun are really smart.

5. Bring snacks and water. You can buy them inside but not much.

6. Getting through security at Tienanam Square takes a long time.

7. Plan your escape route. Getting a taxi that charges by the meter is next to impossible at the N gate. So expect to walk a distance before you find one."
"This is an imposing but beautiful space. An average of 80K visit per day and I can see why. The gardens and the lake have a timeless and tranquil feel which shines through despite all the crowds and lines.
The palatial compound is comprised of over 900 buildings which are majestically beautiful with many, intricate cravings and details, all painted in the imperial red.
This takes the entire day to see everything , the museums, shops and restaurants."
"Watch the crowds on weekends, worth booking tickets ahead of time and ensure you bring your passport for entry."
"We were so surprised that the forbidden City were not open to public before, but that were changed, they opened it to public to visit. It was a nice place to visit."
"Grandiosity is an understatement. Don't get overwhelmed by the crowds and push tourists. Pay attention to the details, that's where the palace really shines. Oh, and don't forget to keep an eye out for spirits. The Forbidden City is haunted by the countless that have been executed here."
"The Forbidden City (aka, The Palace Museum) was more than a fortified home of Emperors. It was also where government functioned at the highest level. Today, most of the interiors of buildings are closed to the public. Thus, we get little insight into what daily life was like. Mostly, we get views of the exterior of structures. I rented an audio guide, which gave me a fairly good understanding of what I was viewing, and I read most of the signage. There is much history here, and likely much that we will never know. Well worth a 2 to 3-hour visit."
"Be prepared to walk for miles. The history of this location is so incredible you really need to study before you go there. Because of the extreme interest the authorities limit visitors to 80,000 a day. The limit is needed. Cameras and soldiers are everywhere."
"The Forbidden City is truly a wonder to see. If you have seen the movie, The Last Emperor, then you have the opportunity to see where it was filmed and the absolute immensity of the City. Once you get through the ticket gates, you can wander for hours, although honestly, it all begins to look the same after awhile. I also suggest going at a time with fewer people so you don't feel so surrounded (although in China, that can be difficult to escape.) My favourite part of the City is the Imperial Garden, not only because it provides shade on a sunny day, but the trees are oldy and twisty and great subjects for photos. Definitely a must-see whilst visiting Beijing!"
Lots of palaces to see.It was very cold the day we went.Very old and lots of history in those walls.
"In the middle of Beijing stands a jewel of a place. The Forbidden City is huge with many buildings and gardens to explore all surrounded by a huge wall. Many places are behind plexiglass that has seen the test of time. One can view how the emperor and empress lived not so frugally. There is much gold, jade and semi precious stones adorning the various temples , meeting rooms, living spaces and shrines. Many of the smaller buildings were for concubines which were many and the help which were even more. The best vantage point is thru the north gate, climbing up a large hill to a small temple where you can get a fantastic view of Beijing as well as an overall view of the vast Forbidden City tucked into the middle of this metropolis. With 38 million people in the city expect to rub elbows with the locals. They do not know how to form a queue or be patient. Having said this it really is something to see."
"Take the time to really go through this, ideally with a guide. There is so much in each design that is so carefully thought out and very symbolic. Definitely worth the visit!"
Not many tourist attractions can match this. It is amazing to get closer to this very important and interesting part of China’s history. We went there around 11 am on a Wednesday and it was easy to get in. But inside you should be prepared to be together with many tourists from China. But it is worth it. An electronic devise will guide you in most common languages. It takes 1-2 hours to go through the city (1 km long) with many many ancient buildings that have been well kept.
"What a contrast, you walk out of Tiananmen Square (which is a temple to the ruling party) into the tranquility Of the Forbidden City (well it would be apart from the 1000's of people). Don't let the number of people put you off, this is a spectacular place of hidden gems and well worth the effort and sharp elbows."
"The forbidden city is massive ,it seems endless ,with very little sunshine ,bring water from outside as gets expensive once you get in , remember passport to enter the area."
"It was mind blowing to see in the flesh. A lot of walking and a lot of gates to go through, did not cover half of the complex. After seeing so many films featuring the Forbidden city, it was just incredible to actually walk through this beautiful complex of buildings. The crowds were suffocating in sections as it was a public holiday, but what can you do. Children were dressed in national costume, the mothers very keen for their photos to be taken. This is a place to visit at least once in your lifetime."
"You cannot imagine the grander of this place.
It is absolutely stunning and beautiful.
The crowds are a bit much, but with a little patience you can get through it all.
Just when you think you're at the entrance, it is yet another gate . It just goes tot show you how huge this place is. We did only about 20% of the place. I'll definitely need to go back one day.
Absolutely loved it."
A must do is to visit the Forbidden City the buildings and surrounds are just astounding so beautifully built in the 15th century a Palace for the Ming Emporers
"Gorgeous visit to the forbidden city. Sure it’s crowded but not skin close kind. View was great, a couple of museums and a nice garden with a gift shop. Definitely recommend!"
"This amazing site is a significant piece of history. Impressive in size and scale, today it is only gas one third of the original remaining. You can only view each of the palaces from outside including the emperor throne.

The area does not have much shade. If you go in a hot day an umbrella is recommended. The surface can be uneven at times for walking (and there is plenty of walking) most tour groups go in one way and cone out the opposite side. They use a personal audio system which makes it easy to here the commentary from your guide. Recommended"
"I am pleasantly surprised that i have enjoyed forbidden city for the 2nd time. It was great with the listening aid, and venturing through each all. The VR show is an interesting way to understand the history. Though crowded and hot, the visit is worth. Bring your cap!"
"You can reach her by subway , bus, etc. Subway is the cheapest way to travel and saves lot time, need to buy ticket to go in, it is a huge place to visit u need whole day to see or cover this place, this is a place like a city to know earlier days culture of China their living style and dynasties."
"We have been here before when we were able to enter many of the rooms and view a lot of the exhibits. Unfortunately the powers that be have now locked down all the buildings and whilst you can still visit you only get to see the outside of the building and if lucky you may get the opportunity to peer into an open doorway, that's if you can fight your way through the crowds that are all trying to do the same as you. We did get to see a ""changing of the Guard"" display which was a bit like a ""toy town"" re-enactment with very young men goose stepping with what I am convinced were toy guns, you could see this for yourself at 11.00 every day. Not a place I will return to for another visit as there are now far too many Chinese visitors which makes it unpleasant to compete with as they all want to be in the same place as you at the same time or even before if they can manage it. Tip, take your passport and if you are over 65 you get in for half price."
"However, having said that, there was a lot to photograph and my guide SUSIE was very patient with me doing just that, taking pictures and taking it all in"
We went to the Forbidden City as part of our tour to China. Our guide was well versed in walking us through this large compound and explained to us the rich history of each building. It’s a must visit if you are visiting Beijing.
"It's a amazing place with so many building.
It's very busy place
It's better to buy ticket online
It's a historical place.
It's too difficult for baby and carriage."
"Wander inside the walls of this great city museum for an enchanting historical feel. Easy to navigate with optional guide headsets or live guide. I went solo and managed to see and understand the history with the English guide notation.
A real transportation into another world. Forget everything and enjoy!"
"Very interesting place to visit which i recommend go in the morning cos queue up takes 30 mins or more to enter.. Each place has it's story and beautiful view to take pictures.
Now there's souvenirs in there which you can buy items symbolized Forbidden city.. which i think it's worth it."
"This enormous compound of structures housing 999 rooms is fascinating. The buildings are ornately decorated. Some of the painted decorations were left as they were and others have been restored, which provides a nice mix of old and refurbished. There are lovely gardens and bridges. Make sure you pick up your feet because there are lots of tripping hazards."
This was a great sight and I'm so glad that I went. Getting the tickets can be tricky if you're not alone because you have to get them on WeChat. But there are people to help if you can find them.
Yes this is a marvel. Like Versailles in France. There are few of that caliber in the whole world.But a week day in May the place was more than packed preventing from appreciating the palace. I know this is China and local tourism is huge but frankly it’s difficult to enjoy a visit with such a crowd.
"The Forbidden City is huge containing untold number of buildings. The crowd/mob visiting the city the day we visited was also huge. It thinned out somewhat once you get inside but going through some narrow spaces was challenging. Luckily, I learned the art of polite pushing (Chinese are experts at it). Easy to get lost in the complex and I was happy to follow our guide and listen to her explanations. Place could use some TLC maintenance."
"We entered here from Tianaman Square on Monday and the volume of tourists was overwhelming. The site is huge with many building so crowds are diluted once inside. There are bottlenecks of people though and it's quite claustrophobic. However a truly unique and incredible site, not to be missed. There is no shade inside. I took an umbrella but not terribly useful where there are so many people.
When I go home I will watch the film called The Last Emperor, filmed at this site."
"Despite the comments about crowds, etc., one has to see the Forbidden City to truly appreciate the size and breadth of this site. Be prepared for lots of walking, but there are spots to sit and rest a bit. It would be a shame to miss this site if this is your only visit to Beijing."
This is a must visit when in Beijing. Get ready for a long walk wear comfy shoes but well worth it. Don't go on weekends overcrowded and you have to go through security into the entrance from Tiananmen Square. Half price for seniors. Always take passport with you this acts as your ticket when you pay.
"Why the Forbidden CIty has such a high rating on here is beyond me. It was frigid cold... and packed to the brim with far too many tourists to be enjoyable. Even without that, looking back on my China trip, the Forbidden City was somehow one of the least memorable things we saw.

If you enjoy being packed like a sardine with nowhere to sit and endlessly long distances to walk, while your audio guide that you paid for fails to work, while you get more and more tired waiting for something to impress you, then this is the spot for you. If not, just go to Jinshan Park behind it and look out over it, which is far more impressive."
"May be because it was a Saturday, the crowds were overwhelming. Our only aim is to squeeze ourselves out from the North Gate as soon as possible."
Forbidden City is impressive with the architecture. It’s cool how structures built so long ago have continued to stand the test of time. This place could easily House a concert with no problem. Lots of walking can be done here if you’re a step counter.
"I love in general to visit historical sights. I was full of anticipation for Forbidden palace, being also a big chinese historical drama fan. Maybe because I had too much expectation that it fell short. One thing that I was not prepared for and had a significant negative influence on my experience was the sheer number of tourists. I was prepared for crowds but this far exceeded anything that I had imagined. The other thing is the weather and if it is a hot day then there is practically no shade on the palace grounds and it is simply huge. Hat and water is a must.
One other thing that disappointed me is that one is not allowed to enter any of the rooms unlike the palaces of Europe (understandably given that thousands of people visit everyday) and getting a peak of the interior requires a lot of elbow jostling! It for sure merits a visit for there is so much history but if one can choose then a visit in low season might make for a much pleasanter experience."
"We walked to Tienanmen Square from our hotel (The Regent), which was 2 miles away. We were surprised by the security as we had to show our passports and had our bags searched. The square is enormous and we took the opportunity to visit Mao's mausoleum (no bags or cameras allowed but everyone had there mobile phones out taking pictures). We then went into the museum (had to show passports to get free ticket then more bag searches). The museum is well worth a visit. We then went into the Forbidden City (had to show passports to get our tickets then more bag searches). It took a full afternoon to stroll through the palaces and gardens, which were quite fascinating, before exiting the gate at the far end of the complex and walking back to the hotel. We walked 10 miles that day!"
A massive complex of buildings. Allow plenty of time to walk around.There are wheel chair ramps for access.
Interesting but for me slightly underwhelming. I imagine much of the wealth was stripped before it became a museum.
"Went on weekday but still very crowded. To enter you will need your identification pass (password or id). Rented the audio guide and walked around, spent about half a day there. There are no restaurants inside so advisable to bring some snacks there."
"This place is fascinating to my kids because this is where the emperor once lived. Children are captured by the history, the romance and power that the emperor had which made this place even more mesmerizing. The sheer size, details, and history behind this place is enough to leave anyone in awe, but for us, it was also to show the kids a part of Chinese history."
I have never seen so many people in one place before. Little old ladies even pushing and shoving. Apart from the madness it was an interesting place to visit.
This was ok but not a lot to see apart from the architecture. It was a long hot walk (34 degrees Celsius). Gardens at the end were nice and shady.
Visited here recently as this is a must see for visitors to Beijing. The complex is huge - a fair bit of variety in terms of sights within the gates. The place gets busy so expect crowds. Tickets can be purchased online in advance - as they only allow a set number of visitors per day. The ticket staff at the gates were highly efficient and although it was busy - entry was swift. Foreigners need to take their passports which are scanned to validate the ticket purchased online.
"Miss Betty Xi was our Odynovo tour guide through Tiennimam Square and into the Forbidden City. Betty was so knowledgeable about the history of both places as well as the current uses. My husband and I are nearing 80 years of age, and Betty had to foresee any problems and solve them before they occurred. We truly appreciated the opportunity to see these sites with our limited physical abilities and become more knowledgeable about Chinese history."
The forbidden City is enormous and there is plenty of architecture and history to soak up here. Plenty of tourists here too but we wore ear plugs while here allowing us to listen into the tour guide. You also had to be prepared to push through the crowds to see into some of the rooms
"The entry to the old royal city has the famous image of Chairman Mao on the famous red wall.

There's a clear area of where to take a photo of the wall, and people queue up politely to respect each tourist that was visiting.

As a lot of places in China, it was insanely crowded. It is the capital city of the most populous country in the world, after all. So you'll just have to get used to the amount of people.

To see both the Forbidden Palace, you need to go through security gate that scans your items and checks your ID. This is kind of standard I heard they do the same thing at a lot of, if not all the subways/MRTs in Tier 1 cities (I have only personally seen this in Shanghai). They're super efficient, and we were with a tour guide so it didn't cause any problems for us but it's good to know to bring your passport just in case.

The city contains many gates and gives you insight into the area that the emperors of 2 dynasties did their business. There's a lot to see and walk around but there's not many things explained in English, so I do recommend a guide to explain what everything is.

On of the buildings/halls had a mini exhibitions with statues. One of these was actually one from the terracotta army!

At the back, there's a lovely garden, but again - having a guide to explain what everything is was really useful.

The buildings are beautiful, and the scale impressive, however there are a lot of bare areas and it felt perfectly aligned (which is the aesthetic) and I like a bit more of a mishmash.
But that's personal preference.

As with most tourist areas in Beijing, there are mostly squat toilets with often just 1 or 2 'potty' toilets. So be aware. Most of them give you toilet paper on a roll at the entrance of the block, but I would always carry some with you just in case."
Very interesting place with lots of history. useful to have a tour guide to explain the history - but irrespective the size of this place will amaze you. Lovely garden at the end to break up the hot stone courtyards. A must see.
"What I liked most that due to our Tour and Leo, our guide, we were able to avoid gargantuan lines and ere escorted right to the pass gate. As impressive as that was, beyond the gates, simply took my breath away! I felt to privileged to walk where only Emperors and their ilk had walked before. I really loved he incredible jade art work, like the jade mountain with detailed carvings in the animals and creatures on the mountain. Likewise, the jade bowls, symbolizing the sea. Unbelievable!! There was a lot of walking, but it was all very well worth it. We even saw the Dragon Lady's bedroom and her opera house, where no one but President trump and his wife have been allowed to see a performance in centuries."
"When in Beijing,this is a must. Be prepared for huge crowds. It takes a minimum of 1 hour but the usual is 3. I first saw this in 1990 and over the years,it has become more remote as the halls etc become more protected from crowds. Read about it before you go."
Super worth seeing. Even though there were massive people all over. So much history involved in this place the Forbidden City. Awesome !
"No trip to Beijing should not include a visit to the Forbidden City.
You are never prepared for the scale it is an enormous site so be prepared for a lot of walking"
The Forbidden City is a must see location inn Beijing. Beware that even on a normal day it is VERY crowded and you will be pushed along by the huge crowds. If you can put that aside and just go to take it all in without getting hung up on taking tons of pictures you will enjoy it more.
"I’m always torn on what to think of places like this. It highlights in an amazing way the culture of the past. But that culture is one that I don’t find particularly flattering (emperor gets everything while others suffer).

It’s a must see if you go to Beijing."
Step back in time and imagine the Imperial past of China - and keep going to the gardens on the Hill behind. Wear sneakers for comfort. Lots of walking and uneven surfaces.
"MUST visit to believe. This place is huge with tons of halls to visit.
Amazed at how many tourist visit this place and there will be tons of tour groups.
Definitely get audio guide for non-chinese speakers which is GPS operated (very cool).
Read about this place before you go, it helps to understand important artifacts in each hall and its significance.

Take some snacks to eat along with drinks. you will get tired"
"You have to go there once in Beijing, but it’s really busy and you can’t visit the most interesting part of the city. It’s beautiful, but kind of boring..."
"Great sight, lots of walking and many stairs. We spent about two hours in the complex. That wasn't enough to see it all, but it was a good dose. We bought the supplemental ticket for the treasury and museums on the East side of the property, it was well worth it, the museums have a lot of great artifacts and the buildings in that area are some of the best we saw.

Speaking of tickets; buying tickets on-line (as recommended) was a bit of a hassle, so we just walked up to the ticket counter at the entrance and bought tickets, there was no waiting line. There is a second ticket window inside the Palace for the Treasury sights.

It gets kind of warm, but there were a few places to relax with ice cream and cold drinks."
"to me it was my first visit to the Forbidden City; and i will never forget this experience; never expected that this City was and still is the Centre of Beijing.
to experience the former daily life in this enormous complex was devastating. and if you have the privilege to be guided by a personal guide, you are very greatful that you were able to visit this Chinese symbol"
"Beijing is the capital of China and well-known city with a lot of history. I visited Beijing this February. I visited the Forbidden City. It is really marvelous and amazing! The buildings inside is full of oriental style. The treasures inside are really fantastic! I am so into this Museum!
I will visit Beijing again in one day!"
"As a small group we traversed Tian’anmen Square towards The Forbidden City. The Square per say is big and used as a public meeting place, within the square can be found The Monument to the People’s Hero, a Mausoleum, The Great Hall of the People and The National Museum of China. My interest lay in exploring The Forbidden City though, taking too many photos and exploring the History and Halls. I wasn’t to be disappointed, so much to see when passing through the Gate of Heavenly Purity, through to the Hall of Middle Harmony and to the centre via the Gate of Supreme Harmony. Looking on the way at the Bronze Cauldrons, Imperial Sundial, the lovely Lions and Qylinn the punisher of Evil and Wickedness. The stunning Architecture of the roofs and symbols, storehouses and offices of Officials made time fly too quickly. A visit not to be missed but overcrowded (as to be expected) on Official Holidays so try to avoid it then. I was not too keen on the Museum, I found it crowded and unable to see the exhibits due to so many people at the glass panes."
"A vast site full of history. It is amazing the stories that are captured within the walls that the emperor lived. If you haven’t visited before, I would strongly suggest that you go on a organised tour. There were approx 80,000 people that visited the site the day we went but we Bobby feel cramped at all. Be prepared to walk as Fitbit suggested we took 17,000 steps. A few stairs as well but plenty of ramps as well. Suitable for wheelchairs."
"The area in the palace is huge. Do allocate at least 4 hours and more if you want to cover every section of the palace. But it’s definitely worth visiting.
Just avoid public holidays if you can"
"One of the most amazing places we ever visited. Everything was Nice. We love it so much, absolute a must see in the World."
Very interesting place. Make sure you get there early as tickets sell out fast. We had two goes at going last morning we were there at 8.30 and got tickets so many people with same idea mainly tour groups. Make sure you go to the park just outside exit of forbidden city it has amazing views over the city.
"Be prepared for a long walk. It's one way in and one way out. You go through 3 temple's which are all relevant and have a story to tell. Again, if you can go early as the crowds soon arrive and there are lots of steps as you go along."
"Getting to Forbidden City is as easy, the inter subway is much convenient. Do not take bus as the traffic is quite bad. Subway you can alight at Qianmen station and cut true Tiananmen. Forbidden city can be crowed at time, you need at least 3 to 4 hrs to true the city."
"We used a private guide from Catherine Lu Tours, for a stopover in January 2019. Our guide was so helpful and informative about the history. She navigated us through the security checks with ease, and knew where to find a 'western toilet'. Loved the experience of seeing this historical place and learning about the history behind it. Our tour was 8 hour day, and included lunch which we had just before entering the Forbidden City. Lots of easy walking."
"This was great to do...
The seven magnificent gates, the squares, the history, the architecture, etc all make it a 'must see'.
It's quite a trek, much longer than i expected, so wear comfy shoes 😁
It will also be busy. It's significance means it will always be well attended, so expect crowds.
It's still well worth a visit.
Also Tiananmen Square is opposite, so if you get the chance, see both."
"Lots to see but very busy. Buy your tickets in advance. 2 hours is enough time here. Lots of people, avoid public holiday time"
I enjoyed the many gardens. It was a tranquil experience. There was seating in some of the courtyards and seating in the gardens. You can sit a while an just take in the sights and enjoy the calm atmosphere. I certainly recommend a visit.
"We were taken around by our guide and got so much more than a guidebook could give you. The courtyards within courtyards as you approach the Palace of Earthly tranquility just become more elaborate and allow you to imagine how the Emperor lived with his wives, concubines, servants and soldiers. The effects of the invading armies is interesting and I’m sure you could spend days soaking up all the history here. Yes a definite Must Do in Beijing.
There are two sets of toilets ... the furthest from the admissions area has no queues and is cleaner. As others have said do remember your water and passport"
We spent some 4 hours (probably needed 8!) wandering round. It truly is a living testament of the beauty that can be created so many years ago. Craftsmanship is mind blowing.
"Another must see whilst in Beijing, I would organise your trip independently by using subway as much easier, and can buy any tickets there and then"
"It's like the Russian dolls, Courtyards within courtyards. When you think you have seen them all....there are more. No trees, as people could hide behind them. The visit took a full day as it included Tiananmen Square. BYO lunch and drink. 1st traffic lights up the road is where the guy stopped the tanks. Apparently he has not been seen since. You defiantly need a guide here as there is so much to know. We were amazed at the size and splendor of the compound. I guess you need a lot of rooms when you have 3000 concubines. Do not miss it, it is magnificent."
Be prepared to walk a lot amidst the hordes of people. Best also if there is a guide to explain. The artifacts inside aren't as complete and impressive than the museum in Taiwan though.
It is incredible to see what the people of that time were able to construct and design. The glazed tiles are as if they were made today.
"Probably one of the most interesting places to visit in Beijing. Do not forget your passport, otherwise you will not be able to enter. No lighters allowed! Security check is required. Saturday and sunday there are a lot of people, if possible visit on a working day. You will need at least 1:30 hours to go through."
"It was a rainy day in Beijing and we had tickets to the Forbidden City. We arrived early and spent almost the whole day here. You could easily come back several days and still not experience it all. We stopped in one of the several tea houses for some lovely ginger tea, which warmed us up. There’s way too much here for one day. Even though the crowds seemed huge going in, the size of the place allowed us to spread out and be happy."
"This is a must see but with a guide who can give a complete history of the Palace which will give you a greater experience, you need to allow a few hours, take a camera and good walking shoes."
"It's a must see attraction while in Beijing but be prepared for large crowds. Even more so during the national holiday month of October. Still worth walking around and taking in the essence of what life used to be like under the various Imperial Families. The more time you spend there, the more you appreciate it!!"
"Interesting place to visit in China,we came with family to meet our daughter she is study there in China"
Get a tour have your passport. It’s a great thing to see the way it was before all the trees removed can be experienced in the back where the concubine residence is. Beautiful structures.
"A magnificent ancient palace, definitely a must-see while visiting Beijing. It may take a whole day to enjoy every part of this sprawling structure. It can get overly crowded, especially at the palace garden. Make sure to visit the museum shops, as they sell various exquisite gifts."
"The palace is huge; we have to walk about 15 min from the subway, pass tiananmen square before reaching the entrance to the palace. We went on the eve of May 1. The crowd was crazy; there must have been at least 60000 people there!

Security was tight, we had our bags checked before entering. Do check the website in advance to see how many tickets are available as only 80000 tickets are on sale per day. Getting tickets shouldn't be a problem if it's not a holiday. We got our tickets on the day, there was no queue. Visitors above 60 gets half-price tickets.

We recommend getting an audio tour or a tour guide to explain the rich history behind each building. We got the audio tour at 40rmb (20rmb for Mandarin). Audio tour wasn't great, but it gives us some details about the history, instead of just walking around looking at buildings. The audio sensor automatically detects our location, and will start playing. However, the sensor sometimes fails to detect.

The Chinese aunties likes to push their way through to view the buildings. The shoving and pushing was especially bad at popular main buildings. During non-holiday times, you can enjoy sitting under the trees in one of the small courtyards.

There are only 2 toilets within the palace. Thankfully, they are pretty clean. There're cleaners working during the day to ensure cleanliness.

Be sure to bring lots of water and snacks/lunch, to last the day.

Amazing, must-visit place! It's worth visiting each building/courtyard as each one has its history and story."
"its exposed to everyone . . . . . .. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
so tired a no we have to walk long time its big i cant think of a single nice thing about it"
Again if you’re touring China (preferably with a guide) you will have this on your list. It doesn’t disappoint & the guide gives a wonderful ongoing chat of the history. Wonderful.
The forbidden city is an extremely popular tourist stop. However even with the many thousands of people it doesn't feel extremely crowded because the city is just huge. A must see in Beijing.
"+ Very interesting place
+ So big, you can walk around all day
+ There are place to stop for lunch
+ Toilets around, convenient

- On the weekend can be too many people, will take awhile to get in"
"Absolutely amazing. Wish I could have had the day to wander through all the sections and soak it up. Mind blowing architecture and environment, but spoilt by so many Domestic tourists and very smelly toilets. This place is definitely worth spending more time in."
"Get the entrance tickets organized in advance as they run out very quick, there is only a limited number of tickets available per day.
If you the city by yourself, i recommend to have a map and plan what you want to visit in advance. Some areas required a different ticket, you can buy them inside."
"You could spend many hours here wandering. It was crowded when I was here because it was a holiday, however because it is so big, it didn’t feel overwhelming"
The Forbidden City is a must see place. Very busy but worth the journey. Allow quite a few hours to take it all in.
"I came here with my boyfriend and we were both astonished by how fabulous it is.

It was elaborated by thousands of people in history, and was representing the power of Empire for a long time, which means it was a forbidden area for normal citizens, but now, here I am, standing inside of it and thinking about my own life, it’s really amazing."
"It's was my fourth times to visit the Forbidden City. Gave me different images every time. This trip. I managed to see some different things which I never saw them before, especially inside the Clork and Jewel museum. Also, went to Cining Palace where was a residential for Dowager Empress. What a pity in 2019, Forbidden City is undergo the renovation, can see many worker are try to repaint the red pillars. Many palace were closed under refurbishment period, especially Yangxing Dian. 10 pictures unable to show how much I love Forbidden City. Hope to see you next time with new looks."
Rightly world famous. Very crowded so take your time to stroll around without feeling stress. Enjoy all the fine details of the temples and artefacts.
The buildings were fabulous altho you can only look inside not enter. Amazing to see. A lot of walking but even ground so good for people with disabilities. Some of the areas you needed to step over a raised doorway which could provide some difficulty. Well worth visiting.
"Man, it was really crowd! We were there while Labor Day in China and there were too may students around. It was incredibly crowd, but we manage to see as much as possible. We probably spent 5 hours to go all around the major exhibitions and museums. We had great time with the sea of people. It was the most crowded place I was ever in. Also, amazing scenery in and out, too many photo opportunities, and meantime someone wanted to take a selfie with me, that was the second time in 30-40 minutes. That was the first time my life strangers wanted take selfie with me, I had fun, but I feel sorry for the famous people to be in that situation, you cannot say ""no"" to these polite people:-)"
"once you have finished viewing the tianamen square, you follow the crowds and enter the Forbidden City and the beautiful historical structures. we were of course not permitted to enter the buildings, but the historical structures are extremely well maintained, and worth a visit."
"The palace is the place to see in Beijing. It is a pity that they introduced new barrier in front of the chamber so that you see them less good than before ! Be also careful that there is a limit of 80'000 tickets per day to visit it so better book it in advance or go early morning to buy it.
Expect a really crowded visit as well !"
A must see the place in Beijing at least once in your life. The sheer size of the place is impressive.
"This place should be on the list of every tourist going to Beijing. Not only does it show an elaborate Chinese history, but also the architecture. You get to see how the Emperor and his cohorts used to live."
"A beautiful Palace to wonder around with so much to see. A MUST.
Good to have a guide to explain the buildings etc."
"Walking into each open quad through the ancient buildings gets more amazing as you proceed. The buildings are beautifully preserved. Knowing that you can stand where emperors and empresses have stood is impressive. The garden is lovely, especially in Spring. It is crowded. We had to wait about 1/2 hour for a member of our tour to be found. Stay with your group!"
"Having been to the Forbidden City, the day we chose to go again was miserable and wet. There is little to no English for the international visitors with no seating to rest. With no way to get out of the weather and no buildings open to enter I would advise you choose you visit carefully. The architecture of this period can be found at the summer palace or the temple of heaven so if time is limited I would choose to go there and give this a miss"
It took less than 40 minutes (by car) to get to the palace. You’re dropped off at the exit. Buy a bus ticket (gives park access). Take the shuttle bus to East gate entrance. Allow two to three hours. Amazing. You have to buy additional tickets for some internal buildings. We didn’t do that.
"Amazing place but very crowded, they only let through 80000 people each day so get there early and be prepared to be jostled."
"It’s both breathtaking and eerie to stand in such a rich and culturally beautiful location.
5 stars!!"
"Was on my solo trip, never lonely in China as every where is full of people. Prepare a good shoes to walk this entire huge palace. Good to have a guide with u, the electronic guide machine somehow not quite attentive at some areas.
Maintenance of this palace is quite upset, they could have done it better. With that crowd, pretty much unable to enjoy the view slowly but enough to feel the greatness of Forbidden City."
A trip to Beijing should always include a trip through the Forbidden City. It is an amazing way to learn about the history of China and the many dynasties that make up that history. We paid for the self guided tour in English. It was well worth the money and is put together very nicely so that you can move through the grounds at your own pace.
"It’s very obvious that this is a must-see attraction when you’re in Beijing but it needs some serious love and attention.

What you CAN learn from this visit is how vast, powerful and wealthy the Qing Dynasty was. And that’s about it. The sheer size is very impressive.

After that— you are walking and walking just to get to the other side and exit. At least I was. Each section is very repetitive and visitors are completely barred off from seeing inside any of the buildings. There are a pathetic few that are meagrely deforested which you can view behind dirty, greasy glass. But that’s about it.

I think they should stage a few more exhibits, put on some mock ceremonies to give the buildings some context, and add some multimedia. But that all costs $$$. So for now I think they’ll remain happy just doing what they’re doing: opening the gates, charging a toll and letting you walk through.

Oh and definitely watch The Last Emperor before you go visit!"
Prepare yourself for a walk but mostly are flat surfaces and some stairs which is quite easy to walk. They got a large building in different zones and gardens are beautiful. Amazing place to visit. It will be crowded all day as tourists keep coming in.
"Interesting for its massive size and historical significance. Walls and buildings are very consistent, so there isn’t the variety of architecture that is found in historical European cities. I found it like Mammoth Cave - notable for its size but not as pretty as other smaller caves"
"The palace museum or forbidden city is one of the top attractions people come to China for. It does not disappoint. The complex is huge and you could spend a full day there. However I would recommend 4 hours so you can see most in a leisurely pace. If you are in a hurry, 2 hours is the bare minimum. It is a busy place with a capacity of 80.000 visitors which seems like a lot but tickets go fast. Reserve one in advance and save yourself the time it will take to buy one there and avoid the risk of it being sold out. If you go in the afternoon, like I did, it will be busy but at the end of the day when you walk back to the entrance the museum will be much quieter, giving better opportunities for pictures. Otherwise don't expect any pictures without other people on it. Also don't be afraid to be a little pushy, people will crowd the things to see and otherwise you won't get your turn. Definitely go see the clocks and the treasure room. Finally security is tight, don't bring a lighter or expect to lose it. You can get it back but since you leave through a different gate than when you came in it's a gamble if it's at the right gate and it's a free for all, people just take the lighter they like best. Don't miss this, or you'll regret it. Also there is a park behind the museum with a good view of the entire complex (depending on the smog haze)"
The size on the Forbidden City is very large! The history was interesting and our guide was very informative
"Even our teenage son was blown away by the Forbidden City. Follow the lead on TripAdvisor here and when you walk in go to the left or right, not the center...and you will deal with fewer people but see everything you want/need to."
Didn’t realize how big this place was! It’s like a never ending city. The crowds were massive and unfortunately it is hard to really enjoy it with masses of pushing Chinese and locals around. I’ve seen it and now don’t need to go back.
We entered the forbidden city from the east gate and wale about 1 km to reach the west exit gate.The city has almost 999 small palcess as they treat no 9 was lucky in the good old days.The palce is a symbolick history of the emperpror who did not allow the common people to get in.
"Here you need at least 3-4 hours. I also recommend that you spend some hours reading up a bit of history on this thing. It will give you basic factual foundation. When you get there you can admire the reality of it. If you don’t have grounding history, then it will be hard for you to appreciate the palace and its features. Might even look dull.

Passport needs to be brought as it’s number will be used as your ticket.

The queue for me was just 15 minutes. Maybe I got lucky or maybe it wasn’t the peak of the season.

Slow down on photography and selfies and just absorb the reality of the situation and imagine the history behind it.

Joggers or good shoes, while not essential, will make your life easier. Since the place is huge, walking from one point to another takes uncomfortable amount of time.

Imagine an area made out of many football fields. Imagine on that area there are many different building and museums. This is the palace. To see a museum you need to walk to that particular temple. If you want to see another museum you need to walk that distance to another temple.

Some museums require a small fee of 10y to see. Such as clock and watches museum.

Most temples are closed off and you can’t step inside them. But you can view them from the outside. It’s quiet beautiful and unique.

There are shops and food stalls. If you’re hungry take a bite. I personally stay away from merchandise stalls. As they are there to only make profit. But, it’s nice to have a look without buying things. They do have some beautiful items for sale. In any case, if you want merchandise go to a specialty area of Beijing for that.

Comparing this, as a museum, for example, with de Louvre. Lourve is just supreme over this. One gripe I have is that most things at the palace are spaced so far away. It’s annoying. I don’t want to walk 15 minutes from end to another on empty space.

First time in Beijing then this is essential. Another time, and it’s not."
"Must visit when come to Beijing was said before and I agree. It’s my 3 rd time to visit and still it shocks me how beautiful it is.

Prepare to line up long time and huge crowds even though it would be normal working day.

Time: takes at least 1-3 hours

Security: passport or ID required. Line up like in the airport and identity checked by scanning the passport. Even the metro has volunteers who patrol the surrounding lines for security reasons.

Access: suggest to come from the north entrance- less people.

Beverages: take a bag with drinks

Audio: if you are interested of the history instead of walking there aimlessly and have time- highly suggest to buy the tour"
"I was working whilst in Beijing, but I had some free days, on which I chose two must-see places, the Great Wall and The Forbidden City. Beijing is uber-clean (no litter! no dogs! no chewing gum! no graffiti!) and spacious, so the inevitable queues at such attractions are efficiently managed. Information in every tour guide will tell you that foreign nationals must have their passports with them at all times. You get through several queues at TFC before the one where passports are shown, it amazed me that some Europeans were having to be turned away because they did not have their passports with them. Audio guides are well worth the price, there is so much history, and story, here - it would be such a shame to miss it. It is as amazing as it is billed to be, a wondrous experience. You need to allow 4 - 5 hours to see it thoroughly. The exhibitions of art and jewellery are extraordinary, but packed, and you have to overcome the cultural differences, and like the locals, push your way to the front in order to be able to look into every glass case. Toilets for tourists are there. As is Starbucks! How on earth did they do that?!"
I’ll start by saying I am glad we visited the Forbidden City though if I only had a couple of days in Beijing I’m not sure it is a “must see.” The one thing about it you can’t experience any other way is the vast scale of the complex. It truly is massive. To make your way through the gates you just follow along with the endless crush of humanity. Once you can split off and go either right or left around the huge ‘plazas’ you will find the number of other tourists decreased and then it is a more relaxing experience. For me where it falls short is that it feels separate from living history. Like walking through a re-enactment without the actors. Thar all being Forbidden City is an amazing piece of Chinese history.
still fascinating every time i came. lucky we had someone guided us for an hour (rmb150) and she was very good telling her stories. the place kept looking better and better restored when we returned.
"The Forbidden City is a big must if going to China. Get there early as it gets very busy, stunning buildings and so much history you can have a guide but we just made our way around no problem.
Security is very tight all bags checked no liquids or cigarette lighters or matches allowed.
Lovely statues and buildings, some restoration work is in the process of being carried out, but not a problem"
Pictures in books do not do this place justice. It is a must do location in Beijing. It is busy bordering on manic but at the same time you feel the peace and tranquility. I will never forget our visit here I put it right up there with the Vatican in grandeur it is a special place where you can feel it's history.
"This huge Palace is impressive by its sheer size ( 250 acres ), and age ( 700 years old ) The wooden structures themselves were architecturally plain and rather unimpressive. Currently an empty shell you can only imagine the previous royal life. Our limited time and knowledge of Chinese history restricted our experience. Best to have a guide for navigating the lines, and showing you the highlights."
"This place shows how the previous emperors lived - very expansive and rather lonely place. It is unfortunate that one can only see many parts of the buildings and rooms from the outside. Also, many of the rooms are rather empty - feels kind of like a shell.
But it was interesting to walk around the grounds and check out the different palaces within this huge palace where the different emperors, empress, dowagers, consorts, etc lived."
This is a must go place in Beijing. You could see how grand and huge palace China had five hundred years ago.
"The Forbidden City is pretty amazing- just the size of the place is overwhelming. There is such an interesting story behind the buildings, so much history. We really enjoyed walking around, passing through section after section. It was great having a guide and using the earpiece to hear all about what we were seeing. The museum area is great too. I think it's always busy, but it's well worth a visit."
The Forbidden City is like no other sites you would ever see elsewhere! What a richness in culture and history! Plan to spend more than half you day there and pay for the extra halls that you can visit. Every single one is worth the small fee! Finish your visit by going around the city on the top of the wall.
"if you review this .it says you must buy tickets online before. but its a hassle. website requires local tel No. yes you can but tickets of the door. but this too is a hassle as sometime v long queues .poor signage. so we got our hotel to book for us. may have paid extra rmb20. worth it .
as with all attraction in Beijing .inc buying subway tickets you need your passports. this place is beautiful stunning . you ca,nt visit Beijing without coming here. you can do it in 2 hrs. and just walk through and take photos. but go with a guide or get an audio guide to understand and you will get more out of your experience/ allow over 3 hrs"
"we went to the forbidden city in September and early in the morning and so was also everyone else. It is beautiful and interesting to see all the the different areas. but they need to improve how to inform tourist who doesn't speak Chinese how to get tickets ,we looked for information about tickets around 15 min and then finally found in the corner where you can buy the ticket. When moving around you always need to have your passport with you."
"To get the best from this experience, make sure you have a guide. This place is packed and there is good reason - it's pretty amazing. Almost like taking a step back in time. Your guide will give you interesting information - if you attempt this on your own you will miss it. The food and drink available is reasonable, and the service is good."
"We visited this place a week ago. First thing first you need a passport to get a ticket for this place. Long que at the ticket office is really annoying. Worst of all no where at the door or ticket office mentions that a passport is required. Wasted 45 minutes in the que and then realised that passports are required.
All buildings were cordoned off and we had to look inside the palaces from outside (~10m away). Inside was dark and we could hardly see anything."
"This is a huge complex that you should see if in Beijing, We bought the ticket on the door - not much of a que as most of the locals who do not have tickets use QR codes and everyone else is probably part of a tour. We used the digital guide and took a leisurely tour"
recommending to take the digital guide and spend about 3 hours in the palace. amazing experience! !!
"One of the great treasures of the Beijing, you can't visit without touring the Forbidden City. Home the emporers of long ago, it is now a monument to the past, and considering China's communist 20th Century, remarkable that it stands.
Take time to look around this place, for there is much to see, and is wonderfully laid out with exhibits from many different eras."
"Forbidden City visit , can not be forgotten . This was a really wonderful Experience , when You know the ancient China with the Help of Digital Service , available in English . Only Recommendation is to arrange more Drinking Water Facility for the Tourists , as this is a very big area to Cover by Walk ."
"Interesting place to visit and learn the history. Such a large area to cover, not for poor walkers. City is made of wood, so architecture is not as spectacular as most capital palaces"
"We toured the Forbidden City around mid-March and the weather was cool and comfortable and the crowds were definitely at a minimum. It is so much better to visit when you can truly enjoy the experience. This is a fantastic site and should be seen without fainting from the heat or massive crowds. Also, we did our tour on a weekday, not a weekend."
"The Imperial Palace was impressive for its enormity and unique style. It's a must go-to, obviously, if you are in Beijing for one day, or one week. Spend as much time as you can to absorb it all. I guide book, before you go, would be wise and useful. My wife and I were on a small, guided tour (6 people) with China Tours (or Xi'an ANZ International Travel Service Co., Ltd). Our tour guide, Sunny, was one of the most informative, friendly, and accommodating guide we had in Beijing."
"Top tips. Bring your passport
Go early - tens of thousands of Chinese tourists + some foreigners visit every day.
Avoid weekends if possible, if you have to then it opens at 8.30am - be there !
Don’t follow the groups - explore the sides , pay extra once inside to visit the Clock museum and Treasures ( only 10 RMB each)

On arrival at the City head for the security gates, on the right hand side is a ticket office for foreigners. Take you passport and pay. Your passport number becomes your ticket. Head for the security and your in.
The palace is huge , the big groups march through the middle of the city looking at the main buildings . Take time to explore, allow 2 - 3 hours.

Finally, when you leave at the North gate, cross the road and climb Jingshan hill for great views all across the Forbidden City and all Beijing."
"I was in Beijing on a business trip and went to the Forbidden City at the last minute when my flight home was delayed several hours. The concierge at my hotel bought my ticket for me and sent me the ticket number on my Notes on my iPhone since my We Chat is not working. The site is incredible and huge - palace after palace. However, it was a Saturday and the place was incredibly jammed, especially with Chinese tour groups. People had no problem literally pushing me away if they could see inside a palace or stay with their group. The Imperial Gardens were gorgeous but jammed with people - amazing to see the people climbing on the rocks for selfies right next to the sign that says don't climb on rocks. I'm glad I got to take a quick (2 hour) look at it but next time will come back in a small group tour with a guide and spend more time."
The forbidden city is a must see when in Beijing. The history here is incredible. We visited the Fobidden city with a guide which is the best way to see these attractions and learn about History.
The Forbidden City is a huge complex of spectacular buildings which is a test of visitor stamina in the time taken for anything more than a cursory exploration.
This is the place you should be visiting if your only visiting one attraction in Beijing. The endless amounts of Gates ranging in sizes remind you of life and how life shifts. The audio guide is great at explaining the history of this incredible palace which Makes Buckingham and Versailles seem like a bedroom. You may find yourself standing in one of the halls for an hour pondering how it would feel to live in the palace. The many rooms of Concubines and Eunochs shows you the daily life of the inhabitants of the forbidden city. There is even a cafe and a restaurant! Truly worth exploring for the day
Interesting enjoyed seeing the place that we had heard about. Was there on the 3-day Nina holiday so was lots of people there.
"If staying in Beijing this is a must visit. Extremely crowded but worthwhile. When you enter and approach the entry ticket gates, make sure you have already bought your tickets, which is done by lining up at the ticket windows on the right hand side as you face the main ticket check entry. Your passport will become your ticket."
"Although it involves a lot of walking, it was worth the effort. China has an amazing culture and history."
"I travelled with friends who brought kid and baby (and stroller) on April
Taking subways was convenient. Exit on Tiannanmen East Station was pratically brought us right close to check point (bring your passport)
We did not have change to visit the museum since run out ticket (better order on line).
Easy walking with stroller, toilet is easy to find, some little shop for drinks and snack.
We took west gate exit and had to walk about 1+ km to reach Tiannanmen West station (couldnt find taxi).
I wonder if it will be closer using east exit gate"
"Had a great time visiting Forbidden City just 2 days ago. It was quick & easy to buy tickets in person as most Chinese locals bought online. Only locals can buy online & use WeChat to pay :)

The crowds in Forbidden city is not that bad. They move slowly & not that pushy or shoving. Much better than I had expected. Only saw 1-2 older ppl shoving so I just shove them back like nudging lol.

Easy to find and get in at Tiannamen East station :)"
"An extremely interesting and Historic Palace to visit. It is worth engaging a guide as there is so much history with so much meaning, much of which requires explanation. With ""The Last Emperor"" beforehand to get a sense of life there during the Emperor's time."
"If you have issues with crowds then don't visit the Forbidden city as it is the number one attraction in Beijing. Be prepared to shuffle in unison with many strangers who have no choice but to bump, shove and push their way through the entry gates. If you don't mind this argy bargy, you will thoroughly enjoy the experience of the Forbidden City which is simply magnificent. The Emperors spared no money in creating an inner sanctum that would have impressed anyone who came to pay their respects. I am glad to have made the effort but was also relieved to depart for calmer shores."
Far too many people there and not much to do. Yes the architecture is beautiful but there is only so much of buildings i can take. Bit disappointing for me
"The walking tour of the Forbidden City is interesting as the guide provided so much historical information while we walked. The walk from one end of the city to the other was a little long, but worth the time."
"I was positively surprised by its beauty. The area is huge, with different halls, Chambers etc. It takes you hours if you want to see it all. You can enter/exit both in the north and the south. It's crowded, so try to avoid holidays if possible."
"I realy enjoyed my stay here and found it peaceful and relaxing. Overall, I found the tour guide that we used very accomodating."
"Words cannot describe the wonder and mythical feeling of this place. Extremely busy, but you get lost in the hidden tranquility of the extravagant beauty!"
"Be prepared to walk and be astonished by this historical site. We hired a tour guide, Susan, who explained every building. This really made a difference as we walked away really understanding what we just saw. You can spend hours walking around and seeing everything. At least half a day trip. Bring water and for women bring TP. There are very few Western style toilets in the area."
Honestly it's hard to appreciate the majestic scale and great architecture when you're surrounded by tons of Chinese tourists!! But of course it's a must see when in Beijing i just wish there are more to see inside because it seems like we can only see outside of buildings that all look the same. Because it's soooo big it's too tiring to see everything and I wish to see more of the small buildings on the side of the main palace.
"Hugely impressive architecture on a truly gargantuan scale.

It certainly shouldn't put anyone off visiting this must-see attraction in Beijing but it's worth noting that unlike somewhere such as Windsor Castle which is still a royal residence, many of these grand buildings are now mostly empty shells.

Also, the directions to the ticket office didn't seem to be clearly marked. You go to a booth on the right hand side just before the final security check entrance."
"We are fortunate to visit this historical place in perfect weather, blessed with blue skies.
Very impressive and huge compounds. We went with a guide, she brought us to Qianlong retirement home and we could see artefacts rather close up. Imperial gardens was nicely landscaped.
Worth a visit, but do go with a guide as there are no signs/explanatory notes on what you are looking at."
Visited in April - impressive and amazing to think how life may have been when the place was first built. It was hugely busy but having a guide helped us negotiate the the best views.
"lots of people everywhere.
Lots of security to get through to enter
Was ok but pretty much the same repeated in each section."
"Every person visiting Beijing should take time to see. A step back in centuries of time. Beautiful, inspiring, and leaves one in awe."
"Best approached by Tiananmen West station. Nothing prepared me for how massive this palace and its surroundings are. Built to impress, this colossal palace within a palace and city, within a city is a must-see. We spent the whole day there, and it wasn’t enough. Unlike most tourists who simply walk from south gate to north and exit, we meandered to the north-east side (the Clock, and Imperial Treasures Museums) and surroundings, and to the Imperial Gardens, nine-dragon wall, bought beautiful artwork and Imperial Washi tapes from the museum galleries, ambled along the North wall, west areas, Empress Cixi’s quarters, the Emperor’s are closed to public scrutiny, and walked along the upper walls. We saw the well where a beloved concubine was starved to death because she angered the Empress Dowager. The gardens are magnificent, and all over the place are my rooftop “friends”, the little mythical creatures adorning roof ends. Must return in all seasons, the beauty of some ancient flowering trees is a must see."
"We bought our tickets via a travel agent so when we arrived, we queued in the line for tour group entry. Only had to show our passport for the staff to enter our information, the computer screen confirmed our booking and we went in without a glitch.

The forbidden city was very huge and spacious with many ongoing constructions to maintain the grandiosity of the palace. Lots of panels of maps in English to find your way around the palace grounds.

We spent about 2 hours there, just briefly touring around without reading too much into the details of each palaces. It is very huge and one can easily spend an entire day in there. I am giving this place 5 stars because I love the history of this palace and the government really made much effort for the upkeep of this huge complex. The downside was, we went on a Saturday and the crowd was ridiculous. It was just too many people. Maybe try going on a weekday."
"This was a great experience and one of my favorite parts of Beijing. The place is impressive. Extremely massive and the enormous size is impressive. Every time you feel like you have reached the end or pinnacle it just keeps going. Beautiful detail and history everywhere. The only downside is it’s so crowded, but still go, it’s worth it."
"My husband and I went here as a tour with China Spree. I cant get over the size of this ""city"". Wait until you hear how many concubines and unics the Emperor had; its astonishing. The gardens are breathtaking. Sadly, I accidentally deleted all of my photos from Beijing."
We went on a Wednesday morning and it was still packed. Lots of pushing and bumping that took away from my experience. It is very well preserved but I would have enjoyed this more if there were less people. I would recommend a guide. We went without and maybe it would have been better with a guide. Purchasing a ticket was smooth and easy. There are windows to the right of the opening where you show your passport and purchase a ticket. If you are a student and have a student ID you can get a discount. Probably the most interesting part were all the people wanting to take our picture. That was odd. Maybe a lot of black people don't go to Beijing.....idk lol
"Even from the outside this place is breathtaking, to see the formidable wall that surrounds this ""city"" and to understand the significant roll it played for so long is amazing! Then once inside you are lost, not only in the sheer size and many maze like buildings and walkways but in the lure of your imagination. Thinking you are walking in the footsteps of so many great Chinese emperors. Amazing and breathtaking, walking the top of the wall is a must! In one of the towers you learn about how at one point this place was almost an abandoned relic, but through great perserverence ons man led the way to rebuilding and making this place back into one of the most amazing places on earth."
We spent an afternoon here and it was fairly busy but interesting. We did the audio tour which was nice as it told you what you would be reading on the signs without trying to crowd around them. It was an easy subway ride from the center of the city where we were staying.
Besides the Great Wall this is a must see in Beijing. April is the start of the tourist season and the crowds were light. It was fantastic.
We loved viewing this incredible part of Chinese history. We couldn't believe an emperor would need so many buildings! Be prepared to walk alot! Souvenir shops are plentiful and affordable.
"I couldn’t get enough pictures of this place. This should be your number one spot when visiting Beijing. The grounds are well maintained and the security is well present. The structures are so massive, historical. China prides itself on sharing this sightseeing area to the world."
"We toured the Forbidden City on Christmas Day and luckily for us the sun shone for the entire tour which was very welcome as it got cloudy later and was bitter cold. The protocols of City Life were
very interesting and this is definitely a must see."
"It was okay, not the best place I've visited in Beijing. Too many tourists to take good pictures. The price is not expensive so you can make your way there + discount if you are student"
Once again it was breathtaking to see the splendour and waste that the Emperor and his family lived in.
"I found the forbidden city quite interesting, however, because of its physical size it started to become repetitive and because our guide wanted to instill all of his knowledge on us we spent over two hours here and I'm sure one hour would have been ample."
"Be prepare a one day trip there as it is so huge a place. My visit then was suppose to be a low season but it is still very crowded so I cant image during park seasons. Nice to take a slow walk to slowly explore the area. We reach ard 11+ and left the ard 4+ yet we barely covered half the place. And we are already so tired from the walk.
Truly Majestic and magnificence place to visit!"
Couldn't get in. Sold out by 9 AM on big holiday weekend but outside touring in the area is impressive and immense. You can spend a half day just gawking at the size of everything. Plan a route on a good map or you will waste a lot of time and leg power. Sytart south at the gates and work north to the forbidden city because that's how the security stream flows.
"Historic and popular site in Beijing that everybody goes to. It can be very crowded, so best to go early. Make sure to have your passport. The Palace can be closed on some days without an announcement."
A must visit place when in Beijing. The place is packed with people. It is a pity that we can not enter the palace and can only see the buildings from outside only.
"A must visit place for tourists and locals alike. In recent years security has increased - no lighters, paper, food or drink. Foreigners must show passports, Chinese nationals - local ID. However, check point lines move very quickly. I was in on a cold gloomy day, so crowds were not overwhelming.

Ticket sales are either online or by scanning QR codes at various spots before the entrance - evidence of ever-increasing e-factor in the everyday life in China, including use of electronic payments.

Audio tour guides in two dozen languages are available but I didn't take as I was with a local friend.

The grounds are kept very well. There are constant restoration works, so parts of the grounds are intermittently closed. In about 3 hours I managed to briefly cover about half of the grounds. So for a thorough explanation, likely more than one full day visit is required. At about 5pm all visitors are promptly ushered out. In any event, to avoid excessive fatigue and to maintain the enjoyment of the experience several shorter visits may be better.

The tour path is one-way. Entering from the Tiananmen Square (south side) you exit through the north end. From there there are good 2km+ walk to any of the nearby subway stops. So, for return plan a taxi.

On the north end across the street there is also a famous hilltop belvedere. Naturally Beijing is flat, but tis hill was created from the excavated earth when the Palace was built. At the top you could look over the walls into the grounds (NB: I was told that, as I did not go myself).

Various pavilions in the Palace also have rotating sculpture and other art exhibitions.

Tickets were 60RMB per person, which is very reasonable. Toilet facilities are available and are very clean, though a squatter-style."
"China's most iconic site, first a photo in the Square, then join the crowds and flow through each courtyard of the City."
"Interesting to see, but without a guide you dont get to know the full history behind it and just walk through it. Not too expensive so may as well check it out. Bought tickets on Klook"
"Visited at a time when the crowds were approaching peak capacity, so difficult to enjoy at one's pace, nevertheless very impressive 'city'."
"I understand some people are really interested in this, and if you are interested in Chinese history, this probably is the ""palace' for you. But we just didn't. So it's kind of just crowded and boring. There are so many people it feels like cattle being herded. We managed to score a table and get some noodles on site but that was more memorable than most of the repetitive buildings. If you do like this kind of thing, maybe go full send and hire a guide so they can give some history perspective. Also, you can buy tickets online ahead of time on Kook app so you can avoid the lines. We went at noon on Sunday and there was no line. And no offense meant, this is a personal preference, but we suspected we wouldn't love it and we were right, you might enjoy going to the park at the North end instead and look at it without walking through it."
"We went there not really expecting the vast amount of buildings that make up the forbidden city. This was an amazing place to visit.
Take plenty of time to go around.
Ignore the tour guides at the front.
You don’t need an online ticket you can get them there. Take your passport or you won’t be allowed in. In fact carry your passport with you at all times in Beijing as you’ll be asked for it all the time.
We got headphones for 40¥ each. Well worth it.
Enjoy!"
"Visiting the forbidden city is a real step back into ancient Chinese history. If you’ve seen the film The Last Emperor you can immerse yourself into those dark distant times.
All though it is a very busy tourist attraction it is large enough for you to find quiet areas where you can imagine life in those times. Historical artifices and carvings, giant doors Allie ways and gardens. All an amazing insight into times gone by.
A must on any visit to Beijing or even China"
"I saw this as a part of a tour. I'm glad I did as the tour guide explained what each building was, the meaning of the art, significance of lions and dragons, etc. Bathroom is at the very end and you're not allowed to move backwards once you go forwards on the grounds so don't drink too much prior to visiting."
This is a great place to experience the great leaders of the past from China. An amazing place that was built and maintained to preserve the Chinese culture. You will need to purchase a ticket the day before. You can either go in the morning or the afternoon. The place closes at 3:30 so have a ride arranged to pick you up as it is hard to find a ride outside the fences.
"It is huge and very intiminating! We spend over 3 hours there on our own. Be prepared for a lot of tourists. We didn't enter thru the main entrance, instead we went thru one of the side doors so it was easy. Ticket office was right there and it was a short line to buy the tickets. Definately buy a ticket to the Hall of Clocks and Watches. Best time to go is spring or fall during off season. Can't imagine going there in summer."
We spent a few hours walked through The Forbidden City- Palace Museum and saw the awesome architectures in each courtyard of the palace . It was indeed impressive 👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼
"An incredible history dating back to emperors of time. There 999 and a half rooms within the place as they say God has 1000 rooms and the emperors can not be better than God. You need quite a while to discover the whole area, so make sure you allow time to explore."
"An enormous campus chock full of historic buildings. We were a handful of 6 non-Chinese tourists in a sea of large Chinese tourist groups all eager to see this historic site. The excitement is palatable. Our guide was well equipped to educate us on the buildings, construction and use throughout the ages. A ‘must see’ site. Our attention span is on the shorter side so we really appreciated an abbreviated version of a full blown tour. We were given the main highlights and significant facts to keep it interesting and we stayed engaged. Definitely recommend."
"We were surprised by the size of this place. It was much larger and took longer to visit than we had expected. It's a popular spot, so be prepared for crowds."
Facinating place to vist although a lot of walking is involved and it can get quite busy. Easy to navigate through the various levels.
"There is so much already written about this place, so here are just a couple of tips. Besides the obvious stuff like wear comfortable shoes because of all the walking, here are some more useful tips for those who travel without a guide: 1. When you take the metro it will let you out at a very unassuming station. Once above ground you may look around like 'am i in the right place?' You are. Behind the small blind of trees you will see both Tian 'an men and the Palace (Forbidden City). 2. You will get in the long line that has not signage. It is a mandatory line to go through a security checkpoint. Have your passport ready to show. 3. After the checkpoint you need to go BELOW GROUND again. This is a tunnel system that will take you to the square side of the boulevard or the palace side. It is designed to move large groups across the road safely. It's genius. Stop complaining. You haven't even starting walking yet.
4. The square is massive and a fun place to take selfies and people watch. As always, do your research about who you CANNOT photograph and be respectful. This is also the resting place of their former leader. 5. When you go to the palace side you will walk through three major 'gates'. They are impressive and beautiful. Guess what, you aren't inside yet. Just follow the crowds and you will finally see an area where people are getting on lines. These lines are for tour groups and people who already hold tickets. If you are a 'waiguoren' (foreigner) and you need to purchase a ticket there are NO signs telling you where to do this. Don't panic. And don't get on the lines. You will only waste time and irritate everybody behind you. As you are looking at the lines feeling sorry for yourself, turn and look 90 degrees over your right shoulder. There you will see a small unassuming little building with a window. Again, there are no signs beckoning you... walk over. You will see a nice young lady in there that will ask for your passport and you pay her for your ticket. It's that easy. Now get on those crazy looking lines! 6. If you enter from the North Gate of the palace I believe there is a ticket office there too but it's a bit different. You are no where near the Tian 'an men Square (it's clear on the other side of the palace grounds). And if you buy a ticket here I believe you are charged for the Palace and the Gardens across the street. If you were planning on doing both, then that's awesome, have a blast. But if you were skipping the garden because you are out of shape and can't handle more than the square and the palace you don't want to buy tickets at the North Gate. You can't drop the cost of the garden at that spot. It's all or nothing.
p.s. Tian 'an men Square doesn't cost anything to see.
Have fun!"
"We were there on a Saturday, and it was so crowded. If I have to redo our trip again, I would definitely visit the palace on weekdays. Just can't imagine what the crowd will be like during peak season. Anyway, the palace is absolutely amazing, even with all the crowds. Definitely one of the highlights of our trip."
"Traveling with a teen and tween, they were at first resistant to another “bunch of old buildings that all look the same.”

However, the audio guide made all of the difference. They really enjoyed hearing the stories and learning about each site. It was the springboard for several interesting conversations.

We spent the entire morning into the very early afternoon. By then the heat and the crowds had done us in. While it is off season, tomorrow is the Day of Weeping, a National Holliday. I suspect people started early. This is the busiest site we have been too.

Honestly, I could not imagine battling summer time crowds and the heat and still enjoying it. Spring is the way to go.

Palace gift shops are pretty good.

Palace restaurant was very bland but no worse than other museum foos based upon price and quality.

Unlike the Summer Palace, there are not vendors everywhere, which is nice. OTOH, bring your own water.

The site is technically wheelchair friendly but I would hate to have to navigate it in a chair and there are sites where if you can’t walk a few steps, you will never get in.

We did not but the extra sites ticket. If we had the day would have been too long for my crew.

You could not exit from Meridian Gate. It’s a long walk around. Avail yourself of the little shuttle at each gate. For only 2 RMB it’s money well spent."
"This site is so huge that it can get overwhelming very quickly. Even in the off-season, it was very crowded, so it was difficult to actually see anything but the outsides of the buildings. The gardens are very nice, and I wish we could have spent more time there."
"Well worth visiting, it is so much larger than I expected. there are a lot of steps and uneven ground - so wear appropriate footwear.
Be prepared to wait to look into many building ( and to push forward to see) as they are not accessible to the public.
There is so much to see you need to spend a good amount of time there and also when you visit as it is busy."
"It is a huge palace spread over a very large area. The historical significance, splendour and maintenance are excellent. Better come prepared with all the research on what you are going to see, and its significance. You need at least 3 hours to even cover the main areas of this palace, and a full day if you are a history enthusiast. You need to walk a lot. The caveats are: (i) the main areas where the emperors' rooms/offices are located are still 'forbidden' for tourists. They can not go inside, and can only have a glimpse from outside, and that too from an angle; and (ii) you need to buy tickets online from Chinese language websites, which is not possible for foreigners, and you have to pay a commission to a travel agent in the hotel to do that for you."
"The buildings, statues and the grounds are amazing. Everything there has historic significance. Also, very crowded, so pick your time to visit carefully."
"Wow - just amazing.

The city is large with several courtyards & you get an insight into how the Emperors and Empresses of the past used to live.

Our guide provided us with a lot of information about the different rooms and areas of the city and we didn’t even go near the 8700 bedrooms that still exist.

Make sure you have a guide who knows the city & it’s history- it’s worth it!"
This place is vast so I would recommend getting there early and spending the day there as there is so much to see. Get your tickets at the gate but you will need to bring your passports but it’s cheap. It’s got lots of information boards around you can also do an audio tour.
"It will cost you half a day,it's huge and I suggest you find a guide,otherwise you're going for nothing!Forbidden City is closed on Mondays,try to avoid the peak tourist season,After visiting The Forbidden City,the best choice is continue visiting the jingshan park,where you can have a whole view of Forbidden City !"
"If you are ever in Beijing, you would not want to miss this. This is a MUST visit. The largest palace in the world. Magnificent in every sense. The weather was cold when I visited which actually made it more pleasant to walk around. I'd imagine in the summer months one best bring an umbrella or cap/ hat sunglasses along as a lot of the space is open air under the sun.

It is crazy crowded with 1-2 million visitors a month. LOTS of local inland China tourists who shove and push their way through the entry gate like they were fighting for their lives. Cultural shock."
We visited the Forbidden City with a day trip and it was amazing but next time we will book entrance tickets ourselves and go on our own to have more time to explore
"We had fun exploring this massive and interesting structure. Our daughter liked running around and admiring the amazing attention to details as animal shapes were made of small stones in the side walks and the size is simply amazing.

We read a bit before we traveled to engage the imagination of our daughter in this must see site. The hotel also provided some information which was helpful. Since there were so many little things to see and take in we found it more engaging for our daughter than the Great Wall."
Sadly compared with the other treasures of Chins the Forbidden City is rather disappointing and ordinary. The red colours of the buildings are dull and do not have the brightness of say the royal palaces of Thailand. It is a must see of any visit to China but it is the other sites of China which will overwhelm you.
"Definitely don't visit Beijing without wandering through the Forbidden City, but our visit experience was somewhat lesser than we expected due to how crowded it was (even though on a Wednesday March morning, not on a holiday). The number of tour groups and crowds made it difficult at times to even get close to the buildings to look inside. The Emperor's Garden near the exit was the most scenic spot. Upon exiting, go north to the park across the street and climb the tower there for an impressive view of the Forbidden City and surrounding area."
An incredible place to visit. To see some of this venue you need to be able to walk about 8-10K. The painted under the eves is incredible. A lovely experience. Have a guide with you to explain the history.
The history and sheer size of the palace were amazing however it was hard to enjoy because it was so crowded. We arrived on a Tuesday at opening a d still encountered extremely long lines for security check points. Places like the clock museum and walking through the center of the palace we were literally shoulder to shoulder with other tourists. It might be better to go closer to closing and risk being rushed.
"Awesome--but go with Chinese friends, a tour or have the tax or car service drop you off at the gate. Walking from the hotel is likely to lead to being lost. Prepare for walking several miles within--stay to the center if time is short. Buy tickets at hotel with use of foreign passport. Bring things to drink and eat. Note--bags are inspected at entrance. Don't carry much--go on a sunny and warm day--much exposure outside. Do not take rickshaw rides unless you bargain and have a set price before going or leaving the palace. Small food shops outside are good. Beware of hotel advice that it is within walking distance--not good when combined with all the walking within. Incredible experience--like one palace within another--like Japanese Kokeshi dolls--you would do well to look up this site on wikipedia and spending time learning about dynasties, their differences, and the different emperors--makes the experience much deeper."
"Quite impressive! A very large space with good views of the various houses. Snow made walking a little cumbersome in February, but a great visit nonetheless."
Lovely complex of buildings with plenty to see. You can explore the walls and go in many of the buildings. Lots of lovely buildings on the East side of the complex.
Spent the afternoon there and there’s a lot to see. Very beautiful gates and architecture. A definite highlight of the trip.
"Fun and totally doable with kids!!

We visited the forbidden city with our 2 young kids - 3 and 5 year old! They loved it! Enjoyed going in and out the different palaces, chasing each other around and jumping off the stairs!

Biggest tip I can give parents with young ones- take a stroller! We did and did not regret it. There is no way we could have made it as far as we did, without our strollers! Also carry lots of snacks- all the activity got them real hungry, and we ended up having ‘mini picnics’ a few times through the forbidden city!"
I stayed 5 to 6 hours. You need this time without break if you desire a complete visit. By you ticket on the web the day before. The audio guide is bought inside. By a ticket for the morning then you can stay all the day. If afternoon ticket you cannot enter before 12:30. Generally it's not possible to enter inside the building but I'm not sure that is the most important. The atmosphere with architecture is enough to feel in the history. The garden is very nice. Don't forget the tresorus and to walk on the wall to have a good view. Exit is by the east door and entrance by the South. Don't forget your passport it's the key to enter (You give the reference when you by the ticket).
"While well worth a visit, the Tianmen Square and Forbidden City precinct gets hugely busy on public holidays and Saturdays (and perhaps Sundays but not sure). We went on a Saturday and I’d say that there were more than 100,000 visitors there. Lots of shoving and pushing and loud voices. The attendants did a pretty good job keeping dveryond in line but given the numbers it was a tough ask."
So many people but once you get used to the crowds was very enjoyable. Will return here in the very near future
"The Forbidden city is a must-see but brace yourself for a decent amount of walking. By the end we had 30,000 steps, granted we also did Tiananmen Square the same day.

It is a really busy place full of Chinese tourists from other parts of the country but all the palaces and statues inside are fascinating."
"The history of the forbidden city has a long and interesting emperor's Chinese history.
It was really big area and we thought it would never stop. Don't forget your passports for coming in there."
"This is a beautiful ""mini city"" within the secure walls - nicely laid out for the Kings of the yesteryear. Details in the construction and artworks spread around defies the logic - and one wonders the dedication of the artisans of those times to have been able to create these wonderful pcs of art with the cultural heritage spread all over this place.
This is one ""not-to-miss"" spot"
"This is a place you must visit when you will be in Beijing, it is the greatest! At least I think like that!

From April to October , it is the busy season, you will pay a little bit more for the tickets, I think 60rmb, in the weak season only 40rmb! This pics I took few days ago, I was so lucky to have this wonderful weather, and all the pics I made is so beautiful !

I have been to here so many times as I am living in Beijing, each time a friend visit they wanted to come here!

Just I don’t like when there are so many people , I enjoy more peaceful . So it is more nice when you will go weak season and during the weekdays!"
You need a whole day to do justice to this magnificent site. The Forbidden City is the former Chinese imperial palace from the Ming dynasty to the end of the Qing dynasty (1420 to 1912). It covers an area of over 72 hectares with approx 980 buildings - most of which you can only see from the outside. There are hidden gems around every corner. The entrance and exit are at opposite ends of the site so once in you have to go through the entire complex to exit. Bathrooms are located before the entrance and just before the exit so plan ahead.
"What a stunning place!! I felt like on a movie set!
November till March is my preferred time to go. It’s preseason and it’s not so crowded. Try to go in the afternoon about 2 to 3 hours before they close to avoid the heavy crowds. Get your tickets in advance online, so you don’t have to stand in line. You need your passport to register."
What an amazing place! An absolute must if you are in Beijing. Every building and courtyard is a revelation
"We visited the forbidden city on a morning after breakfast, as we knew crowds would quickly fill in the grounds where the attraction is located.
Despite arriving kinda early, there were already many people queuing to purchase the tickets, but we managed to get ours and started our visit.
We saw an exhibition which was really interesting, with beautiful paintings, nice dresses from the past and interesting insights about the past.
At times the crowds made the visit quite annoying, but overall it was an interesting visit to one of the most famous attractions in the world."
"The history of this place simply overwhelms me. If you are familiar with the history of Ming or Qing Dynasty, you will be awed like me to see all those places that you have heard so much about. This place is not huge, but there are designated routes you need to walk along in order to travel between the different palaces. The Forbidden City also houses Chinese artefacts in various buildings/palaces at the left and right side of the main North-South route. The entrance ticket into the Forbidden City costs CNY 40 per adult, and CNY 20 per senior citizens, you will need to pay again if you wish to visit the key museums which houses the antique watches and jewelries in the Forbidden City.

There is plenty to see but you will be able to complete it with good planning if you know what you want to see and where you want to go. Look up the recommended tour routes of the Forbidden City online and select one that best fits your interest. Start early at 830am if you can, If you can afford it, hire an english speaking guide at the window next to the one renting the audio guide. A guide cost around CNY 200 for two hours and can bring you along the route of your interest. As most write up boards are in Chinese, the guide will be able to explain the history of each item or place to you.

Whatever you do, please do not get the audio guide - An english language audio guide is more expensive than the chinese language version. More importantly, the guide looks better than it works. It is GPS activated and will tell you about an attraction when it detects that you are near. The problem is, it does not detect your position well, and the audio guide will run out of battery when it tries to run a story. And in the rare time that it works, the same story will keep repeating as long as you stay at the site. There are a few canteens at this place where you can grab lunch and rest. However, if you are rushing to see everything, just bring plenty of water and biscults. You can reward yourself with a good meal after seeing everything at the Forbidden City."
"We couldn't actually get in on this visit as all tickets at the ticket office had been sold out. Tickets were still available on the website which is why you'll see crowds of people standing around the scannable QR codes. However without a Chinese mobile number we were unable to use the site. (Also it's in Chinese only and probably only accepts payment by Wechat, etc.)

An alternative for those who can't get in is to climb the hill in Jingshan Park just to the north of the Forbidden City from where you get a great view over it and over the whole of Beijing."
"The Forbidden City Also know officially as the Imperial Place Museum, was originally constructed by the third Emperor of the Ming Dynasty, Emperor Yong Le, where 24 emperors once lived in succession. Its not until you walk through the grounds that you get to feel the vastness and size of the City. Its Huge! Its amazing to see the building and constructions that were built so long ago! Its simply a must see whilst in China!"
"It is very big. You will see a lot of similar roofs one after the other. Most of the buildings you will only see from the outside, though. We went there on a Sunday, and the place was full of people, and just watching people taking pictures of themselves and their companions was just about as amusing as admiring the spectacular buildings :-)

Do remember to bring a passport or some sort of an ID. I didn't, but luckily I had a picture of my driver's license on my phone and that was sort of acceptable."
"Located across from Tiananmen Square, you could easily spend a couple of days taking it all in. Arrive early to ensure you are granted a ticket since they limit the amount of visitors daily. Wear comfortable shoes. The compound is huge!"
"If you could walk into at least 5 structures or so - congratulations! We did that in winter (-17deg) and could only reach the Hall of Supreme Harmony.

But what we did see was so jaw dropping that maybe it was enough awesomeness for a day - and there were still more than 900 buildings to go!

Spring is the best time to visit, I think. During winter, the place looked kinda sad. But still there were hundreds of tourists braving the cold. Every thing about the Forbidden City is grand - there wasn't anything that I could describe as ordinary. Even the red doors were works of art - they were huge, with giant ""nails"" in neat 9 by 9 rows. Our guide said that only the Emperor could use the number 9 as it was reserved for him. Saw a replica of these doors in Little Buddha, the resto owned by the same family that founded Eng Bee Tin in Binondo. It was fun discovering it there - we shouldn't have gone all the way to Beijing as we already had something similar in nearby Binondo ;).

Chinese art and architecture are in full display here - the ancient Chinese were so creative and patient to be able to build such a Palace Complex. I can't fathom the organization and supervision needed for thousands of workers that made this place a reality. Aren't we really lucky that we have the Forbidden City to experience? Maintaining such a place must be really expensive and the minimal entrance fee is surely not enough to cover the expense. So kudos to the officials that manage this place - thank you for sharing this treasure to the rest of the world!"
"I follow the route from South entrance to North for exit.

Load of people are around, I think that why there are a big field or square in front of the first building Tai Wo Hall.

Do check out the Treasures Collection hall and the clock antique masterpiece exhibition hall from different nations such as British and France.

I bring with me some lunch as I planned for 6 hours exploring there.

Missed the areas or houses where emperor wife, mistress staying."
"It took me a bit an hour to get in the bloody place at 11am or so on a Saturday morning, then I spent an hour inside. It’s an impressive side and I can imagine it’d been quite imposing back in the day. I saw a couple of the rooms, eternal tranquility and happiness forever or something like that. Struggled to relate to it. Big picture of this fella Mao on the wall and, for my money, communism has achieved the same here as in Cuba and Russia in holding back the people. Shame."
"I was in Beijing for business, the people I was visiting took me to the forbidden city.

We didn’t have enough time to go through the place so we did a quick walk. The please it’s beautiful, if you are interested in Chinese culture I recommend that you plan enough time ( we only had a couple of hours).
Once you are there get a tour or an audio tour. Otherwise every building will look the same to you and will not know the difference."
"just an amazing visit, such history and such beauty Could have spent a lot longer wandering and exploring but such is the trade off on visiting on your own, or visiting with a tour group"
"In the midst of such an industrious area, seeing the forbidden city was incredibly breathtaking. The architecture is stunning and the space is vast, all the art is detailed. I highly highly highly recommend a tour guide though because it all becomes so much more meaningful when you understand the history behind it all. I also recommend paying the 5¥ to go up the stairs and see the forbidden city and the rest of Beijing from above!"
"Forbidden City is one of the major attractions in Beijing China. I find it a good place for picture taking but my recommendation is to go to the side areas and not the center. Center area is too crowded. The side areas have less people but the same quality of temple and background as the center area. The line is very long when we went there so be sure to pack a lot of patience within yourself.

Our tour guide also reminded us to take care of our belongings. never leave your bag, phone etc when busy taking pictures as there are instances that these can be stolen without you noticing. Please be alert in all the places that you will go to in China.

."
"A good attraction if interested in Chinese culture & worth doing.

Lots a people attending but as the Palace grounds are so big plenty of room to move about. Be prepared to walk a lot so take comfy shoes."
"Last month,I visited the Forbidden City.I went there in the morning so we could enjoy the beautiful view which snow covered the huge palace which is red and yellow.We could see things such as golden dragen and birds in the palace.At the back of the palace,there were many old trees that had the age of 450 years.Special stones were also put in the garden.Foods were also provided."
obviously need to see this when in Beijing. However wasn't really my thing. Once you had seen one of the buildings all the rest was exactly the same. Huge place with so many people about and I visited off season. No point taking pictures as will have so many people in them.
"It's definitely not to be missed. Great place and architecture. Nice for photo ops. There was a store that allows children to dress up as emperor or empress. Despite of being expensive 200cny per picture, we got it for a souvenir."
Beautiful and so much history. I recommend booking with a tour because you get to by pass lines and you will get the history of the place. Book with Tours By Jessie. You could easily spend an entire day here and take some incredible pictures.
"Massively busy with approximately 80,000 people visiting per day. It’s very well organised so doesn’t feel oppressive.. it’s a vast area so crowds can fit. Men with wheelchairs are available to push the less able around for a fee, no I don’t know how much. We were all ages in the group so some did use this facility successfully. Found Chinese people generally friendly and polite towards th’Olds’.
Fantastic place to visit and so rich in history, great gift shop at the end"
"The FC is huge and there is a lot to see. To walk from the north gate to the South Gate will take you two hours if you don’t stop. The north gate has the majority of the buildings and palaces. The South Gate has the gardens and small temples. You could easily spend a day here to see everything. Drinks and snacks are aplenty, but there’s only one restaurant and it’s just inside the north gate. It’s a beautiful place and worth seeing."
"This is a very big palace really big takes hors to walk and see everything at times boring but a must to see just for the size of a palace that a person can build for another, learn about life here in its day with a tour history involving the concubine and the workers and family a must to even just look at."
"There are a number of ways to see the forbbiden city, if you come in a group the guides might rush things a bit, so I would recommend coming back to view the palace at your own speed."
"We thought we would breeze through this City in a hour or so. Boy, were me wrong. Make sure you are wearing a good pair of walking shoes. We went on a cold day in December. That worked out well, because the croud was very limited. Also, buy the tickets before arrival, and you will save a lot of time."
The for forbidden city was very exciting to experience while in Beijing China. Jimmy was our guide and he did a tremendous job. Without him we would have no clue how to get in and out of the city
Medium walk from New World Hotel to Tinanamen Square across street from Forgidden City. Easy to do on your own but Zoe was our guide and she was great.
Great experience! Be aware of security check when entering Tian’anmen Square and long lines with people entering the square and the Forbidden City. Plan to go there early mornings.
"Beautiful place, the architecture and history of this location was magnificent. If you have trouble walking and climbing stairs this might be difficult for you. But worth it."
As we were part of a group we got through the lines quite easily but be prepared for a bag search and body scan. We thought it was extremely busy but evidently it was a quiet day compared to the weekend. The area is so huge that once you are past the gates you can take a photo without anybody else in it! Take snacks with you as it takes a couple of hours to stroll through and soak it all in
"My visit for forbidden city was OK. It was really crowded and really was just seeing nice historical Chinese architecture. We got an audio tour guide which was nice but probably not needed. We only really needed about 2 hours to visit from front to end but we were also not
Trying to explore to much. It was cool but I personally wouldn’t go back."
"Palace museum is located in Chang'an street,DongCheng district,Beijing.There have 6 palace so it take a long time,if you want go thought at once.I like Royal Garden best, because there are many beautiful plants there,I suggest to have a look.If you fell hungry I suggest you go to the north gate,there have a lot of snackes,there are tast very good.
At last never bring the pet in,this is prohibited.That all my review,have a nice trip and good luck!"
"this is a very historical place,it doesnt look that big when you enter, but we got a surprise at how big it is.mostly everything is in its original state so bear this in mind as some of the cobble stones are worn away and there are holes in places, if you have internet read up on the history a little so you have an idea what its about."
"Location:DongCheng Street,No.4 in Beijing Tickets:60 RMB for adults,20 RMB for kids . Time:8:30a.m-5:00p.m Brief introduction:It was founded during Ming and Qing dynasty.It faces to Tiananmen,its back is Jing mountain,its east is WangFu Jing street and the west is ZhongNanhai.The palace is also called Forbbiden City.There were 24 emperors living in it.It situated at the heart of Beijing.Now,there are more anf more commercials around the Palace museum,you can see many hotels ,restaurants and shopping malls.But I like the hot pot best which it is said that it is CiXi's favourite,too.We can not only learn history but modern art in Palace museum.Would you like to try?"
"This is a must see! It is well preserved and a great sight. Vibrant colors and a lot of walking. The grounds are vast, but the history is well preserved and worth visiting."
"So glad we saw this during our tour of the Forbidden City. You have to pay to get in, but it's well worth it."
"I only had a spare morning in Beijing, so I arranged a tour to the Forbidden City. The city is vast and would take 2-3 trips to see it all, but you can certainly see the main central part of the complex in 3 hours.

I would really recommend a guide to show you around. This stops you being hassled (ripped off) at the gate by chancers - plus the history of the city is fascinating as are the insights into ancient Chinese culture which are expressed through the architecture.

Two other pieces of advice - firstly you have to buy a ticket before you enter the city and this has to be done in advance, as there is a daily limit of 80,000 visitors per day. Your confirmation ID is your passport number, so you need your passport to get in. I tried doing this on line and after an hour I gave up as the website is in Chinese and of course Google does not work in China - it was really clunky. The best thing to do is ask the concierge at your hotel to make the booking. It took my guy only a few minutes and the cost is very inexpensive.

Secondly, the tour ends at the back (north) end of the complex where there are NO taxis when you exit, with a very long walk back to the entrance. So if you can book a car somehow with your guide, I would recommend that. sensible flat shoes are a must."
"My son and I have felt like we walked into an Epcot set since arriving in China. And that feeling couldn’t have been stronger than at the Forbidden City. The size of the city is amazing. The architecture and paintings are gorgeous. Each time you think you’re just walking through an arch you end up in another wonderful courtyard. Truly an adventure and spot not to miss. I would recommend going earlier than we did (around 10:30am). We waited in a very very long crowd for security. On our way back to the hotel in the evening, we walked along the outside of the city walls along the moat. That, too, is highly recommended. We saw a lot of the army and police doing drills, which was interesting. And it was a very beautiful way home."
"As an architect, there was a lot of meaning to this unique architectural marvel. The striking secrets behind such planning - with military and Feng Shui rules, the structural genius and the artistic touches of luxury all blend in to tell a tale of what was once - a Glory.

What struck me most was the endless stories that make up the very long history.

I mean, 15 layers of floor cobble stones tightly laid by gravity to ensure that no intruders can ever crawl beneath the palace and 'pop-up' as assasins !!

It took 14 years to build it. Yet it took 20 years to renovate it !

No glue nor nails were used in any of the interlocking wood structures... Hundreds of years already!

Over the hundreds of years, the various dynasties and moods we learn have engrained a human saga in every corner.

Personally, my perception of China and the Chinese has forever changed following this trip."
"The Forbidden City - Palace Museum was incredible.Make sure you have your passport or you won't get in. I learned that the hard way when I had to leave after waiting in a huge line and go backs to my hostel, and the travel all the way back and wait in line AGAIN. The palace is beautiful and there is plenty of English to read so I could still appreciate what was around me. The only downside was how crowded it was. I mean PACKED! Which unfortunately took away from the experience a bit, but I'm still very glad I went. The Forbidden City has been on my bucket left for years."
"If your aim is just to visit the museum and don’t mind skipping 天安门, you may save half an hour or more by entering from 东华门 on the east. In this way, you would skip the tight security check at 天安门 and proceed straight to 午门 where the admission is located.

Depending on the daily quota, you may also walk-in to purchase your entry ticket at the manned counters on the east or by scanning the QR code if you have WeChat Pay. A safer method would be to purchase a ticket online. I bought mine a day earlier from Trip.com app.

Do allow at least half a day or a full day if you are interested in the history of the place. I could not finish the place within the day. I would recommend renting an audio guide for a greater understanding of the history of the museum and purposes of the various monuments and objects. The charges are RMB20 for the Mandarin version and RMB40 for the English.

There are a number of souvenirs shops inside the museum, and some of the prices differ for the same item. Food and drinks are not an issue as there are cafes and restaurants.

Upon exiting the museum from the North, you may consider crossing the road to 景山公园 for an aerial view of the museum. There is a admission charge of RMB2, and a tiring climb up the small hill. For the history buff, this park is also the place where the last emperor of the Ming Dynasty commit suicide by hanging on a tree. The location is by the east of the park entrance, but the original tree is no longer there."
"The weather was gorgeous
It’s better to take a cab to go.
What a place .. full of history and Art
We were amaze.. so beautiful
Do not hesitate to spend almost 7 hours minimum if you have like us only one day here.
So many things to see and to visit
We took a private guide Jane who was absolutely Wonderful to explain all of the huge history of this place.
A place to remember ..!!!"
"Stop! Stop! Stop! Save your not using a tour company! Don't fall for the touts or tour desk in your hotel. Take a taxi, bus, and walk right through the main gate on your own or with your group. Fyi, you cannot get dropped off directly in front of the complex. The street is too busy and security measures are in place. You will need to get dropped off one block to the east or west.
Upon passing through the main gate, the first tickets windows/ building are only for access to the top the main gate where Chairman Mao declared China a nation. Nothing special and something to be skipped. Keep walking, and then walk some more. Eventually you will see the ticket windows for access to the main ""museum"". Some ticket agents speak English and some do not. Pay extra for the audio tour, and yes, it does come in English.

Most signs are in Chinese throughout the complex, although a few are in English. An alternative is to hire one of the many locals that hang out around the ticket booths. Some of them have decent English and make for good guides. The going price is about $30 USD. They usually begin around $100. Talk them down!

The palace complex will take several hours of walking through courtyards, up steps, through museum displays, around gardens, etc. It is a big place. There are many areas to discover that are off the beaten path and are not crowded. The emperor's main throne room and his bedroom are the most popular and busy. Time your visit inside them between the large tour groups with the colored flags and you will have a better experience.

Pay special attention to explore the west side of the palace complex around the ""harem/concubine"" quarters. Many times courtyard doors not usually left open for the public can be accessible. If you are lucky, access to a large tunnel system underneath the complex can be found here. It is part of the Underground City complex that was dug in the 1950's-1960's (In effect, a bomb shelter for Beijing's elite)

Good luck! Oh, also a neat place to be at 4:30 is in front of the main gate. The national army honor guard marches out as traffic is stopped. Their formation crosses over to Tiananmen Square where they take down the national flag. That is very cool to see!"
The Forbidden City was a great place to see and learn about the culture. There is a lot of walking so make sure to wear comfortable shoes. We were there all day and still were not able to see the entire place. Would definitely recommend.
It was a nice experience even when no one speaks English at all and the signs of whats it’s show are only in Chinese! Better get and app to translate
"I booked 2 tickets online via trip advisor. The tickets were paid and confirmed. However, when we arrived at the gate, the info (passport info) is not found. We ended up have to repurchase the tickets.

The tour operator ""Lily's Tour Company"" can be reached, but the attitude was horrible and they can't find our booking reference. The manager at the forbidden city ticket validation gate said this happens 3-5 times on a daily basis. The tour operator will miss entering customer booking from time to time. They also charge a premium for advance booking.

If you have foreign passport, buy at the gate is the safest choice. The operators can't be trusted."
The designs of the buildings and objects within were very beautiful. It gives an insight into the opulence that the Ming emporers were afforded.
"What a difference a day wakes! My classmates and I went to the Palace Museum yesterday. It was sunny and hot. The Palace Museum was big about 72000 square meters. There were many visitors there. We were all exciting because the King and the Queen lived there before. It was built in Ming Dynasty. And Ming and Qing emperors lived there. There are a lot of beautiful and valuable treasure in the glass. First, we went to Taihe Palace that was very grand. The tour guide said that it was the king’s working place. There was a big golden chair which was belonged to the kings. Second, we went to Behind Palace that was beautiful and there are bridges, trees, flowers and many palaces. Third, we went to Cining Place where the king’s mothers lived. It was quiet there. If you want to visit the Summer Palace, you have to go there early because there are many people to visit everyday. What a good day!"
"The Forbidden City is must when visiting Beijing. Because it's a really amazing historical place .

The Forbidden City was the emperors' residence. And there are many documents in it. Everyone of them is priceless. Although it is very interesting, the traffic is not very convenient. Because there is no parking lots around it. You should go there by subway or on foot. If you want to go to the Forbidden City, you must book tickets on internet, because there no tickets are sold underline. And remember! Don't visit the Forbidden City in the Spring Festival or the National day, because it is so crowd.

There many interesting details in the Forbidden City, you can search some information about the Forbidden City on internet in advance. At last hope you have a good time."
"Last vacation,I went to Beijing with my family.It's a interesting trip.I saw a lot of great building,such as the Tian'anmen Square and the great wall.But the best place I think is the Palace Museum.The Palace Museum was built from the Ming dyansty until the Qing dyansty.There are many cultural relics in the Palace Museum,I visited Imperial Household Department and Hall of Supreme Harmony.You can took number 5 bus to Quanjude to ate delicious Peking duck,it's famous in China.I hope you can take my advise.Have a nice trip!"
"February 19, 2019 ,I came to the Forbidden City with my family.The the Imperial Palace of Beijing is the imperial palace of the two dynasties in Ming and Qing Dynasties, formerly known as the Forbidden City. It is located in the center of Beijing's central axis, and is the cream of ancient Chinese palace architecture. Beijing Palace Museum is centered on three main halls, covering an area of 720,000 square meters, with a construction area of about 150,000 square meters. It has more than 70 palaces and more than 9,000 houses. It is one of the largest and most complete ancient wooden structures in the world.When I entered the Forbidden City, I felt the old and mysterious atmosphere.We first went to visit theThe Hall of Supreme Harmony . Our emperor used to live there.It is a symbol of power.Next ,we went to the Tongrentang.Our ancesstor used to make medicinein it.As soon as we entered, we smelled the medicine coming on our faces. It was accient.Then we went to the Kun Ning Palace and Qian Qing Palace.They are really huge and beautiful.
After that,we went to the store to bought some gifts for our friends and family.I bought a An old folding fan with some patterns .
We had a nice day in the Forbidden City.We knew a loot of tihings about our anccient China!
(It had a beautiful Exhibit of lanterns at night!!!!!!!)"
"On this winter vacation,I went to the Forbidden City with my family.The place was amazing! The buildings there are magnificent and stately with red walls and yellow roofs.The place is so large that you should visit it for a whole day.But I am sure you will enjoy walking here because the buildings of Chinese traders are over 500 years and you could image how brilliant the place were before.There are also many valuable cultural relic in the museum,such as jewelries,picture scroll and clocks.You will be surprised when you see those things. The Royal Garden is also famous in there. Each tree is over 600 years old and it is a really graceful place to relax yourself. But there are two negative issues that I want to remind.First,there are too many people so if you
want to go there,you should avoid the Spring Festival. Second,the food in the restaurant there is too expensive,so bringing your own food is better than eating there.
All in all,it is a worth going place.The best way to get there is by subway. You'd better book the tickets on the Internet before you get there.That's all.Wish you have a good time in the Forbidden City."
"I went to the Forbidden City with my mother today. It was sunny today and the sky was really clear. The Forbidden City is very big and the number of visitors can reach over 80000. So you should buy tickets online before you go there. There was a place for imperil family to live. It would be better if you find a tourist guide. I followed the tourist guide and got lots of interesting history stories. It can help with my history. Inside of the city is very luxurious. There are many golden ornament. I like them very much. We also took some beautiful photos. But i also saw some people writting letter on the wall. I felt angry with them. What they did can destroy the sense of the Forbidden City.
I visited in there for 5 hours. It should be noted that there is no cheap food in this place. So you need take own food or go out to eat. I went to the Changan street and tasted some local delicious food. I also bought some candy for my friends.
In the evening, i went back and felt very tired.
What a amazing day!"
"What a wonderful day! I went to the Palace Mucsum with my mom. This is a special day—Lantain Festival. There were many lantains around the Palace Museum. First of all,we visited the Clock Museum,we saw kinds of clocks from different countries as a gift to China. It was so amazing.
For lunch,we had a picnic at there,it was delicious. After lunch,we visited the Jewelry Museum. When I saw a lot of Jewelries I was suprised. I felt that the ancient people were so wise that they made great culture. The Palace Museum was founded in1925 and it is the first day that it gave the light show to the public. It was a pity for me because I couldn’t get the tickets,so I had to leave the Palace Museum at 4pm.
Tip:First,before you visit,you’d better learn history of the Palace Museum. Second,you better bring the camera with you. Last you’d better take some snacks because the food is expensive in it."
"The Palace Museum is in the center of the capital of China----Beijing,and it's definitely a must when visiting Beijing!

Last month,my parents and I visited the Palace Museum for the first time in my life and I promise it won't be the last time.That day was also my father's birthday and we celebrated together in this special way.Luckily,the weather was excellent and it was a good time to take photos.The old buildings with red walls were magnificent,I knew that how brilliant the ancestors of China were!There were many famous buildings worth visiting,such as the Hall of Supreme Harmony and the Meridian Gate,where the emperors lived before.

At noon,when we got to the restaurant,we found that there were many people waiting to have meals,so we had to wait for a long time for the meal,the food tasted great because I was so hungry!

In the afternoon,we also visited many buildings and gardens,I'm very tired because the Palace Museum was much bigger than I could imagine!We left there at 4:30 PM when it was closed.

All in all,the trip was great and significative.But remember to bring some food yourself,and it's better to visit here in a sunny day,so that you can take quite a few beautiful photos!

P.S. The Palace Museum is closed on Mondays,so don't visit here in a wrong day!And you'd better reserve the tickets online and take the public transportation.

I hope this review can help you,enjoy your trip to the Palace Museum,thanks!"
"Beijing is the capital of China,the Palace Museum is the center of Beijing.It has a lot of Chinese architecture.In the ancient,many kings lived here.It is the biggest museum of human culture in China.It was very prosperous in the past.There are many cultural relics in the Palace Museum,many of which are of great value for research.Here we can appreciate the palace life in ancient China.Around the Palace Museum,there are many snacks with local characteristics.Many people choos the travel here during holidays,so I suggest you can during the workdays.Since it is difficult to park nearby,subway travel is a good choice.The Palace Museum is a key scenic spot in Beijing,where several representative cultural relics are built.Nearby snacks and museums are also good choice.You won't be disappointed to be here!"
"Always wanted to visit this place. The mystery and architecture were always intriguing. Is vast, huge, big, enormous for sure. And beautiful though. Take enough time, comfy shoes and a good camera. Make yourself time to explore, go inside the various courts and gates and take a look on the side to the many areas, passages, small courts and explore. Save some time and energy for the imperial garden at the end ( as there is a clear flow to visit). It will definitely take a half day time."
Stunning place to visit. We were on a tour and that helped as we had good explanations and insights into the history. It is beautiful and enormous so allow 1/2 a day. In February the crowds were not huge which added to our enjoyment and everyone was respectful of each others desire for photos. Wander off and explore every nook you can as you will see something different around every corner and down little alley ways. You can't really get lost. Take a bottle of water if the weather is warm. Go home and watch the Last Emperor again and it will really come alive for you.
"On February fifth ,I went to the Palace museum. That is very big.So I did not visit all the
Museum.My sister was very exciting although she can not understand it.It is very beautiful too.We saw the red and high wall.But there were too many people.That is very
crowded.All in all,today is wonderful!"
"Last summer vacation,I and my mother went to the Forbidden City.It is the largest ancient buildings in the world.First,there transportation is convenient.You have a lot of ways to go to the Forbidden City.You can go there by No.1 Bus,No.10 Bus,No.120 Bus and so on,also you can choose No.1 subway line.I suggest you choose the public transportation.Because there is difficult to find a parking lot.
In the Forbidden City.Red well,yellow roof and blue sky.Everything looks so nice.What an incomparable buildings!But at the same time,it has its shortcoming.Because of its incomparable,so there is always have a lot of people.The worse things if that the Forbidden Ctiy covers an area of 720,000 square ,meters!I was very tired when I visited.Also the weather is sunny and hot.So when back home I am tired and hot."
"Interesting place, but VERY crowded. Okay, it's China, but at times it was really tricky to peek inside the buildings. Also: tickets sell out early, so get there before opening time and you should be fine. I can recommend this place; its special to walk around and Learn about the history of this Lovely country."
"Glad we visited. When you’re in the main courtyard, the place is big. But don’t stay in the main areas. Go off the side entrances. Many smaller buildings and courtyards are “hidden” from most people. If you consider all the stuff on the side, the place is huge. You can easily spend an entire day exploring the entire palace."
"I went to the Palace Museum with my family on February fifth, 2019. It was the spring festival in China that day. We went to the Palace Museum in the early morning. But still, there were many people there waiting to by the tickets. Luckily, we got three tickets. When we past through the front door, we saw Jinshui bridge, behind it was the Gate of Supreme Harmony. The square in front of the gate was crowded, but the Palace Museum was magnificent! we went to see the jewelries in the Treasure Hall. Unluckily, the Treasure Hall was too crowded that we didn't have a chance to take a picture. But the things inside was worth waiting. We had a happy morning and got out
at lunch time. But went back home was a problem. There were so many people waiting for the bus and there was a traffic jam! But, it's still a great day in the Palace Museum.
Tips:If you want to go to the palace museum, you should try to buy the tickets in the Internet or go to the museum in the early morning. During the holidays in China, the museum would be very crowded."
Built in the1500's its now called imperial Palace Museum.The largest ancient Chinese architectural structure still standing We started at the first section and were amazed and then the next and then the next and more.Wow
"An interesting thing to see how the emperor and the officials lived. Opulence for centuries. And the stories of the Court intrigue!

A must see for anyone visiting Beijing for the first time. Plan a couple of hours. Only one way through, entering from Tiannamen Square and exit is a half mile north, kind of in the middle of nowhere. Be prepared to taxi from there."
"Impressively massive and worth visiting.
To purchase tickets, either scan QR code at the entrance (for locals) or go to the small building by the side to purchase using Passports. For most attractions in Beijing, will need passport to buy tickets. And there are discounts for individuals aged 60 and above"
The Forbidden City provides nice piece of Chinese history. The buildings are very well maintain with good security. It's a must visit place in Beijing.
"Last month, my family and I went to the Forbidden City, it was so spectacular that I will never forfet it.
The Forbidden City has a long history, in 1406, emperor Yongle of the Ming dynasty began to build it, a total of 24 emperors lived in the Forbidden City, the first one is emperor Zhu Di, the last one is erperor Pi Yi.
After we acrossed the Duan door, was the main gate of the imperial palace - Wu gate. The Wu gate had five holes. Its plane was concave shape, magnificent. Behind the meridian gate were five exquisite white marble arch Bridges leading to the taihe gate.
Our first visited to follow three main halls, entered the gate, at a glance is expected to saw a stately building, was the hall of supreme harmony.Inside the palace there are powder gold lacquered wooden pillars and delicate coiling dragon caisson, the middle of the hall 2 meters high on the stage placed the symbol of the feudal imperial power - golden carved dragon throne, Before the throne there are beautiful shape of crane, furnace, tripod, the back is carved drThe tianfu yongtibet exhibition on the west side of baohe hall displays gold, silver and jade articles used by the royal family and tributes presented by local officials. There are big jade plates, gold bowls, ruyi, porcelain, purple sand pots, throwing pots and other royal life utensils, some crystal clear, some beautifully carved, some simple and natural, showing the royal luxury.
Finally, we mainly visited the imperial garden. The imperial garden is a place for the emperor to visit. There are pines and cypresses that never wither in winter, and exquisite rockery with beautiful stones piled on top of each other.
Anyway, what I want to say is that the Forbidden City is very imposing, you should visit it.
However, it is recommended that you don't go to visit the Forbidden City during the holiday, there may be a lot of people, and the price of the tickets will be so expensive."
"The Forbidden City in Beijing is very famous.It is the Chinese Imperial palace from mid-Ming Dynasty to the end of the Qing Dynasty.It is very big inside.It has gray stone floor and red wall and orange roof,if you see it from the sky you will see the Forbidden City is symmetrical, and that is our Chinese a ncient building 's amorous.The environment inside the Forbidden City is very fresh, some of the trees are planted by the Imperial hundred years ago."
"In this winter,I went to the Museum Palace with some of my friends.It was snowy,and it snowed heavily that every building in the Museum Palace was covered with snow and it was so amazing and beautiful.There were so many valuable historical relics,and every relic had an special story itself.We called for an expositor to explain the secrets behind those old things, and we really got many useful knowledge from this trip.We spent all day long staying there so we didn't eat lunch.After our visiting,we ate near the Museum Palace in a small noodle restaurant,and it's really delicious.If you want to know more about the history and culture of China,the Museum Palace is a must.And I strongly suggest you to taste the restaurant near there,it will become your most unforgettable experience."
"It was an extremely sunny day, despite of the frozen weather. However, it didn’t influence our feelings. Together with my mom and dad, we went to the Forbidden City. It was the fourth time I have been there, and supposed it wasn’t the last time.
It didn’t matter with the crowded ground, it was terrific! We headed a walk around the grand palaces and took some elegant photos of the turrets which were magnificent. Apart from that, we had a chat of the design of the architecture which was extraordinary as if done by the spirits. That’s undoubtedly significant.
There was another difference from the past three visits. We had a memorable period of time looking at the exhibitions which were timepieces an miniascape. The thing which attracted me the most was an exhibition which was iconic. That was like the shape of Pear Blossom and made of luxurious jade. All of the exhibitions were exquisite and gracious, and I couldn’t control myself exclaiming in a great surprise.
It seemed a little embarrassed that we were evicted by the security guards as we didn’t want to leave!
Tips: probably you need to go early if I were you since the famous sites. The treasures hall really worth a visit. Do not advised to take much time seeing in the main hall."
"Prepare to walk, a lot. The story of this is nice to have learned, it has many rooms and I think all the different names sound rather tranquil. You will at most things from the outside. If in Beijing, add this into your sightseeing activities."
"If in Beijing you have to visit the Forbidden City. Awe-inspiring in size and architecture, it can get a bit crowded but there are plenty of areas to explore in the accommodation area away from the crowds."
"Magnificent landmark to see it for yourself.
If do just walk directly from the front to the back, it is already a long walk.
Taking the crowd into consideration and waiting for photo spots......"
"Amazing and fantastic history, architecture etc but be prepared to walk and for large crowds and this was not peak season. Those that can steak English are very helpful."
"Purchase your ticket at right side before queuing. You need passport to purchase tickets.

Try get there as early as possible as it can get very busy mid morning.

Purchase an audio guide for 40RMB then go round at your own time at pace.

Very interesting"
"The thing with most beautiful landmarks, is that they’re popular which makes them crowded and I went out of the peak season! There are people everywhere which isn’t really surprising in a city of over 21 million people.

The scale of most things in Beijing is huge and the Forbidden City is no different. Most of the tours only take you through the middle buildings as they do multiple things in one day and because most people aren’t as interested in all the extra areas you can visit.

If you’re not short on time and want to explore all the rooms on the sides, you should set aside a big chunk of time (more than half a day) or let your private guide know you want to do more than just the standard tour on that day. If you don’t have a guide you can hire audio tours.

Wear comfy shoes, take some water (I don’t recall seeing anywhere to buy any once you were in the main area), steel yourself for the crowds and don’t visit on a Monday when its closed :)"
"It took me 5 hours to see the forbidden city. It’s really amazing.
Recommend to bring some snacks with you, there are few tiny shops sell drinks, biscuits, hot dogs, and chips. Not many food options inside.

Will love to go back again"
"Good Culture trip in China , we learned a lot about Chinese History here, Students pay a discounted rate."
"There nothing bad to be said about this place, except for maybe the huge crowd (even though it was very cold in the middle of the winter). It's beautiful, well-maintained grounds and buildings (halls) are something that I'd recommend to anyone that loves culture and history."
"Tickets of The Forbidden City is divided into morning’s and afternoon’s. There are also quotas for daily tickets. It is very important to buy tickets in advance. The morning ticket is required to enter before 12 o'clock, and the afternoon ticket to enter after 12 o'clock. Also, the Forbidden City will close on Monday."
The Forbidden City lies on one side of Tiananmen Square and is a huge palace complex from the Ming Dynasty to the end of the Qing Dynasty. Apart from the splendid Chinese architectural buildings and the huge courtyards there is a well organised route through the vast complex of some 980 buildings for the many thousands of visitors. Yes it was crowded in parts and again in China mainly visited by the Chinese people. A must visit especially for the culture and history.
First of all be careful that you don't go on a Monday! Once you get there be sure you have at least 5 hours... if you are traveling with young children be sure to also bring your stroller as the walking can get tiresome. We recommend the self-guided tour for 20 RMB at the front gate. There are a lot of steps but not so many that make a stroller unmanageable. Going in the offseason such as the weekend after Chinese New year for the golden week is highly advisable and allow for wonderful photo opportunities. you will be required to buy separate tickets for the garden which we did not do on this trip but the normal tickets are 40 RMB.
"It is a MUST go! When you go ... you will learn so much about the impact that the Chinese dynasties had on China, and the world. It is huge ... and I spent 2 days there. I came away with such a deeper understanding of the Chinese history and present day. It was very crowded but the property is so huge ... you could get around and maneuver without much of a hassle. The Chinese people were friendly, and accommodating to this American."
"The history of the Forbidden City is fascinating and to visit it and see the incredible buildings, interiors, courtyards, museum and stories was magical. Not to be missed, along with the incredible views of Beijing and its surroundings. Highly recommended."
"Beijing being the cultural city of China holds one of the main monumental asset in shape of “Forbidden City”
A very huge place with loads of tourists everywhere.
One must need to know about the Dynasties in China in order to understand well about this place.
Too many gates, imperial garden , a huge surrounding wall spanning over hundreds of meters.If you want to know about the culture of China, then its a must visit place."
"Still awesome to get to know the historical values of China.
Perfectly preserved architecture .
Beautiful trees.
The visitors and local Chinese makes it even better with some even rented costumes to dress up and walk around .
Perfect picture moment in my opinion.
Worth the visit as the entry ticket is not expensive .
Do go for it if you are here . Don’t waste the opportunity. Easy to locate by walking , just look at the signage. You don’t even need gps."
It will take you a few hours to go through this complex and see everything. Is better if you take audio tour guide for only 40 yuans.
"My wife and I really enjoyed our private tour. We started in the Tian'anmen Square area and then walked to/through Forbidden City area which is next to Tian'anmen. Quite a bit more walking than we were expecting, but very informative and many beautiful buildings to see and stories to hear. Highly recommend going with a guide that can give you so much more insight to all the different things a normal tourist would not have a glue about. Altogether, we spent about 3 hours at both Tian'anmen and Forbidden City and it was not too crowded either. Nice amount of time to enjoy both."
Spent several hours with a tour group exploring the complex but given time to explore on our own too. A must when in Beijing but wear comfy shoes as it is enormous. Visited 5 years ago so time to revisit.
The palace is really big unfortunately there were too many areas under renovation including the residence of the king. No doubt it is one of the greatest piece of architectures in China.
"We spend there almost half day, too much to see, too much people, and young kids, it was great to book a private tour guide, but if you are in a budget there are some audio gadgets you can rent.

Nice place and it is a really must... if you are in Beijing, you have to visit this place at least once!"
"chose to visit, again, during the Spring festival. Although the streets of Beijing were quiet and devoid of all kinds of traffic, the tourist spots are quite busy! Having easily booked tickets online, it was just as easy entering this 'Forbidden City'.
I still marvel at the construction which does not have any nails to keep everything together!! Great woodwork and workmanship so many years in the past.
Good thing too was the possibility for having hot coffee and meals in the various onsite restaurants although quite crowded at this time."
"I strongly recommend you book a tour to visit the Forbidden City, in order to get a proper understanding of what you’re seeing. However, when booking your tour check where other reviewers are from...we booked a tour with a 5* tour guide whose English was terrible and was a complete waste of money. After the tour we looked back at her reviews and the 5* reviews where from people who spoke Chinese, her English speaking tours had rated her 1*.

Buy tickets ahead of time as there is a limit on the amount of people who can enter each day."
"A visit to Beijing is not complete without the Forbidden City. There is timed admittance, which is great as it controls the crowds. Suggest you buy tickets on line to save time and queing at the site!"
"You'll need to allocate practically the whole day at this place (even if do not spend sufficient time appreciating its rich history or its marvelous architecture), as walking through this museum itself will take a huge toll on your legs due to its massive built-up space (i.e. more than 700,000 sq m).

Anyway, your day tour to the Palace Museum typically begins from the Tiananmen Gate, which is the South entrance to the Museum, and also where the giant photo of Chairman Mao Zedong stands tall. Upon securing your entrance tickets, you shall enter the Museum via the Meridian Gate (午门), where you shall walk past a majestic giant gate plus an approximately 20m-long tunnel before arriving inside the palace grounds.

Once inside, you shall be greeted by a familiar sight of the Hall of Supreme Harmony (太和殿) which stands majestically at the central foyer. This Hall is commonly seen in many Chinese period dramas where the Emperor is based. In addition to this Hall, there are of course many other halls, towers, pavilions, and even gardens located throughout the Palace Museum.

Do take your time to appreciate the beautiful sculptures and other architectural designs throughout the entire Palace. You can even walk on the parapet walls along the perimeter of the Palace Museum, to get a good bird's eye view of the surroundings. In addition, if it's still bright enough by the time you exit the Museum via the North exit after your tour, do pay a visit across the road to the Jingshan Park (entrance fees separate) to get a magnificent view of the entire Palace Museum landscape from the Wanchun Pavilion, which is the highest point inside Jingshan Park, plus a stunning sunset view as well (timing and weather-permitting)."
"We traveled to Beijing and thought of visiting this must go attraction during chinese new year. went through the security check and into the gate with lots of excitement, only to realize that No. 1, the Palace is closed on Monday. No 2. you must get the individually identified online ticket beforehand. we went back to the hotel, and tried to book online. but it was all sold out for the duration of the entire week we are there. for people who intend to visit, please be reminded that getting the ticket 10 days in advance is crucial. otherwise, you will end up just checking out the gate of the forbidden city (along with lots of crowds).

as a consolation price, we checked out the Jing Shan Garden which is north of the Palace where you can get a bird's eye view of the palace. it is quite nice."
"The complex is huge - be prepared to walk - but well worth it. The audio tour is quite good - without it or a guide you’ll not have the full experience at all. There are many little corners and details to explore, and the art and history is impressive, in addition to the grand scale of the complex.

Be aware, visits are one-way - you enter one end, and exit another. This saves you a long walk inside, but you’ll need to plan for it in how you plan to leave!"
"Palace Museum Beijing aka The Forbidden City is steeped in the richness of culture. Good visit for all categories of travellers especially for solo ones. Spend a day or two with a guide or without one marvelling at the ancient works.
All you need is an entrance ticket easily purchased from Klook online and remember to bring your passport. Definitely a place with loads of hidden locations for the perfect picture selfie or not. Also remember to bring additional cash if you love to take home souvenirs from the museum stores. Be selective of the day you want to visit and of course if possible avoid weekends and any public holidays."
"Sadly we were unable to get tickets as all 80,000 tickets per day were sold out for the whole of the chinese New Year week!
If you can't get a ticket, go to Jing Shan park, climb up to the highest point where there is lovely pagoda (steep steps) where you can see the whole of the Forbidden city."
"The Forbidden city is a MUST! It is a beautiful place full of history. We absolutely loved visiting, it’s incredible how many people actually fit in it. I would suggest going early in the morning. Get ready for it to be crazy full. It’s really insane how many people go."
"We visited here during our week long holiday visit to Beijing (our first trip to the country, I might add). It was a two shot visit, both Tian Anmen square (which is quite politically charged) and the forbidden city. It really was a nice visit with a lot to see. One small note, the place is genuinely massive, so get ready for a long walk!"
Forbidden City and the adjacent Tiananmen Square are must visit places on your trip to Beijing. However the crowds are incredibly large and flowing. As you move towards and thru the gates you get a sense of what water in a garden hose is like. Dont try fight against and plan your change of directions well in advance.
This is a must when visiting Beijing. The place is huge and unique. The museum has many artifacts that date back to a different time. It's a good place to learn about Chinese history.
This area was so beautiful. We were able to get there easily via the subway from the airport. Well I say easily . . . that was after we found someone who spoke English who told us where to to. Without that person who knows where we would have ended up. The grounds were beautiful and the area was so massive. I just wish we had more time to explore even more. So much history.
The Forbidden City is such a HUGH place and easy to access. The buildings and temples seem to go on for ever. The view of the surrounding city is spectacular and worth the trip.
A must! Don’t miss to walk around up on the wall. A tips is to read the book Empress Orchid before going. A fab place
"You really need several days to get the whole picture. The most amazing buildings, trees, and sights. Bring you comfy shoes, but it is so worth it. Get a guide to ge the full effect."
"It was a nice place to go, read all about beijing history, how the emperor lived. We decided to take the audioguide and it was a great choice"
"The Forbidden City is every bit as impressive as I had been led to believe. There are so many buildings to check out, many with historical pieces of art and furniture."
"The Forbidden City got its name because ... well, it was forbidden for almost anyone to enter it for over 500 years. Officially known as the Palace Museum, take advantage of its open status and visit the Beijing sight, if you can, for the better part of a day. Built as a palace in the early 15th century for emperors and their family starting during the Ming Dynasty, the site includes 800 buildings and 9000 rooms, from the Meridian Gate entrance to the exhibition halls and private offices.
As a foreigner you need a passport to get in"
The sheer size of the forbidden city is pretty amazing. Enjoyed walking around and taking it all in. It was a bit frustrating that you pay for your entrance and then once in you have to pay again if you want to go in the treasure room. Would have preferred to just pay more at the start and not have to pay again as you go through.
"The Forbidden City served as the home of emperors and their households as well as the ceremonial and political center of Chinese government for almost 500 years. The architecture is breathtaking and the city is huge. It takes a lot of time to see and visit the palaces and see their interiors from outside. It is typical and ancient Chinese architecture. Specific areas were fixed for the people living there and forbidden for others. The king and queen had separate areas and the servants were separate, their entry was forbidden in the king's areas. This is what our guide told us. Anyways, the palace is awesome and worth visiting. A landmark of Beijing and should not be missed."
"We spent almost the entire day here and still felt that we have barely seen it all. With more than 9 thousand rooms, though not all opened, this palace was built with grand designs. Rented a location-sensitive translator which explains the history behind buildings was a good decision."
Had seen the beautiful forbidden City on TV or pictures but seeing it live and knowing the history of it from our knowledgeable tour guides made the experience so interesting and memorable.
"One of the three reasons I came to China (the others being The Great Wall and The Terra-Cotta Warriors). Can't go inside most of the buildings, but the exteriors are amazing. Beautiful pagoda styled roofs accented with ornately painted trim.
Make sure to have a guide to explain the history to you"
"Luckily I had a guided tour here with a English speaking guide. He was quite amazing, booked from a layover tour. This place is so beautiful I can’t lie. I’m sort of a history junkie so I live for things like this. Being from the US where our history is short compared to the dynasties of China it’s interesting to see how people lived and the ways and thinking of those who walked the grounds. It was the beginning of Chinese New Year too so it was dope to see them putting out decorations for the holiday."
An important historical landmark. The Royal palace is very large. I'd recommend either hiring a guide or joining a tour group as you won't really know what you are looking at without some commentary as it's vast and a lot of the buildings and structures look similar. Most of the buildings you can't go inside or there's not much to see.
"exceptional site, crowded but so worth it- loved every bit of the visit, spend at least 2h looking at the detail of the architecture"
"An absolute must-see in Beijing. I enjoyed doing a solo tour, but be prepared to book your tickets in advance online. If you go later in the day (especially in summer) you may not be able to get tickets, and in the mornings there are big lines."
"Absoluely awesome, the heritage and beauty of this place, would definately visit again, we both loved it"
If you go to Beijjing this is place where you should visit. You need time hole day because this is really big place. You need passport when you buy ticket. Should take good shoes there.
Awesome place!! Definitely a must see and boy was it huge!! Loads of history and culture. Toilets were gross and lineups for female disabled huge as it was often the only western style toilet available. Limited food or drink options so take food with you as it is a long walk.
We included this on our tour of the Forbidden City and were not disappointed by the treasures inside
"My partner and I visited the Forbidden City as part of our private day tour, which included The Great Wall, Tinammen Square and The Forbidden City.
Admittedly, I do not know much about China's history, so I was unsure of what to expect. Luckily as we had our guide, we walked into the Forbidden City with someone knowledgeable about the history and she was able to give us lots of information about the area and the dynasty's who lived here. There are also lots of information boards, wrote in both English and Chinese, which gives you the information for each room and section of the Forbidden City.
I would advise you spend about an hour exploring the area and read the information boards to gain a good insight into the history surrounding you. Also, remember, if you are a foreign tourist, take your passport with you in order to purchase your ticket."
"My recommendations: watch ""The Last Emperor""; then buy an entry ticket, get a map and nothing else. As you walk around you can imagine the life; both the life of privilege and luxury, and the separation from the real world. There are plenty of English speaking ""guides"" offering packages and hassling people close to the entrance. I ignored them and if I wanted something like that, would have asked the company I was visiting (and maybe the hotel), as I have no idea about the price and quality."
"While this was interesting, it did go on and on and each area looked like the area we just left. The history is interesting. Be sure you have a good tour guide to talk to you about the buildings and what they were used for otherwise you will not get a good understanding of this site."
"1. You must show your passport, so don’t forget your passport, a good news you also can show a photo in your cellphone or a photocopy.

2. If have a Student card, you obtain 50% discount at the entrance. (Should be undergraduate but sometimes if your ID don’t have any mark about under or postgraduate you will not have problems) ticket around (40-60¥) or (around 10$).

3. You can go through the halls between the tian’anmen (gate of heaven) and palace without any fee (free). To go inside the palace, the ticket office is on the right hand before the control of the tickets.

4. You can take the metro line 1 to arrive there. tian’anmen east is the closest but tian’anmen west have the exit to national center for the performing arts (beautiful theater) beautiful and amazing architecture.

5. If you have time and energy, Visit the Forbbiden City also during the afternoon, tian’anmen (outside) after 5:30pm, why ? Because at 6:00pm they have the lowered of the flag in the square and the view of tian’anmen changes, it looks beautiful with the lights. (If you read tip 4, you should go to the theater at night also)

6. Jingshan Park (coal hill) the small hill when you go out from forbbiden city, the fee is 2¥ and 1¥ if you are student, so don’t lose the opportunity to see the forbidden city from the top of the hill, looks big but is less than 10- 15 minutes rich the top. Also is much easier take a taxi or bus at the east or west exit of the park.

7. The entrance is from South Gate and the exit is at north gate, so you will not go out at the same place.

8. Consider at least 3-4 hours to see it, they have additional visits, I like them and I will visit them again, but if you don’t have enough energy and your schedule is run off time avoid visit them.

9. Take a tour and audio guide or at least Read something about the forbidden city and China, if not you will not understand why the roof are yellow, or how they get warm at winter, instead everything will look the same for you."
"No trip to Beijing is complete without visiting the Forbidden City, an imperial palace used from the Ming dynasty through the Qing dynasty. You'll want to purchase your tickets online or with your hotel concierge staff. Your ticket is linked to your passport so taking your passport along is a must as it is scanned upon entrance. The palace is located across from Tiananmen Square and is within walking distance from the Hilton Wangfujing. You should use the South Gate to enter the palace. This was my second visit to the Forbidden City and opted to not utilize a tour guide and instead purchased the electronic audio guide for an independent walking tour. As English is my native language, the audio guide translates better than a local tour guide and the cost is far easier on the budget. You also gain the advantage of touring the Forbidden City at your own pace, making the tour of the Forbidden City less time than you would with a human tour guide. The palace grounds are remarkable with interesting architecture and statutes, multiple buildings with living quarters, meeting spaces, and post nuptial accommodations for the royal family. The tour ends with a serene stroll through the palace gardens...the restrooms (toilets) are found there too! Wear comfortable walking shoes and you'll want to take plenty of pictures during your tour of the palace.E
enjoy your tour!"
"There is much to marvel at the grandeur of the Forbidden City and we were lucky enough to have our own guide to make it interesting and informative. However as we experienced in India, many of the building have beautiful colours on the outside but are often empty inside.

You also can’t help but be skeptical sometimes about the usage of the buildings when you ask as each one appeared to have the same use. It was great being around so many people as it was the start of Golden Week, and some of the extra pageantry was a nice touch. The gardens do deserve a special mention, it was very different and quite peaceful.

I’m glad I went, but personally there were much better places to come on our trip."
"The Forbidden City is a must see in Beijing. This was part of an organised day tour I bought with Tour Beijing (Tour China Team)
It is about 1.5 kilometre long, be prepared to do quite a bit of walking and you must be able to climb steps but it is very interesting, no Beijing visit is complete without visiting this historical and iconic place."
The sheer size of this building is incredible. On this beautiful day there was quite a crowd. A visit is worthwhile in any case.
Been here quite a few years back and this revisit is just as good as the first time. We explored most everything...taking our time of 5 hours at this place. As foreigners..I found it difficult to get the tickets online so we just showed up with passports and bought the tickets there. Go early and that will not be a problem. Bring snack and drink to fill you up cos the few restaurants there are always packed.
"Went during non peak period when is not so crowded. Enjoy the palace fully and gets to know the history behind.

The whole area is huge and good to spend time walking around and taking photos. Will be back again one day for another round."
"We visited Beijing taking care to avoid the national holiday, on the strict advice of our chosen tour guide. Despite this the entrance to The Forbidden City was a crush. Locals queue without regard to personal space so we maintained close, almost physical contact with the guide. Once you get used to it you can enjoy this jostling shuffle.

Once inside the press was more relaxed as the crowd spread out. Never the less it was important to keep tabs on the guide. Fortunately, he had Bluetooth earpieces for us so we missed nothing of his commentary. The visit is a linear flow through this huge site, so be prepared for plenty of walking. Sadly, we frequently came across Western visitors from larger tour groups who had become detached from their party and were lost and bewildered. Make your guide your best friend and stay close!

We suggest that either before you go or afterwards, and you surely must visit this wonderful place, watch the film “The Last Emperor” to enrich the visit."
Worth reading up on or having a tour to really understand the history of the Forbidden Palace. Beautiful.
"I stayed in Beijing for 2 days and visited many places, I reckon Forbidden City is no.1 across all amazing attractions you may visit in Beijing. Just as a tip, at the entrance gate you will be offered Automatic Guide, I strongly recommend to use it."
Blown away by the extremely lavish way the Emperors lived in this era. Good for a wander to take in the sights.
"You'll need a whole day to see the Palace. Take your time- during peak season it will be crowded. I traveled in December- the crowd was small but it was very cold. Go early in the morning when it opens, bring your passport for entrance, and a tour book. You can only enter from the Tiananmen square side and can only exit directly through the other side of the city. The area is large and there are sites within the city like the clock museum and the nine dragons mural. There are several touristy shops within the city, they have different items so peak into many (especially towards the back city walls) before buying. There is also a wonderful cafe serving lunch which is a nice break from the crowds."
"The forbidden city is absolutely stunning and a must see when in Beijing. A word of caution however, there are quite a few scammers in the area, so try to avoid people making requests, promoting art etc..."
A fascinating and large palace. Many buildings and amazing architecture. A great journey into what China did as part of its history. Only disappointment we had is that our time was limited and we did not go through some of the historical buildings.
"Make sure you have your passport or ID, otherwise the cashier at the gate won't sell you any tickets! Then get the audio guide and start your journey through the gates, temples and centuries.
We were lucky to visit the Palace on the 4th of January. as there were not too many tourists and we had the access to all the places of interest. The tour of the Forbidden City was OK, however the choice of souvenirs was not as good, as expected."
"Great place, very spread out,
Prepare for walking!
Easy half a day browsing or maybe full for history lovers!
Nice shades and seats for rest!

Incredible history!"
"Although it is nice, it can be a long walk for some. And it can start to become a little repetitive. Nonetheless, I'm glad we visited here and we'd probably go back if we're ever to visit Beijing again."
Been there twice and still find it amazing. If only seeing two places in Beijing then the square and forbidden city. So much history
"I took time out to visit the Forbidden city. Please put on you walking shoes.
Please note...I found it a little difficult to book on line as the website only offered Mandarin. My hotel booked for me. Once you get there you show your passport, and that’s it, your in. You will find lots of people trying to be you guide. I opted to a 40RMB sound guide which was really cool, as it had built in GPS. So no confusion as to what it was saying and where I was at any giving time. It all made good sense.
Please allow at least half a day, as you will probably add in Tianiman Square.A great experience."
"Thus is the highlight of Beijing. Be careful on going to the correct Gate for entering. If you are at the North Gate, then it is quite difficult to reach the gate near Tiananmen and you are directed to take an expensive tourist bust to take you to the other side"
Interesting place but so many of the building were closed and some looked a little tired a bit of a maze we had a listening guide and mine stopped working before we got half way round and when I told them on the way out all they said was sorry
I was on an a 8 hour stopover in Beijing and got a visa at airport and caught the public metro int to see this place featured in so much history. It was super cheap and easy to navigate. You need cash and can get at ATM in arrivals hall before you head to the airport express into city. you need to do a few changes but then pop out in Tianimen square. The museum opens at 8.30 and you have a bi of walking to get to entry. you need your passport to buy a ticket on the left as you get to entry gates. Once inside you ca wander at your leasiure and see the beauty of this palace and garden complex. Very worthwhile and accessible if you have not been and have a short stopover.
"Forbidden city has so much history, all of it fascinating. But get a guide, human, electronic or written, otherwise you will miss such a lot of history behind this collection of red buildings"
"It's a nice visit if you like museums and history. You must have your passport, as it is used as a ticket to get in. The square is just next to Forbidden City so you can kill two birds at the same time. I would probably enjoy it more if it wasn't freezing :)"
"Good and cheap advise you pay the extra approximate £4 for WiFi guidance, think about the route as it’s a long walk but very interesting"
I really enjoyed the forbidden city but if you’re uncomfortable with huge crowds then be careful. It’s definitely worth seeing and there are some amazing views to be had.
"This place is huge.
Well worth a visit, takes about. 4 hours to see all of it.
If you pre-book online your passport is your ticket.

Best to take guided route as you can't exit the way you came in.

Audio guides available for 40 RMB, your own headphones won't fit."
"While in Beijing one of the great highlights is the forbidden city, also known as the palace museum was the home to Chines emperors from the Qing and Ming dynasties. This is an amazing place to visit the grounds are huge so allow plenty of time half a day at least and where comfy shoes there is lots to see and lots of walking required.
Once you enter through the gate the vastness of the palace open in front of you it is breath taking. This is a UNESCO listed historical site.
The forbidden city consists of a number of palaces and halls, the hall of supreme Harmony is a testimony to the workmanship and detail put into the design and construction of the city.
Be sure to visit the East and West area’s of the city also, it is worth researching some of the history of the forbidden city before visiting."
"there a lot of history in there, try to feel the aura... there so many Dynasty who rule the empire. the silent witness the replacement of power the emperror"
"This is an impressive place. And huge. After 3 hours I was drained of energy and then there were still more to see. I’m glad we were there in December, and on a Thursday, which was not high season for tourists. That made it possible to walk around just as you wanted. Security checks and tickets were very smooth."
Has to be done - you walk through thick gateway upon thick gateway - going through the layers of this city and revealing more inside each section and its history til you reach the emperors house and the small city within this area and then onto the concubines gardens - fascinating your not allowed to go into any of the houses just allowed to view in from the doorway which is a little disappointing but you must go if in Beijing - we stopped at the large parkland and had tea in small tea shop and sampled many teas.
"Went on a Saturday, there's some crowd but manageable. Please avoid peak period as it was very crowded on 31 December as I pass by.

Impressive collection and great preservation of the palace. A must visit UNESCO site."
"It was day 1 of our China Discovery 10 days tour from Nexus holidays. I was dreaming to get to Chine for a while, so was extremely interested in all of the places of interest ! The Forbidden city is unique. Its buildings gorgeous. I was in love with roofs, the architecture and colors used! It a must visit place in China! The only thing I didnt like was that you can only see the buildings from the outside, no access to the inside of the Emperor residence."
"onstructed from 1406 to 1420
in 1987 listed by UNESCO as the largest collection of preserved ancient wooden structures in the world
... The former Chinese imperial palace from the Ming dynasty to the end of the Qing dynasty (the years 1420 to 1912)
Its an honor to walk through its streets and rooms , rich history"
If you love learning histories. This is a great place but you should do it with a local guide. You will never regret it!
"I was here in January of 2007. The Forbidden City is nowhere near what it's name implies;anyone and everyone frequents here, with plenty of large crowds."
"Spent 5hrs and can use more but kiddo got fuzzy and we decide to leave. Even my 7year son absolutely loved it. We are all impressed by the grand places and the collection in the museums that required a small fees, one with gadget clocks, the other with other royal treasures. The royal garden was however very crowded and thus less impressive."
Despite temperatures of -20 and so bitterly cold this was a truly magical experience. Very quiet to visit in December and no queues or hustle and bustle. Therefore you could savour the magic of the place. No photo could ever do this justice.
Going through the forbidden city is one of the best experiences of Beijing. Absolutely beautiful and very cool.
"You need some sort of ID to buy tickets at the gate, and don't be intimidated by the crowds just walk with them and you will be fine. This place is huge, and we only paid for the main area. You start at the beginning and walk to the end. The palaces get more grand as you go up. It is amazing to see it all. Its super cheap to get in. This is well worth the trip. Busy as Beijing goes, but worth it."
"Pros: Great display of the huge palace buildings with various root top decorations.
Great gardens with specially crafted trees and stones.
There is also a special exhibition of clocks, but that is optional.
Low entrance fee RMB40-60 each.

Cons: Advance (online) bookings only accept credit/debit card payment issued from a mainland China bank.
All admissions require visitors to present their passports or acceptable IDs, and that need to match with the corresponding booking details.
In addition to security check at all underground stations, one more security check to get into the TianAnMen Square, and another security check to get into the museum.
The GPS driven spoken guide often does not work.
All palace buildings (apart from the gate buildings) are closed. Visitors can only peek from outside the buildings through small openings.
There is no covered area in the event of rain or snow.
There is no seat, or any catering facility.
While it is probably a must to see for those into the Chinese culture, unfortunately the palace buildings alone do not seem to provide huge appeal for ordinary visitors.
There is no taxi stand or metro station at the exit."
good building with all the China Qing dynasty history. Auto guide is rent-able after the ticket gate which only cost around RMB 40(if not mistaken). Must visit when you visit beijing
Rent an audio guide in your preferred language at the ticket kiosk before entering. The system is GPS powered so it will give you all the facts about any given area that you walk to within the Forbidden City. A great value!
"Like any historical site that is incredible old the pictures are usually better and more mysterious. Up close and personal it is a large stark space that badly needs a coat of paint, yes I know you can't ruin an ancient patina, but it is what it is"
Prepare yourself to walk. Would be nice to visit in Autumn. Use wechat pay to buy admission tickets to avoid long line ups.
"The size of the place is just mind blowing and then you add the beauty of the buildings. The incredible details of the roofs. Simply beautiful, could spend days exploring all the different area's."
"Lily with Inter Trips was our guide for The Square & Forbidden City. She was a treasure of information. Think BIG when you see these two places you'll know what I mean. The private garden at the end of the Forbidden City was my favorite w/ naturalized stone, beautiful man made mountains, lovely paving and ancient trees."
"Once again, must see attraction in China. Highly recommended to visit in the late morning to avoid the busiest time of the day. Located next to Tiananmen Square, you could arrange your visit together. Pre booked the tickets online so much faster and easier only show your paper tickets or screen shot on your phone. Is one of the places your would like to do it on your own, no rush as takes up to 3 or 4 hours to see most of the areas."
"The Forbidden city is an expansive complex, much like a babushka Russian doll set, just when you think you have reaches the end, another layer opens up. There are multiple temples and palaces within the complex so you need to give yourself a few hours to see most of it. There are lots of stairs and thresholds to walk over, so wear comfortable shoes. Not really wheelchair friendly. There are restroom in several places and a tea/cafe shop for refreshments. While there are tours you can take, it is not necessary as the information plaques a sufficient and will avoid information overload of facts and figures which often accompany the tour guides delivery. There is a metro near by so you can get there easily. Don't forget to walk across to Tiananmen Square ... It's history aside, it is an interesting place with various monument to the people and if you time it right you might be able to see Mao's mausoleum ... The times are very limited (we missed out unfortunately)."
"The largest ancient palace in the world
China’s Forbidden City.
Just be sure to bring your most comfortable walking shoes.
Some of you may have romanticised views of the Forbidden City due to a staple of popular Period Dramas.
Many of the rooms remain out-of-bounds, and palace can get very touristy (ie noisy, crowded and everything) due peak seasons."
"First visit the Tiananmen Square then enter into the forbidden city. This is huge palace surrounded by a canal which was entirely frozen. We went on a chilly day so not much queue in ticket counter.Even if you haven't booked it online there are QR code enabled tickets so not much time goes into that.
The palace is a collection of few thousands rooms where kings used to live for hundred of years.In my opinion please take a guide as without guide you may feel bored due to similar structure and long stretch."
Forbidden City is a must-do in Beijing. Wear comfortable walking shoes and be ready to take lots of pictures!
This place is HUGE and there is a lot to see. Hard to believe it is a working place for Chinese diplomats.
We spent half a day here and felt like we had barely seen the highlights of the area. I think would be great to see with a private guide and without the overall hordes of people visiting the area.
Mind blowing Place to visit -we did this as part of a tour (localpanda.com- can be booked from the uk in advance) and has a great English speaking guide who was so knowledgeable.
"This place just can’t be described in a few words and photos just don’t do it justice. You really have to see it to believe it. It’s absolutely huge and provides an amazing insight into the emperors of the past and how they lived, highly recommend!"
Visited on Christmas Day and found it pleasantly uncrowded with beautiful clear sky background the photo opps were great. Used the automatic guide but found most of the information well explained in English on noticeboards.
Amazing architecture! Just a marvel all around. Take the audio tour because without it you do not get the whole picture. Besides tits cheep under 10$. The history lesson will be well worth it
"We went around 10am and the crowds were not so bad, probably because its in December and pretty cold. Didn't walk around too much except into the Treasure Gallery. Recommend the park North of the Forbidden City if you don't have much time, get a great view from there!"
"To be able to see the palace of the emperors is definitely wonderful, and the palace is of course beautiful, but the crowd is way too large which almost ruins the experience."
"There is lots or little to say about the city, it is just awesome and huge. You need a minimum of 4 hours to see most of the places up to 2 days if you want a complete view. And it’s packed with people.
Only 2 minor things:
1-doesn’t feel very comfortable to be starred at so intensely by the locals and,
2-yes there are pickpockets amid high security coverage."
This is a huge place! Good walking shoes are required. We visited it during the late afternoon in winter. The place was peaceful as there were not many people there. Audio guides are available but they’re not very responsive... Would have been better if there were more English signs around.
There was a diplomat that decided to visit while we were there and the soldiers made us leave 20 minutes after getting
The scale of the place is awesome and know this is a must-see but unfortunately our visit felt very rushed with our guide from China Links ; not his fault but there were a lot of tourists and we were walked down the side routes not actually round the outsides of the main buildings. Did not realise you would not be able to go into many of the Pavllions. So a little disappointing.
"The Forbidden City is awesome and was one of my favourite places in Beijing. Go in the morning so you have enough time, I’d say 3 hours at the very least! The Palace and the grounds are huge. We only had 1.5 hrs and it was far from enough. The palace is closed on Monday, don’t make the same mistake as us and make sure you have plenty of time to walk around and enjoy the place."
"Well it was a Sunday when i visited this palace and i can say it seemed like whole of Beijing was in the palace. it was quite crowded however the massiveness of the palace absorbed everyone.

Tips:
- Carry your passport as that is required to get entry
- do watch the clock/watch museum as some of the clocks were truly fascinating
- can miss the treasure museum as it has limited items and with massive crowds and small hallway makes it difficult to enjoyy
- As its a massive compound you would need 2-3 hours to fully enjoy the grandeur of the place"
"I know the Forbidden City (FC) is a must-do in Beijing, but I can say out of the many places I visited during a 3 week trip to China, this was the only one I did not enjoy. For starters the place is over-crowded (even in low tourist season) and monotonous since every pavilion looks the same. People are not allowed into any of the pavilions located on the main court, so, they resort to pushing and shoveling to get a sliver of a view of what may lay inside. Multiply this experience for all the pavilions to be seen and you will conclude that the place is far from pleasant, and because of the sheer dimensions of the monument, the visit is also very tiring.
Personally, I enjoyed the visit to the Forbidden City in Hue (Vietnam) much better. The arrangement of the buildings is similar, as is the art decorating them, but unlike China, in Hue visitors are allowed inside every building (although the throne and furniture are cordoned off, as expected) and it attracts far fewer tourists, so the experience is A LOT more pleasant."
"We went mid December 2018 and all West side palaces were closed for renovation. We didn’t go towards the East side so unsure whether these were open.
The audio guide is a waste of money and doesn’t work. Don’t bother getting one."
"Along with 80,000 others we entered the Forbidden City. That's the cutoff of entrance tickets, so if you visit on a holiday time, be prepared. But the City can absorb the 80000 and once inside the crowd disperses so that it isn't really a bother. Wonderful glimpse of what Imperial China was like."
"I have had the chance to visit the Forbidden City before, but was so happy to see it again in cooler weather. It was a clear day in Beijing and the lines to get in were not long at all. I enjoyed the opportunity to slowly peruse the buildings and artwork. I just wish I had worn warmer socks!

The gift shop at the end with jewelry, mugs, and other trinkets was quite nice. My colleagues purchased high quality items at a fair price."
"When we visited, the weather in Beijing was negative double digits and it was freezing. Since we speak Chinese, we hired a Chinese tour guide which I highly recommend because if not you’re just walking blindly around without any proper understanding (if you don’t speak Chinese i’m Sure they have tour guides that speak other languages as well). We spent around 4 hours here and it was freezing however it was definitely worth it seeing all the historical structures from almost centuries ago."
"Great compounds and palaces
The architecture is very intricate and great dragons everywhere.
It's a must meet in a lifetime"
Forbidden city is a must to see if you travel to Beijing. They have restored this city to perfection with such vibrant colour. The city is a reflection of their great hostory and has an amazing story to tell. There is so much culture and tradition within the walls.
"A MUST VISIT! The City looks very epic and WOW in real life as compared to the photos. If you really want to visit every single place it will take probably half a day! We walked down the straight path and also walked right to the top to walk around the palace from the top.

BRING YOUR PASSPORT along because they use your passport as tickets and they will also use your passport when you go pass security check at Tian An Men.

If you are doing forbidden city, you will walk pass tian an me square so you can do both on the same day. Prepare half a day for this. Some people will end of their day by climbing up to jingshan park to get a birds eye view of the palace.

They accept visa card for ticket purchase"
"I’m still not able to fathom how they were able to build something so spectacular in order to create the best feng shui with no aerial surveillance, no laser levels or electric tools. They built a man made mountain and lake just to keep the feng shui!"
"This place is unbelievably beautiful, mesmerising and you can feel the dynasties history. Has thousands of rooms and needs a fun day to finish as much as you can. Pictures can be stunning there"
The area is vast and expansive but worth the walk. There is so much to see in this opulent palace. An absolute must
It was an epic day in one of the oldest civilizations' landmarks ever. The heart of Beijing's historical enigma
"Amazing, mind blowing. So much to see, fantastic architecture and ornate decoration. Our guide was incredibly informative and we had a brilliant time. If you have seen the Acropolis and been in awe of how early civilisations lived, then this is even more amazing and interesting for a range of reasons."
This was an Interesting and beautiful place. I spent several hours looking and learning. It’s well worth the time
"We spent half a day in the Forbidden City. Great to visit, to get to know an important part of the Chinese history, of the various Chinese Emperors during the most important Chinese dynasties."
"A great historic place to visit, definitely need an experienced guide. So many fun stories, and historic facts to learn. Wear comfortable shoes! Remember: enter from the South and exit from the North. Then walk east to Wangfujing Street, it's a strange mix of shopping area: the most expensive and the cheapest stuff, foreign food and Chinese vendor food... Need a whole day!"
We were traveling with our friend & his Chinese wife so we had our own guide. If you miss this then your visit to the Forbidden City is less than complete.
"Watch out for guides who promise to give an exclusive guide through the imperial palace, in the end you´ll end up at a tea ceremony where they´ll try to sell off over-priced, bad tea!
When walking the Imperial Palace area I was approached by a guy that called himself Jack, offering me a guided, personalised tour through the imperial palace for 200 Renmimbi. He showed me some parts of the palace, already poitning out he loved drinking Chinese tea. Jack then guided me to the imperial gardens ""to experience a unique Chinese tea ceremony"". Though the tasting on different Chinese teas was informative and tasty, I was forced to purchase overtly overpriced teas after the ceremony, eventually paying 1000 Renmimbi (=140 €) for the tea ceremony and four small portions of tea.
What really bothered me that the tea parlor applied the highest currency conversion rate to my purchase, so I even paid more. So watch out for the tea cermonies in the Imperial Palace area, it´s most likely a scam trying to rip foreign tourists off!"
"Great experience. Was approached before entering by someone offering to guide me through and translate the experience (for a small fee paid at the end). Really helped get a lay of the land and understand what I was seeing. After the ""tour"" I re-explored for another hour or so."
"It's a very huge royal palace I ever seen. A lot of ancient architeture, cultural relics, and beautiful legends all over the place. It's worth visiting"
"We followed doorways and lanes to reach pavillons out of the main block of the palace. They offer great views, a quieter place to explore and a lovely museum of ceramics."
"A must visit in Beijing! This is my 2nd visit and first for my kids - still as amazing as ever. The sheer size and architecture of the palace is just mind boggling with all the different levels of waiting rooms, chambers and courtyards. Leaves one a lasting impression and awe of a past era.....

Getting tickets into the palace was a bit of an experience. Was told that you needed to book online but I had trouble purchasing tickets from the official website - wasn’t able to proceed as it didn’t recognize my foreign mobile number. We went to the museum to try our luck and were fortunate to be able to get tickets as it was winter low season. (There are other sites selling tickets online but we didn’t try).

Couple of things which may help: (1) passport - bring your passport or a photocopy of your passport. This is needed at time of ticket purchase; (2) the vicinity around the Palace is tight security area - taxis can’t stop at the nearby gates and can only stop some distance away (for eg before Tiananmen Square) and you would need to walk the distance (about 15 minutes). Alternatively you can take the subway where the exit is closer to the palace. (3) once inside the palace, the traffic flow is only one way - ie you enter from the front of the palace and exit from the rear at the other end of the palace. Upon exit - there are only 2 shuttle buses to take you back to the front gate where you can again either take the subway or walk through Tiananmen Square to you next destination."
The scale of it all and all the sybolisms and details that went into the design of the entire area is truly amazing. It gives you a glimpse of the benign culture that China lives by.
"No words to describe such a beauty.
It wasn't particularly crowded (it was Friday) so the visit was pleasant.
However, the place is not well curated, very few indications of what you are looking at. The audioguide does not provide enough details.
So, read about the place before your visit!"
Loved the stories behind the city. Was a bit taken aback by the number of people there but it also added to the excitement of being a tourist
"The Forbidden City is a UNESCO World Heritage Site and quite rightly so. It is the world' largest palace complex, containing 980 buildings boasting 9,999 rooms. The whole city is protected by a 32-foot wall, surrounded by a 20-foot moat. Currently known as the Palace Museum, the Forbidden City was the imperial palace during the Ming and Qing Dynasties.
You will see the Imperial Treasures in the palaces and you can explore the beautiful gardens and courtyards in this home to some of China's former rulers. Enjoy !"
Visitors should probably check out this place first before anywhere else due to it's historic significance. Is it spectacular? Not really. Is it crowded? Oh yes.
This is a most amazing place. Our guide was very knowledgeable and really took us back to the time that the forbidden city was inhabited. Shame we couldn’t go into the buildings but understand the government has restored them inside.
Top one of the activity in Beijing. So popular that visitors are extremely limited each day. You have to book an entry with your passeport id.
The Forbidden City is very extensive! Plan at least a half day to see as much as you can. The colors are amazing and the plazas are huge. It can be crowded but it's worth battling through.
"Visited in December, and was very impressed.
A few items to note:
Wind blows through the area in the winter and it can get very cold. Bring some gloves.
Long lines at the main entrance, but you can enter through Zhongshan Park (3RMB). Once inside, it will cost 40RMB to tour the length of the palace.
However, you cannot really walk back to the south, the Forbidden city is one way, for the most part.
If you visit from the airport, take the Airport Express (25RMB). Then take line 2 to line 1 to Tiananman East (4RMB). Download the Beijing Metro app, its helpful, but I could only get English to work on the main map.
If you have checked luggage at the airport you need to transfer, you can drop it at Left Luggage (40RMB)."
"Was not overly impressed with the place. You can't see most of it but from the outside of the buildings, and they all start to look alike after a while. Still, a historic place to visit."
Lots of history to learn about here. It’s a gigantic area with large buildings but we’re not allowed to go into them. Just looked in from the outside.
Large complex of many buildings. Beautiful colors. Seat of imperial power during Ming and Qing Dynasties. UNESCO site. Lots of walking through the area.
"Like everything else in China -It’s huge! Our guide helped to bring to life the history of the Forbidden City though it’s it easy to take it all in. Apparently, it’s closed every Monday so that running repairs, painting and maintenance can be carried out. Consequently, the exteriors look fresh not ancient. As we were there in November, the crowds were manageable."
"A beautiful place which will leave you speechless. The Forbidden City is a window into the past and gives the visitor a greater understanding and appreciation for Chinese culture and history. I would recommend using a tour guide to fully appreciate the site - it is a network of palaces, so there is a lot of information and it is a very big space to navigate. My tour guide was Sarah from Sunny China Tour and she was excellent. She is a licensed tour guide, which allows you to skip lines for tickets and security.

I went to the Forbidden City in December, so it was not crowded and we could move around easily - which made it magical. Just wrap up warm!"
"Forbidden City - home of 24 Chinese emperors, 14 of the Ming dynasty and 10 of the Qing dynasty for five centuries from 1468 to 1911 left us with a sense of awe. This sprawling complex of over 900 buildings would have taken years to build and would have used so much labour.
We entered the complex through the meridian gate and were treated to a magnificent view of the wonderful architecture of the palace buildings with their yellow roofs which only the royals were allowed to have and the eight or nine mythical figurines at the edge of the roof.
There were thousands of visitors thronging the complex, taking pictures, lining up to walk into buildings. Most of them were visitors from other provinces and may be seeing a non-Chinese for the first time. Be prepared to be ogled at by them. Most of them would take our pictures surreptitiously and some would ask to be photographed with us.
It is said that Forbidden City is visited by more than 14 million people annually. It stands as proof of the creativity of the Chinese artisans and the extravagant lifestyle of its ancient emperors.

Ours was a guided tour. It is a must to use a guide as only a few people speak English."
A must see. Right by Tiananmen Square. It was cool to be walk around in the palace that was forbidden to regular people.
"Visiting in winter is cold so take plenty warm clothes and hot drinks. There are a few shops near entrances and exits for drinks & snacks however. The 'restaurant' just inside the tourist entrance (Tian Men) is actually a small fast food cafe, not very enticing.
We did book ahead online and fot succoured into going into the Park of Peoples Culture after listening to a friendly guy who actually just wanted to entice us to see his art. The park is actually lovely and peaceful; a place where folk go just to be or maybe do Ti Chi in a group.
Wear comfortable shoes.
Take your camera.
As anyware in China have toilet tissue as most public toilets dont supply it.
Exits only at 2 places ; the north and eastern gates. Plan accordingly. You will find printing out the map on photo more useful than that on the audioguide
The audio guides are 40Y each but worth it; albeit a little dicky at times. There are guide kiosks in several places within the walls once through the Meridian gate.
Exit via the wall walk to the East gate - the views are well worth it.
Don't skip the Antikythera wreck (86BC) and Mechanism exhibition in the Imperial Garden at the north end of the City. Its a fascinating museum about the findings and examination of the worlds most complex ancient gadget that could reasonably be descibed as the worlds oldest computer. Its incredibly ancient and complex multi geared instrument; completely mind boggling that there was such knowledge so long ago."
"A top must see if un Beijing. The stories behind the city, the architecture the magnificence of the space where a whole city of 6000 people during centuries had their lives sown together. You get to walk the central corridor but the place is so big. Outside the impressive image of Mao welcomes you."
"If you are really into Chinese history, you will probably love this location. I got bored after awhile."
"Beautiful chinese emperor palace that still preserved in good condition. Beautiful and grand architecture shows a reflection of how wealthy during the the the chinese dynasty of Ming and Qing where the emperors has stayed inside this beautiful palace. A huge square and can contains million of people in today context. Can’t assess into their palace like bedroom, hall but can only view from outside. The garden behind is as beautiful! Hard to imagine in thousand years ago such architecture can be built and last till today! Beautiful place to visit if you come to Beijing visit."
"Packed with tourists mostly in groups.

After a while, all buildings look more or less the same.

Be prepare to walk a distance to the entrance."
I would say you shouldn’t miss this place it so majestic and beautiful I really loved this from the entrance those big red doors I just remembered Karate kid where Jaden Smith touched each every ball which was on the door for good fortune. Would you believe I was going crazy doing the same. It’s huge and massive so it’s worth till the end to watch.
"Although it was a pleasant trip we got to see lot of wonderful things Beijing had to offer, but we were extremely disappointed by the unfriendly attitude of the cab drivers and even the folks on the road would stop their car and would offer to drop you for $100.00 I found it very disturbing.
If you are causing and end up in Beijing make sure that you arrange your taxi in advance as I found that most of the taxis would try to rob you as most of them would get together and ask you the same price which is lot more expensive for a very crabby looking taxi.
word of caution is take a buss to the Beijing our their are trains you can take but unfortunate part is most of the cruise passengers have way to many bags to carry and port has not provided any meaningful resource that you feel comfortable with it.
I think the best option is to book a big SUV in advance and offer to provide ride to cruise passengers and share the tab .... that we you will have a reliable clean decent looking cab.
cab drivers haggle a lot, they will ask you crazy price and at some point you get so tired that you don't even want to take a cab.... it is very irritating if you are not used to haggling so we always opted for the hotel car although it was double the cost but better to have peace of mind.
Although Beijing is safe but you will find many who are ready to steal your purse so be cautious alert..... Always keep your bag in-front of you wallet in front pocket and enjoy the forbidden city!
You can use your credit card to pay the entrance fee at the forbidden city, sound system if you rent is slightly expensive and does not work 50% of the time so you will have return it and get a new one..."
"The Forbidden City is famous in Beijing and recognized around the world. We did not partake in the tour but we did visit all the public areas that are free, just like the rest of the people but skipped anything requiring entrance fees. This area is huge as its almost like the center of Beijing. Traffic, crowds, hot weather and lots of security every where. Here you can find many souvenirs you would expect from Mao Zedong hats, flags, and memorabilia just to get your tourist dollar. You could spend over five hours in there because you have a famous park, The Palace museum, Tienanmen Square, Mao's mausoleum, etc here. Line ups are long and crowded but that is because traffic and entrances are heavily guarded.
All foreign tourists be aware: Expect long walks unless you pay for the go karts inside to ferry you around at a cost, and bring your passports with you. No passports, no entrance. It would feel like a kick in the rear end if you lined up for so long, and spent money on transport only to be turned away because security needed to verify your passport. Local Chinese bring their IDs. And if there are any ladies trying to sell you China flags or souvenirs while you are lining up, those are way cheaper priced than inside. After you exit The Forbidden City, you will pass by many Hutongs. Those are homes and stores that have been there a very long time. Step inside a store to buy a drink and get a good glimpse into the past. Its an actual living museum. Expect to spend more money for things but that is a business after all."
"Great place to visit... majestic, very impressed by it’s dimension. A place full of history that should be visited, mandatory!!!"
"This was absolutely amazing! An absolute must. Make sure you get the audioguide, it is incredibly informative. I'd rather do that than have an actual guide. It was great to be able to take our time and see what we wanted. I highly recommend the add on features like the clock exhibit and the Nine Dragon Screen!"
What a place! Amazing history and fantastic set up with the personal audio guide in any language. Leave a full day to explore this amazing site!!
The City is really sprawling and huge. We barely scratched the surface in our two hour tour. It was amazing and well maintained.
"Though crowded with lots of visitors, the Forbidden city is indeed a great place to visit, witness the life styles of erstwhile kings and emperors. The huge hallways and spacious courtyards make for a good walk and a memorable experience."
"This is a beautiful and huge site. The best part of our visit to Beijing along with the Great Wall. Definitely, recommend renting an audio tour, because every small corner of the site has a lot of history. We bought our tickets in advance online at the site's official website. We were glad we did so because there were long lines to get the tickets. The place was by no means empty but it wasn't too crowded and we were able to take it all in and take some good pictures. There's plenty to see, but a two-hour tour should give you enough time to see a good part of the Forbidden City."
"The forbidden city is a mist see while in Beijing. If you have time, then simply take the metro or a cab to the entrance. Do yourself a favor and rent the audio guide at the gate it does help to give history and perspective. Do plan a lot of time if you like visiting each temple, exhibit and special rooms. The gift shop is also quite nice and we got a few cute gifts here. It's a lot of walking, wear comfortable shoes!"
"This is just stunning. Even with many people around you, you can still enjoy the immensity of the place. Take time to visit all the different parts of the Forbidden City and take an audio guide at the entrance to have a better understanding of the place. Be ready for heavy security check."
"We had to visit the Forbidden City on our trip to Beijing. We had a major hiccup with our tour company and since it was during the October holiday, there was no way we could go on our own as the tickets had been sold out for weeks, but thankfully all was resolved. The crowds were indescribable during that period but it was still an incredible experience. The history of the place is just so interesting to learn about. If you don't have a tour guide, rent an audio tour."
"highly recommended, well preserved, colorful. I wish there were inside furnished rooms you could visit."
"We went on a Beijing layover tour and spent a couple of hours in the Forbidden City - I was really glad to have a guide as he explained the history and culture, and also directed us efficiently!"
"Beautiful place, especially at sunset, when the golden roofs reflect the sun's rays. It was crowded, but less crowded than expected and really huge. Enough space to just stroll around and enjoy the day."
"Only one word to describe this place. Huge! And it's really really extremely huge. Maybe I have been watching Chinese drama since I was young. The forbidden palace had occurred in many dramas and it doesn't seems anything new to me. Just that now, I got to see it with my own eyes. Nothing special but HUGE! So, be prepared to do a lot of walking. You might need a whole day to cover every corner which is open to public."
On a tour we visited Tiananmen Square and the Forbidden City. It's another must for travellers to Beijing. We could not get over the size of Tiananmen Square and the Forbidden City. Once we entered the Forbidden City it just seemed to go on forever. Incredible construction. We are thrilled to have seen such a place
"Sorry to see the difference to earlier visits, but the tourist masses make an easy stroll impossible. Pushing and shoving is now on the agenda and even tour guides have problems to find their customers."
To see this place you need couple of days to look into the main routes middle right left and off shoots into little streets with shops or mini museums. Lots of walking lots of steps.
We met with your tour guide. Lisa . Lisa was really friendly and gave us a lot of information about this fabulous place. She is really nice and kept us in front of all the lines. She knows this place and believe me you wont be in lines . And I can tell you the day we went their were a lot of school groups really crowded. Lisa is the best for the Forbidden City skip the lines tours.
"We loved visiting the Forbidden City which was right outside of Tianamen Square in Beijing. It's a beautiful former home of the ancient emperor and their hundreds of concubines- wives. It's a national treasure within China and a very popular tourist spot for the Chinese. As Americans , we were definitely the minority and were surrounded by friendly chinese who wanted to take our pictures!"
"Go later in the afternoon !!!

One of the most incredible palaces I have ever seen or read about !

We missed getting tickets first thing which turned out to be a good thing as going later in the afternoon the crowds had diminished and it was slightly cooler.

We saw more in less time and got much better photos. We also got to slowly wander out through the gardens."
"Absolutely huge!! Wear good walking shoes and prepare to spend at least a few hours if you can. Some of the areas are repetitive, but worth seeing to appreciate the true magnitude of this compound.

This is a must see if you stop in Bejing, but those with mobility impairments may find even taking a short tour too much, as the compound is just that large.

Well worth the visit, but prepare to take a time out afterwards. My wife and I walked almost the full compound, and then caught a flight out to Saigon. Took us a day and a half to recover afterwards, and proved a little much before the flight."
This is such a big place it was good to have guide to explain the history etc I went in November good time as not masses and masses of people
"We were on a group tour of Beijing and did not have time to visit the actual Museum here, but we did spend over 2 hours in the Forbidden City... another 2 hours might have been useful.

This City is massive and gorgeous. You cannot enter 95% oft he buildings, however."
"I visited this as part of a China tour (it was an add on), if this is your situation you may want to do it on your own and not with the group. The city is enormous and you could easily spend hours wondering the grounds. The pieces I saw were really beautiful and I learned a lot from the guide, but I think lonely planet and an audio guide would be just fine. My tour only provided about 3hrs total and with all the stopping I didn’t see as much as I would like. But it’s definitely worth a visit."
You should spend a lot of time there. Everything is beautiful and there’s a lot of history there. I recommend going early in the morning due to high temperatures.
"Crowds were a bit intimidating initially, but got dispersed after sometime. Huge complex, many interesting spots, friendly staff, provides a good overview of history. The audio equipment did not work, so i suggest not to waste money on it. Do not forget your passports, because the tickets are tied to it."
"Even though the masses of people were astounding, the experience was one of a kind. I recommend you go with a tour guide to get the maximum benefit."
"My Glory of China Tour and Yangtze River Cruise included visiting the Forbidden City, but I wan't prepared for how big and wonderful it is! Jing was our Intertrips tour guide and because Beijing is her home and she provided a wealth of information.
China was never on my Bucket List, but now and because of this trip, it is at the top of my list of Favorite Places I've traveled to!"
"I visited in October which was good because it was off-peak but bad because I saw it on a Sunday when it was packed out with local people..
The whole complex is massive and you cant help but be impressed by it (I kept visualising the film ""The Last Emperor"" as I walked through).
In some aspects it can and was disappointing - though there are lots of separate palace buildings many are very similar and mostly there is nothing much to see inside them as most are closed - Chiang Kai-shek took most of the valuables when his armies retreated to occupy Taiwan.
Nonetheless it is a seriously important and iconic place to visit - a must-see place in Beijing."
"It was off peak season when we visited (November). Good number of visitors, not too crowded. Some special exhibits gets a little crowded but a little push and tug and you'll get there eventually.. Wouldn't dream of visiting it during peak seasons though.

Worth a visit. Bring a history book or audio guide to learn more about the place, or just walk thru it all and enjoy the architecture"
"Iconic place, historical though, educational vacation, very good, and quiet clean, but crowded.. but its ok, i love it all"
"Having heard so much about this place, it was a bit underwhelming in real life. Lots of buildings. The mostly all look alike. You can’t go inside. The lines to peek inside are big. And not really lines. You need to jostle your way to the front if you want to peek in. Iconic place, so worth a visit, just because of what it is."
"This place is huge!! Make sure to bring your passport and that it is closed on Mondays

It will always be crowded regardless of day, and time you visit. Make sure you carve out at least half a day when visiting because it's massive and walking from place to place takes time. You can bring in snacks and water. My friends and I went without a guide as there are English posts for the major part"
"I was part of a tour group when we visited and we were lucky with a very knowledgeable tour leader who saved us time by taking us away from crowds an yet pointing out all the salient things to see .

This historical complex , the seat of the emperor of China and their households for almost 500 Years , spanning many dynasties is vast and impossible to cover in a day . Huge courtyards and impressive ornate buildings . You get a sense of the history of China by walking and looking at the many buildings in this amazing complex .

I found peering through the glass windows to look at the very long emperor’s bed interesting .

Not to be missed is the imperial gardens north of this complex. The last boy emperor Puyi of the Qing dynasty worked as gardener in his own palace .

I recommend a minimum 3 hours . Must see if you are a visitor to Beijing ."
"Very good attraction to visit, is close on Mondays; there are plenty to walk and to see. The surrounding area is so nice, with stores, restaurants, coffee places...the scenery is amazing!!"
Take extra memory cards for your camera! This palace is beautiful and filled with cultural and historical artifacts and sights. You will not regret a minute of time spent here.
"if you are interested in ancient history or historical sites. you will love this place. a huge palace compound with lots to see. lovely architecture, rooms.
especially loved the queen and concubine's chambers. lovely stuffs were kept to see how it used to be in those times.
now comes the big BUT... its very crowded and what i got to know from my guide ALWAYS!!! like at no time are there fewer crowds, so like you can see it properly at your leisure. i was literally pushed, shoved. when i tried to see through the glass inside the queen's chambers i could not get out as the crowd, simply wouldnt stop pushing. including the long day, with so much walking with pushing and lots of crowds. its so frustating.
so what i was expecting as the highlights of my beijing trip turned into a disappointment.
atlast my guide told me, that the place is usually less crowded in the winters when usually its very cold in beijing or snows. maybe i need to revisit it in a winter again to appreciate it well.
be prepared to handle the crowds whenever you go."
This needs to be seen to be appreciated. I arrived right at 8:30am so no line ups to get in and plenty of room to explore
"This is an historical place. Too bad the Chinese won't talk about what happened here.
Be prepared to walk for miles, as this place just keeps on going.
Not to be missed when in Beiging."
"This site is a must, as our guide stated – ""It is the heart of China"". It is very interesting and beautiful.
However the place is flooded with tourists (most of them are Chinese). I visited the place on November which is considered to be off-season, and I don't want to think what goes on here during the summer.
You keep moving in the area in a continuous river of visitors, without the ability to really absorb and appreciate the place.
I certainly recommend a visit here – but don't plan to stay here more than 2 hours."
Large and elaborate and beautiful. Bring toilet paper and hand sanitizer. Stunning - take lots of pictures.
"Must see place, spectacular palace of former Chinese emperors with hundreds of smaller and larger buildings ending with nice garden.
Can be very crowded so avoid top touristic season months (visit early spring or late autumn)
It’s a pity that interiors of palace cannot be visited, other then behind bars or glass windows.
Historic artefacts or pictures are not on display
Nevertheless impressive"
An absolute must see in Beijing. It is magnificent. Could be slightly better sign posted once inside to make it perfect. I tried to find the 9 dragons and went round in circles without finding them. Anyway it was still lovely to wander around this magnificent palace and the weather was picture perfect.
"The Forbidden City is near to Tiananmen Square. This place can be reach by subway Line 1, get off at Tiananmen East station. I loved this place and a must see when visit Beijing. There is so many old Chinese culture an architectural building and beautiful. It's amazing!
For foreigner, there is a place on the right-hand side corner before the entrance to purchase the ticket. passport is required as they will serves as a ticket."
"A must see when you travel to China. So many very old buildings and art from the Chinese culture. Worth taking a few hours or possibly all day to visit. We just walked around on our own and viewed the sights, you don’t really need a tour guide."
"First time visiting the site alone and it’s still very enjoyable. November is the off peak period but it can still be crowded in certain parts of this “City”. As a foreigner, it is best to purchase your tickets online to avoid the long lines. Your passport serves as the ticket for all the 3 entrances that requires tickets. Just hand the guards at these entrances your passport and they will scan them and you can be on your way to enjoy the exhibits in museum. I opted for the electronic guide as I wanted to walk around at my own pace. It offers sufficient information to keep me interested to explore the many buildings. The palace is an architectural wonder and thus, one should also pay attention to the interesting details hidden amongst the building. For example, the numbers of creatures lined up along the edge of the roofs is an indication of how important the building is. Remember to schedule at least half a day for this beautiful palace. The quality of food had improved since I last visited over a decade ago but the lines and seats may be a problem if one visits during the peak period. Finally, remember to wear comfortable shoes as it is a very large complex. Enjoy it, I had a great time today!"
"Forbidden City, This place was cool to see in person and it’s huge it’s much larger in person than you could imaging. Close to Tiananmen Square and museums. I’m not a tour guide person, but if you can find someone to tell you about the history while strolling through this place I would say do that!"
"Entrance fee of RMB40. Don’t bother to arrange day tour with tour agency. Just grab a DiDi transport and just enjoy your day there. For foreigner, please remember to bring your passport, in order to purchase the entrance ticket.

The time spent varies with individual.
As there are many palaces, you can spend whole day or only 2-3 hours depending on the speed of walking and photo taking. For us, we are bored after 2 hours as everything look identical."
Another of Beijing’s highlights and you mustn’t miss it no matter what or how tired you are. There’s plenty to see and record on your camera or phone
"This was the main imperial palace of the Ming and Qing dynasties (1420 to 1911). The grounds complex are massive with 980 buildings (with just under 10,000 rooms) and other structures spread over 72 hectares. Average daily visitors approximate 70,000 to 85,000 in high-season and 20,000 to 35,000 in the off-season. On the back portion of the grounds, there are many carefully crafted beautiful trees, many being hundreds of years old.

It took a while to enter, as police were checking the identification papers of some Chinese citizens.

OMG. Why so few reviews on Forbidden City? At the time of writing, Charles Bridge of Prague had 63,507 reviews on TripAdvisor, and Forbidden City 12,683 reviews. Both have a 4.5-star TripAdvisor rating. Although I rate both as Excellent, from the standpoint of overall world significance, I would give Charles Bridge a rating of 3 and Forbidden City 10 out of 10, with ten being the best. Maybe it is because fewer Chinese write reviews."
"I booked a four hour walking tour for half a day. Its quite a must do, but on the day of my visit, there was a vip delegation to forbidden city, thus half the forbidden city is cordoned off for the vip. With The public occupying the other half of forbidden city is almost impossible to enjoy the site. Fortunate thing is i did a 4-5 hour tour instead of the 2-3 hours. That allowed me to take my time and stroll around to the less crowded part of forbidden city."
"The Palace is one of many venues within the Forbidden City. Though the site is small, the collection more than compensates, including statues of Buddha dated from the Sixth Century A.D. Bring your walking shoes, but do visit."
"When I convinced my friend to take a 72 hour trip with me from SE Wisconsin to Beijing he thought, this is crazy. The Forbidden City is one of a handful of reasons I chose Beijing this year for my 72 and it was breathtaking from the moment you enter. American history is neat, but I'll admit Chinese history is inspiring and leaves you in awe, particularly when it's the architecture and context of how their nation governed. I generally am anti-guide, I like to research it and do it on my own. This is one time I would recommend and encourage the guide service. A visit here is easily combined with Tiananmen Square prior and a visit to the Great Wall after.

Why I would recommend the guide service - they will keep you moving along, get you through security with minimum confusion, and point out the more pertinent areas of interest. Security within the grounds is more present vs. many American locations, but understandable here. There is no shortage of bathrooms, vendors, places to sit (or stand) and take it all in. If you find yourself in Beijing, I would definitely recommend this bucket list destination. The photos below speak for themselves, and leaving here was one of those ""there's never enough time."""
"We had no idea how big the complex is. Get there as early as you can to avoid the hoards or crowds.
We used the metro as transport there and that worked well
The audio guide was good if you weren’t on a tour."
"We would recomend getting a guide and pay to skip the lines. Our guide Lisa was great and it was a beautiful day, so she also took us to the park across from the forbidden city and we climbed up to the top, where you could look down on the forbidden city! The views were amazing! She also negotiated our cab ride back to our hotel for us, so that we weren't taken advantage of!"
"I came by foot since I lived close to Forbidden City and chose to enter from the south gate (Tiananmen Square). Was a Sunday so I could say it was quite crowded, mostly Chinese tourists. but didn't have to stay in line more than 2-3 min. even for the tickets. Ticket cost was 40 CNY (November period). There is plenty to see inside the city, but also make sure you read a little bit about it before coming, if you chose no guide / audioguide option. Plenty of toilets and souvenir shops.

Make sure you are going also to Jingshan Park (north from Forbidden City) as you can have the whole city from above, only 2 CNY entrance."
"This like transfering through a gigantic subway station on rush hour, only it has grandiose Chinese architecture, mostly reconstructed. Better watch it in The Last Emperor."
"Amazing place to see, lots of history and a huge place to visit. Lots of walking. Wear comfortable shoes, clothes and a hat."
Wow mark that off the bucket list. Truly amazing was in awe the whole time. Even with the intense crowds pushing the you around. Oct is a great time not hot at all. So beautifully taken care of and restored a credit to the people of China.
"Well, for starters, I have expected that the place would be crowded, but I still loved our visit. This is one of the places I have long wanted to visit, and the place was so majestic."
"We loved the Forbidden City - it was so much larger than we expected, a beautifully cared for. Our guide, Lucky, was incredibly knowledgeable and provided so much historical and cultural context. We spent about three hours here. We could have spent longer, just admiring the details of the buildings, hearing about the various dynasties and emperors (and 1 empress!). I highly recommend."
"Wow...Wow.... and Wow ... You can keep on Wowing this historically rich, achitecturally breathtaking expanse of Chises Imperialism"
"Great place to go and see a piece of Chinese history, plenty of information around if you haven’t read up before hand. Bit disappointing that you can’t go in to the rooms and see what they would have looked like. You can only peer in to a few. Would recommend going out of season as it is still busy then so must be crazy during peak season."
This place is huge. not recommended if you can't walk very far. But if you can get a wheelchair then its a must see.
You do not understand the scale until you walk through the whole complex! Amazing buildings and history. Thanks China Highlights and Nancy our Guide!!
"I learned so much here due to our amazing guide Jason. He took us all through the forbidden city and shared the ancient history of China. This is worth a visit when you’re in the area. The rain slowed us down a bit. We were a large group of 20 and had a good time, walking learning, listening and taking pictures!"
The history of the palace is amazing. So much intrigue within the royal court. A wonderful stop during a long layover.
"One problem for tourists in Beijing is that many of the attractions have the same colors, designs and architecture. We had visited the Temple of Heaven with a guide the day before, and many of the buildings looked almost identical to the ones in the Forbidden City. That being said, the Forbidden City is a massive complex, and we enjoyed walking through it. The clock museum there is worth the extra fee, and the gardens at the end are very pretty. Be sure to notice the ceilings in the garden pavilions. Some of the easiest designs in the city. I don't know that a guide is necessary. If I had it to do over, I would have googled the info and gone on our own. There are good maps there to tell you what each building is. The walk is not hard. We were extremely lucky with good weather and it was not too crowded the day we went. I HIGHLY recommend paying a small fee to get into the huge Zhongshan Park next door. It was the highlight of my trip to see the locals (mostly retirees) socializing and enjoying ribbon dancing, singing under a pavilion (a group of 40 or so who come daily), playing a rousing game similar to hackensack (they are very good and entertaining to watch, especially considering the people were 55+!), and tai chi. We hiked to the pavilions at the very top and the most beautiful view of Beijing rewarded us! You could see all of the Forbidden City from above and the White Pagoda at a distance. Really good place for a sunset view and pictures on a clear day. There were snacks, drinks and souvenirs available near the top. This hike would be difficult for someone with knee problems. I loved it though!"
"This UNESCO World Heritage Site is the former chinese imperial palace for over 500 years ago. This complex is so huge with many buildings on it. The architechture here is very unique and beautiful. Many people visit this complex including local too. Interestingly, there are two big lion statues in front of one of the building here as if it were guardian of the building. Honestly, trip to Beijing incomplete without visiting this palace."
"The forbidden Palace is a ticketed antrance and limited daily tickets . I would recommend a tour to help you navigate the palace . There is very limited signage to understand what you are viewing . Most of the furniture and palace items are stored in the national museum . I would recommend about an hour and a half to walk through the palace . It is duplicative so you don’t have to spend as much time in the second half . There are bathrooms both outside the palace and inside . If you can wait , the bathrooms inside are much better . There are photographers outside the front of the palace that take pictures and put them in a souvenir booklet for a reasonable fee ."
"This is a place with so much history you can easily be overwhelmed. The physical place is huge, it goes on and on. Be prepared to go up and down steps again and again. My only disappointment was how few of the buildings have much you can actually see. An unexpected opportunity was to dress in the elegant clothing of the period and have your photo taken."
"We 3 of us joined this private tour to forbidden city with tour guide name Cactus. She is helpful knowledgeable n kind. Patient with us taking pictures for us n bringing us to every corner in Forbidden City !. Took time to explain to us n also communicated with our driver where to pick n drop us. Also advised us of place to eat best peking duck n to shop.
I wud recommend Cactus to everyone who visit Beijing."
"the forbidden city is really an amazing palace! after visiting a few other palaces around the world, it is really a unique experience. the place is splendid and huge! take a few hours to tour around in order to fully appreciate it."
Forbidden City is the most important place in China. It is in heart of Beijing. You need to spend minimum 3-4 hours for this visit. Entrance fee is 40 RMB (~6 USD). You can get audio guide and it really helps you in this visit.
"Great weather, a little chilly, not many people, have someone that can explain all of it (guide). Lots of walking, take confortable shoes."
"Very good introduction to the historical aspects of China. Huge walking tour with series of seemingly-identical structures one-after the other. Recommended to buy the ticket online (for non-Chinese ask the hotel staff/friend; check the prices online for the season).
Recommend to get electronic walking translator (though expensive for the time and information). Takes over 2 hours for a comfortable walk, though crowded due to local and international visitors."
"It just kept going - and going - and going. We'd go from one courtyard to the next, each as large as the prior. It seemed it would never end. Without a tour guide it wouldn't have been nearly as interesting so I would suggest a tour of these places to be told the history, the stories and the legends."
"It is an actual city! It may not seem like it from the outside, but it is a huge complex of buildings and temples and it is worth really dedicating it the whole day, if possible!

Go there early in the morning to avoid the crowds of people :)"
"Leave 2-3 hours at least to fully explore this remarkable historic site. Entrance through South Gate, then follow crowds as you make your way north through each successive courtyard and palace. You will exit through North Gate."
"There is so much to see in the Forbidden city that one probably needs a day to do it properly. There are endless courtyards, all of which looked beautiful in the sun, and without the crowds would be very restful.
The museum contains paintings,antiquities,ceramics and calligraphy of the Imperial collections and is one of the best in China."
The historical significance of this palace is hard to take in. The artifacts and the immensity of the structure are amazing. A must see when in Beijing. I did not take a tour but found it very fascinating just viewing what was there to see. There are informative signs throughout.
We have just returned from a guided tour of China and the Forbidden city was the first attraction we visited. Pictures do not do this immense complex justice. True lovers of history will revel in the explanations and stories imparted by the guides and the chance to follow in the steps of the Emperor's. The attention to detail and balance is to be seen to be believed.
"Most of the organized tours take you around to hit the highlights in about an hour or so. Don't do that! Take your time and really spend some time to absorb and enjoy everything. Be sure to wear good walking shoes. We went in late October and the crowds were not as bad. Our Guide, Smile, took us to some of the areas where the organized tours don't go - had some stunning views! At times it almost felt like we were the only ones there. How she managed that I will never know! It was fantastic."
"I think everybody who goes to Beijing visiting this place. There is mo more needed, it must be seen."
"This place was a true picture of the ancient history of China, it shows how the ancient emperor rulled the and how the people respect him."
"This is one of those places that you have to see but unfortunately you can't see it. You can walk around the complex but you are not allowed into the buildings. I believe that their are two buildings not included in the general admission that you might be able to enter but that's it.

See it to say you saw it but don't expect too much"
It was very crowded but we had an excellent guide to navigate through the large complex and who pointed out all the key things to see. The gardens looking down on the forbidden city were really nice as well.
Unfortunately the only day we could visit was on one of the hottest days of the year. Wear comfortable shoes as you'll do a lot of walking. The sites will make you want to go back and re-see some of the movies made at this historic site. Plan your trip well and give yourself time to get out the same exit you came in at (if that is important). Unfortunately we were coming out at closing and had to take many detours to get out because gates were closed. Not enjoyable when you have spent most of the day out in hot weather. Also would suggest a hat and sunscreen.
"It was interesting to visit this site but one is tempted to note that ""if you've seen one temple and then a second temple and then a third temple you've seen them all"". Purists would not agree and maybe it was just the massive number of tourists in the area when we were there."
"It is a place full of history. The Forbidden City was home to more than 20 emperors of two Chinese dynasties, Ming and Qing. Its palaces are filled with histories and the architecture is magnificent. If you have the chance, go with a guide."
"If you are getting a guide, give him your particulars (passport particulars, etc.) in advance so that he/she can book the tickets and make arrangements in advance. Then, remember to bring along your passport for the tour to the Forbidden City. They check your passports before the advance tickets are issue."
"It has such an interesting history, and is the must see place in Beijing. Spent quite a few hours there and did not see everything. Also go on a weekday, but its size means the crowds are not too bad during the week."
"The forbidden city rakes in 80,000 visitors a day for a reason. The size, complexity of the buildings and sheer magnificence of the lawns would have you captivated for hours.
Some tips:
- Book your ticket online, this can save you valuable time.
- At the meridian gate, there are 2 `Ticket Checking` queues, make sure you opt for the one at the RIGHT and NOT the left.
- Pick a weekday"
"We just had a walk through tour from one end to the other on our day trip of Beijing but you could have spent hours here visiting all the museums in the City. We literally walked 'The Centre Line' and had photo opportunites, this place is never quiet but had the chance of some good photos. A must-see place in Beijing."
"The forbidden city looks beautiful and has great historic significance. We walked around with an audio guide for 2-3 hours and had a great time. Worth doing a weather check since it is an open air walk, best to go there on a sunny day or have an umbrella handy"
"A must see while visiting Beijing as you don’t know when you may return to this great city. Everyday, tens of thousands of Chinese and international tourists flock here to see this square"
"Great place to visit to in November when it is less crowded. Most interesting museum is the timepiece museum where the historical mater pieces were displayed. I wish the name plates on the displays could be updated with bigger text and more information, otherwise this place would score 10/10."
"Although we didn't purchase anything, we were impressed with the creativity and seeming quality and variety in the Palace Museum."
Visited here in early October as part of a group of 14 starting in Tiananmen Square from where you enter the city. To say it is huge is an understatement. The buildings are impressive but unfortunately inside access is not allowed so you really see a large number of similar buildings over a huge area. It would be a good idea to read about the city prior to visiting as our local guide rushed through explanations in broken English and no handouts were given. I found the sheer size of it overwhelming along with the 1000’s of other Chinese tourists also visiting and scuttling/pushing everywhere. The best was the gardens at the back but we had little to no time to appreciate them as after our allotted time we were ushered to get back to the bus. Very little seating is available if you wish to have a rest.
Building in Forbidden City are beautiful. That is mostly what you see are the structures. The most popular place in Beijing for tourists. Be prepared for long lines and masses of people.
"We arrived and bought tickets at the door. You have to look for the ticket window off to the right side when you enter the main gate. They also have audio guides you can rent for 20 RMB. In retrospect I would have preferred a guide as the audio guide is quite brief and sometimes difficult to manage. However, the place is amazing and so much more vast than I would have imagined. I wish we could have seen more rooms as you only get to see a few interiors. I would recommend bringing food as the options are limited and usually quite busy. Also if it's chilly or sunny dress appropriately. It can get quite chilly and windy inside and I'm sure hot in the summer. A must see in Beijing!"
The forbidden palace is huge and there is a crush of people. It is amazing that furniture and other objects have endured intact. It provides a glimpse of imperial life centuries ago.
We hired a guide at the entrance which is a must. Tina had a good grasp of English and was great sharing the history and awesome features of this ancient site. A must visit when in Beijing.
"Such a vast, enormous place to visit.With over 600 rooms, It went on and on, as far as the eye could see. So many little alleys and areas to explore. Not all rooms are available to get into? more were closed. Can get very very crowded during peak hours, so try to go when visitors are less in number. Also please make sure to wear good cushioned comfortable footwear, as there are a lot of walking involved..Be wary of high drops, some stairways have large gaps which someone could fall and sustain serious injuries. Was a lovely place to visit, read up on the history before you go..."
"Reading reviews will not prepare you for how big this place is. Reputed to have over 9000 rooms nestled in 250 acres. Bring water good shoes and swat up on your Chinese history so you have a better appreciation of what you are seeing.

3 hours of exploration is generally enough for most people, though to extend your endurance an escape into the less crowded garden areas will fortify your weariness and mental space. There is little options for food, though there are some vending machines with water and the occasional stall selling icecream. Come prepared with a small backpack for water and snacks.

We arrived at opening time at 8.30, along with every tour group in Beijing. Unless you gave a chinese friend or are on a tour, you cannot prebook tickets . Only 80k are issued for the day and though that may sound alot, once you see the lines you will quickly realise an early start in the day is the only way you’ll get in.

While the crowds can be oppressive, once you escape into the labyrinth of rooms, time will stop and its possible to explore alot on your own.

There are a number of special exhibits within the Forbidden City which is worth the extra few dollars. Most of the exhibits have some English explanation attached. The self guided tour headset is worth hiring as its not too wordy or tediously detailed.

Exiting can be an interesting activity as it is not near the entrance- but halfway up the palace walls. There are small buses running regularly to take you back to the entrance for under $1 each.

Worth pacing yourself and spending the day."
Forbidden City is the largest imperial palace. As the name implies ordinary people before cannot enter without permission. This tourist spot is one of the main attractions in Beijing so expect that it’s crowded. You can buy the ticket at the kiosk near the gate and just bring your passport with you. If your not with any tour guide it’s advisable to rent an audio guide so you will appreciate the history and indeed it’s very interest. I would suggest to a lot 4-5 hrs in this place and you have to have comfortable shoes and clothes as it involves a lot of walking.
"I spent a few hours viewing the forbidden city. It is quite large so allow some time to explore properly. I found it fascinating and took plenty of photos. You can buy refreshments inside, but I would recommend taking your own. 2 minor gripes: 1) it was quite confusing working out how to buy an entry ticket if not using an app. It turned out there was a small kiosk to the right of the main entry barriers where you queue up and pay (must have your passport too!) 2) my audio guide seemed to only work intermitently - was interestingy when it did work!"
Through the years China has endured a history that went through many Rulers. Each leader added to the marvel of China as a Dynasty. If you enjoy historical facts visit this location.
A must see if you visit China. The place is enormous. Have a good pair of shoes. Carry a good camera for taking beautiful pictures. Go prepared with the history of the place to understated it better.No 1 of the three ancient sites in Beijing Be prepared to encounter really huge crowds. A morning is sufficient to view the place as many sections not open to the public.
i’ve never seen such a big palace in my life. it took 4 hours just to visit the half of it and the treasure part. Totally must see place.
It really is huge. My friend and I put aside a whole day at the palace. Pre book your tickets is the best advice I can give. And include the Palace Museum in those. It's worth a look.
"While visiting the Forbidden City during mid week in October it was very congested and hard to get around in the tour group of 33 people we were with. The architecture and history is amazing but brace yourself for about 30,000 people at any given time"
"Hard to see this incredible landmark in the 3 hours we had there, so wish we had longer! The history here and the beautiful architecture is amazing. A real treasure to visit. Be prepared for crowds and lots of walking as this place is enormous! Find the hidden rooms and spots away from the crowds and you will have a great experience."
I went to Beijing for a day while in China and visited the Forbidden City. One word - WOW! So many amazing articles to see. The history is simple incredible.
"The Forbidden City is incredibly impressive if you don’t mind being there with 10,000 of your friends. It is an incredible area with palaces, gardens, sculpture and buildings that was only used by the emperor his wife’s,concubines, court members and other palace people. It is a marvel to see and as you travel through the many gates you are absolutely impressed with the scale of it all. It can be busy on any day of the week with people lined up in long ques to get through each gate within the city."
"A beautiful place to visit for someone visiting Beijing China and the Forbidden city. I took almost 50 pictures visiting the forbidden city, it has over 999 room in the surrounding building."
"Well it was kinda boring but then again we didnt have a guide at all and just walked around. The real stupid thing about it is that once you go in the entrance from Tiananmen sq, you cant go back that way to get out, you have to walk all the way down S. Chizi st to get back to W. Chang'an ave."
"The place is so huge and lots of colorful arts on the ceilings, roof eves, columns,etc. This is the original crazy rich asian."
"very impressive area and heaps of history just in front of the viewer.we went there and just walked around but lineup for Mao's tomb was very long.As it is open area a good hat or umbrella is needed and plenty of bottled water.Summer would be hot [very] but autumn is right time to go,"
"The palace is really interesting and the audio guide is good (when it works). When we went there it wasn't necessary to buy tickets in advance online as some unofficial guide tried to tell us. We just stood in line for a 10 minutes - it would have been quicker but a person in front of us didn't remember to bring their passport. The palace is so big it can take a long time to walk all around it, it was having some maintenance done when we visited and was looking a little worn here and there - but overall it is amazing."
"If you want to grasp the might of imperial China, Forbidden city is right place to start. Lot of buildings and huge yards, located in downtown Beijing"
I had no idea how long this complex was. It will wear you out but is a must do when in Beijing. If you have a guide you can avoid the long entrance line. Vivie Tours is who we used and her knowledge and assistance on what to focus on was great!
"From crossing Tienanmen square, to walking around the forbidden city takes a few hours . ok if you have a guide with you to explain everything."
It is one of the sightseeing spots you shoud visit but it is mostly full of hundreds of visitors. It is a really crowdy place.
"If you have never been to the Forbidden City, please consider that this place is HUGE. It's beautiful and fascinating, and you need to plan hiking shoes and at least half a day if you want to see it all (we should have planned a full day). There are so many side areas and extra things to see that you could easily just wander around looking at everything for hours and hours. Plus, be prepared for what feels like the entire population of China to join you in there. Soooo many people. There are automated audio tours you can rent (which we did not do). It's simply something that looks like a plastic square with earphones that lots of people were walking around with. I'd also recommend watching a documentary or two on Youtube before going to the Forbidden City. It will make the experience that much more exciting if you already know the history of what you see there. It's definitely a 'must see' for a reason."
We were transported to another time by the excellent expose of history made by our guide. We were able to feel the restrictions that had been at the Forbidden City in ancient times . We understood what happened there and why. The Dynasty was protecting itself. You should visit this historic place.
"I was looking forward to the Forbidden City. It was a little disappointing. The buildings are spectacular, the exteriors are gorgeous. The disappointment was there was almost no interiors to view. A few buildings were closed, so its possible we just missed some interiors because of renovation. I was just hoping to see rooms where the emperor used to use, but it wasnt to be. So I think its worth a visit, but as an important historical sight, interiors should be included and so it could be better."
"We have the opportunity to visit capital city of China.
We hire a private tour guide arranged by our Hotel Concierge. our guide graduate from
WuHan University master in English.his introduction of the Forbidden City history is absolutely educational and joyful.
If Budget allow private tour guide would be highly recommended.
Very important to wear comfortable Footwear.

Be alert.
Every corner is packed with people be careful with your personal belonging.
Try to visit forbidden city as early as possible from the morning.
It's definitely almost a full day tour."
"I truly enjoyed visiting the Forbidden City during my travels to Beijing! China has such a rich history and you can truly step right into the culture by visiting this historic site. It is massive so you can literally spend a good part of your day in there and still not see everything. Be aware that tickets sell out extremely fast so be sure to arrive very early to secure your entrance. Our tour guide told us that 80,000 people visit the Forbidden City daily! I highly recommend this tourist site for your Beijing travels!"
"Quiet a mystical place. Prepare to walk around 4-5 kms . Lots of galleries , exbhitions , shops for shopping. Coffee shops etc. Number of photo opportunities."
"The Forbidden City is a palace complex in central Beijing. If you love history, and/or remember and loved the movie ""The Last Emperor"" you shouldn't miss touring the Forbidden City."
"to keep walking east or west after the exit from the side gates. you CANNOT exit through the entrance near Tiananmen Square. Guards stop everyone attempting to do this and you have a 1+ mile walk back to east/west gates!!

Plan to spend 3+ hours here. and plan for lots of walking."
Came here on a Friday morning and yet there was a crowd. I cannot imagine how busy this place will be on a weekend or peak season. Recommended to reserve admission tickets online as they have a quota per day. English (+ other languages) audio guide is available for rental at a minimal cost. Scanners and body check is required before entering—smokers beware! your lighters will be confiscated. The place is huge so be prepared to walk a lot. There is a restaurant inside which you may wish to dine in as the tour took me about 4 hours. Recommended to visit since it’s one of the To-Go places in Beijing.
"Huge property. Lots of similar buildings. Impressive and historic, but crowded. You can bring a lunch. Prepare for lots of walking. Audio tours available (mine only worked for two stops.) Avoid on weekends."
"We visited during golden week 2018. It was not too bad, the place is huge so apart from some specific famous spots it was totally walkable and the crowds were not a problem.

However, please be aware that i dont think (i might be mistaken ofc) that during golden week you can purchase tickets on the spot, not even if youre a foreigner. When we went, we saw no ticket selling places, only a lot of signs saying “tickets sold out”. I believe that, having bought the tickets online and seeing how many there were left (0).
The problem is that you can only buy them online if you have an unionpay card or alipay (very rare if you do not live in china).
Your only other option is then to use a guided tour (i suppose the guide will purchase them for you). Indeed when we went we literally only saw other 10 foreigners and all were with a guide.
For first time travel/people who do not live in china/people who do not speak chinese... i do not recommend coming during golden week. Not because of the crowds but because there is a high possibility you will not be able to purchase tickets!

For every other time... i strongly recommend touring with a guide because the english audioguide is not that great."
"we came at a relative quiet Monday afternoon but typically many visitors from all over China and also all over the world visit the Forbidden City so be prepared for a ""mountain of people"" walking step by step in large queue's but it is definitely worth it: the beautifully restored palaces, the impressive gates, take a walk on the outer wall and look at the contrast with the classical corner towers and the modern Beijing skyline. See the workshops where also nowadays there are always skillfull workers preserving history. Feel the footsteps and palmprints from 14th-15th century emperors and staff all over the complex. Definitely a must see. It is all exposed to the hot sun so some hats and sunblockers are definitely a good idea to bring along."
"The Forbidden City is a massive complex built in the 15th century and served as the home of 24 emperors. Obviously, only royalty lived here and all the commoners lived in the the Hutongs which effectively surround the Forbidden City.

This is one of the few attractions where the number of people visiting on any given day is controlled. Tickets can be be pre-booked, saving time. We hired a guide through the hotel, tickets had been purchased, so when we arrived, our guide took us in through a special entrance, no wait.

We visited Beijing right after the Western New Year and actually the number of visitors is lower than usual, as the Chinese are working and most foreign visitors would not think of visiting Beijing in the early winter. In our experience, this is the best time as time most venues are running around 40% of the usual crowds. It's wonderful! Just bundle up and have a great time!

With a guide we were able to see key features, and of course, received a history lesson. We enjoyed visiting this massive complex, but can't lie and say we saw it all. It would be nice to return to see what we missed.

Recommended."
"Nothing can prepare you for the size, scale and popularity of The Forbidden City - 80,000 are permitted to visit each day. Suggest go early and expect some queuing.

Your summary: Over one million Chinese built this palace from 1406-1420 under Emperor Yongle. The first Emperor (of 24) to live here was Ming Emperor Zhudi. The last was Qing Emperor Puyi (who was forced to abdicate the throne).

There are five major gates, with interspaced courtyards and gardens. DO take an audio (or a human) guide to get the most from your visit. Every building, room, relic has a story and you’ll want to hear it.

Allow a minimum of 3-4 hours for your visit."
"We visited around 11am on a Thursday morning, the place was bustling with tourists/visitors, as expected. We did not use an audio guide but most structures have an English explanation. The scale of the palace complex and buildings is impressive but after visiting other sites earlier in the week, I have to say it all looks the same. We sifted through the complex with the crowds, viewing a few of the halls open to visitors (most weren’t accessible). We paid extra to see the Hall of Clocks which was pretty interesting, but other than that weren’t overly excited. We spent around 1.5hrs walking through, which was plenty to get an overall impression. Agree with other reviews that this is a must see in Beijing but not worth investing too much time."
"Such a huge complex and our group had only an hour to walk through.

Still great to see where the filmed The Last Emperor and on such a huge scale!
Bit of a line up to get in and the biggest crowds I saw anywhere in China but loved the while place."
"Amazing and very impressive, you could walk round it for days and not see everything there is to see. To appreciate it you really need a Tour Guide to take you round. Very crowded but still a must visit while in Beijing.

Note you have to through security to get in. Locals have to show their ID Cards, tourists their passports and you have to put any bags you are carrying through an X Ray machine."
"Went there very early at 9am, just 30 minutes after it opened and there were already lots tour groups there. There was also some refurbishment being done on some of the paving and the mini bridge. Even with all that, the buildings are still amazing. The square is stunning and grand. A must see in Beijing."
Large tour groups and throngs of people visit this historical site every day. It is helpful to have a good guide to steer you through the immense courtyards and to sidestep the lineups. The site is amazing and a highlight of any trip to Beijing.
A must see place. It took us 5 hours to fully explore but worth every second. Only negative is you have to walk the full length to get out. No side entrance just go the whole way.
It was such an interesting place. Highly recommend it. It is very busy with tourists and it's not always easy to get close to the doors or windows to look in to palace rooms.
"The buildings and site are very impressive but the contents are very samey for a Westerner. You can spend hours here but unless you are Chinese and really understand and are interested in the history, I would advise against spending too long here seeing the whole site. There are better things to do in Beijing."
"This place is massive. We walked the entire Forbidden City but missed a lot because of no knowing what we were seeing. I recommend the self-guided audio tour devices which we did not do. This would help. Go early as they only sell 80,000 tickets a day but it is still crowded. Still, a great visit."
"One word is enough to describe this monument! AMAZING! Huge, full of history and myths! It’s is nesseserry to spent few hours in, just to be able to see a part of it! We are really very lucky that this construction is still in a very good condition. As you probably have to remember is that it is made of covered painted wood! And thanks to their “ very good fire brigade system “ the forbidden city stands still there for us! Go for it!"
"steeped in history i thoroughly enjoyed this trip as i did a lot of historical research before going ,though it was during theur holiday so extremely bust not to be missed,"
"It's grand, it's massive and it's old, but there is little to see in terms of the inside of buildings. You walk around the site and each exterior looks the same and you cannot head into anything. We walked the perimeter and saw a random Grace Kelly exhibition at the site.

It was heaving with tourists and just rammed full of people trying to take the perfect photo. I really don't get what all the fuss is about. This is so overhyped as a tourist attraction. I'd spend half a day exploring the Lama and Confucian temples instead if they aren't on your list."
"I'm a half Beijinger, so spontaneous visits are possible. My favorite time to visit is afternoon in fall. Spacious, quiet are the necessary elements to feel the details and listen to the old stories. The animals sitting on the corner of the halls, gazing into the far distances. The hallways connecting the palaces are often forgotten.The rules every single details are placed take the time to dissect.... So the forbidden city is a delicate taste, instead of the fastfood visit. 速食文化的拜访，对于故宫来说是一种亵渎。所以，即便你只是一次造访，也请放慢你的脚步，认真地听一听三大殿的构造，主宫殿的风水。"
"This was my top place to visit in China. When we visited the Canadian consulate was visiting; therefore, there was an increase in security. Outside of the museum there were tourist shops and people offering to take your picture for a cost. Lots of military and police presence with cameras all around. Do not be alarmed; however, don't be stupid either."
The whole complex is huge and grand however i feel the grandeur and beauty of Forbidden City is dampened by the large amount of tourists (mainly local tourist). Also difficult to take photos without the loads of tourist. Maybe less tourists if you go early in the morning. Went there around 1pm.
"I was a little dissappointed in this, but that could be down to jet lag. I appreciate its importance and beauty but hated the vast number of people there."
You could spend an entire day here and still not see everything. A very beautiful historic place. I suggest going early to beat the crowds and staying the entire day. Make sure to bring lots of memory for your camera also.
"This is something you have to do in Beijing. The only problem is it not my thing, and it is huge! It is a full commitment of at least 3 hours to get from one side to another. It helps if you can find a good guide along the way, as they can make this more interesting, especially the stories on the Dragon Lady! It is amazing when you think how old everything else, and how well it was kept together, especially after Taiwan, and England took a whack at it. Worth a visit, but be prepared for big crowds, long walking, and fun stories!"
"I am so VERY grateful we did this in October when the crowds had thinned and the weather cooled. We walked for hours, took countless photos and enjoyed ourselves. We did carry water and fruit we brought with us."
"This historical palace covers a lot of acreage - be prepared for lots of walking. They have closed down many of the buildings for visiting. Glad our tour guide gave us lots of historical references - it must have been a very active place to live - would love to learn more about the ""crazy lady"" as the Chinese call the Empress."
"Very interesting many different sections. Get a map as you go in, or take a photo of the map at the entrance it really helps. We had a guide which really brilliant as he knew it so well and explained the history and each section."
"After traveling all around the world, Forbidden City - the Palace Museum is one of my favorite places to visit."
"I went to the Forbidden City on my recent trip to Beijing. It was one of the most crowded places I visited when I was in China and a place were there was considerable pushing and shoving to view parts of the attraction. This aspect detracted a bit, especially because I am a relatively small person and thus its hard to see much when pushed aside. That said, I thoroughly enjoyed my visit and many parts of this vast place are not as crowded as the top sites within the Forbidden City. The shear vastness of the place is hard to comprehend if you haven't seen it."
"Lisa, from Lily's Beijing Guided Tours, took us ina garden gate with her special paas that allowed us to miss most of the crowds on the way in.
We then saw a lot of Palace treasures that most tourists seemed to be missing and of course we also saw a took photos at all of the key points.
Lisa's information was great too and helped us get a better feel for what it must have been like in Imperial times.
Do this visit with a good guide so that you get the best from it ....."
"People covered what I would’ve said - very crowded, very very big, but I was interested because it’s so old and the detail was incredible. However most important thing I want to say is you CAN buy tickets there. I don’t really recommend it, but it’s completely possible. I wasn’t sure if we’d have time to do this or what day we would go, so I didn’t buy the tickets online, forgetting you “have to”. We got there and tried to scan the QR code they offer (for last minute lennys like myself) but the entire website is in Mandarin. Using another app I translated the information and had it ready, but you have to put a phone number to receive a confirmation SMS text to get the actual tickets. The main problem is that I have a Canadian phone number, so it kept saying there was a format error, since my phone number is only 11 digits. We found a Canadian tour group and he told us to go to the front (where they do the ticket checking) and after we showed them our passports, we paid cash and we were in with no problem.

They tell you to book online because there is a limit to how many people they allow in the park. But when we went (on a Tuesday afternoon) there was no way they had admitted 80,000 already, which is the max. Don’t stress if you don’t do it online. The ticket people were really friendly when I proved I was unable to book the ticket."
"Totally agree with the last reviewer; The Forbidden Palace is an overrated attraction that falls short of expectations. There is no interior view and the external buildings are all too similar.

If you want to view world class attractions in China head straight for The Great Wall and The Terracotta Warriors instead."
"I don’t understand why this is such a great attraction. You will shuffle in with thousands of people, shoulder to shoulder to walk around a bunch of buildings you are not allowed to enter. So you just see the outside of buildings that all look the same. Takes hours to get in and then from one end to another. Look at it from the outside by the street and move on. Not worth the time or effort! Go to the Temple of Heaven instead."
"After 3yrs of living in China and visiting attractions all over other parts of China...I finally made it to Beijing and the FC! Needless to say it was very impressive.

Our small tour group of (10) left the hotel at 6:30AM to beat the traffic and now glad we did. Even though we arrived early...there was already 1,000's of people waiting in line to see the tomb of Ch. Mao. We waited 3hrs for a 28-second glance at his body - under a glass fish bowl. Needless to say it was not worth the 3hrs, but we did not know it would take that long when we first got in line.

After Mao...we walked across Tiananmen Square, which is really really and then to the Forbidden City.....which goes from one-temple to the next....on and on...and you finally reach the end.

On a grand scale!!

Seen it - done it and time to move on!"
"Number one thing....book your tickets in advance through an agency. You can not just walk up to the ticket booth and buy tickets. There are several on line agencies that charge a small fee for booking....do it. Then you go to will call basically.

Get a guide???? Torn on this one. We did and we felt incredibly rushed. The place was packed with tourists and the guide just kept moving us quickly past big groups. We didn’t see even half of the grounds. Yes the place is huge, but allow yourself a few hours and take your time. If you get a guide ensure at the outset that you have made it clear How much you want to see, what pace you want to take it and how many hours you want to spend inside.... Negotiate the price. Would not recommend going with a tour group as it’s so crowded it’s hard to move around in a group or to hear the guide.

All that being said, it’s a cool place, but a lot of it all looks the same. It’s a piece of history and a must do, but know unless you go in the way off season, and maybe not even then, it’s going to be incredibly crowded."
"I never tire of visiting this amazing complex, which has its own appeal in every season. Please wander to the left or right, if not both of the central axis. Smaller gardens and unique pavilions with less crowds will be your reward."
Steeped in history. A must see on any trip to China. If you are not accompanied by a guide I recommend you have a good reference book on hand. Give yourself plenty of time to explorers book and cranny
"It seemed surreal to be standing in the Forbidden City and looking at the beautiful, colourful buildings with their interesting architecture...one of those life is good moments. It's definitely worth visiting this historical UNESCO site."
"In a nutshell the Forbidden City is a must see if you are in Beiijing. It is simply amazing how well preserved it is and it gave me chills to walk where the empowers once walked.

Be aware though that the crowds are thick. You will be amongst thousands of people. If you are walking the entire thing expect to put about 15000 steps on your pedometer so wear comfy shoes. Elderly or disabled can rent wheel chairs with a pusher for about $20 yuan.

Also be aware toilet facilities are not what we expect in Canada. Squat toilets, bad smells and no toilet paper, hand soap or towels. If you can deal with all that it is an amazing site to see!"
"This was the start, for us, in realising how old is Chinese culture.
Built 600 years ago and containing 9,999 rooms (according to our guide) the architecture and decoration is amazingly sophisticated.
This is a worth-while visit despite the ever present crowds (just a factor of visiting China).
With a knowledgeable guide, there is much of interest and some good photo opportunities."
This tourist location is a must see! It is hard to fathom that most of the country has nothing and a Chinese emperor can build a city like this for himself. A location to keep two wives and almost 1000 concubines. The actual size of this city within the actual city and 999 rooms is unbelievable! A for sure site to visit.
"This place is beautiful, wonderful, amazing...and words don't do it justice. We had a guide to take us through and who also pre-purchased tickets for us, so look into how to get in smoothy if you don't have a guide. Once you are in the history and the size of the place is truly wonderful. We were fascinated to see that 99% of the tourists were Chinese! And they were intrigued by us! We were stopped a couple of times with requests to have our photos taken. Wonderful people in an amazing place."
"Take your passport. No passport, no entry. Worth remembering for most sites in Beijing. Confusion at the start, very poorly signposted for foreigners. The Chinese all seemed to have purchased tickets in advance using QR codes at stations on way in. The ticket booth is to the right of the entrance.

I cannot pretend I was not disappointed. No doubt the vast nature of this sprawling site is impressive, but it would benefit hugely from some effort to make it come alive. The audio tour (40 yuan) was boringly monotone, but strangely lacking in any effort to enhance understanding and engage; proving to more describe what you could see for yourself. Also as I followed the Lonely Planet suggested walking route it seemed a lot of the sites were barred and closed. This meant I essentially had a nice walk down some well preserved corridors!

Huge numbers of visitors, I got there at opening time but the sheer number of people gave the feeling of cattle being herded from one end to the other. My advice would be to deviate from the ‘centre line’ and walk round the sides, meandering.

Worth seeing definitely, but could be so much better. In hindsight I’d have hired a guide or joined a group.

Also if you’re a single guy, beware over friendly ladies who want to go for a coffee or beer to practice their English. They hang around at the exits, I’d read about it in Lonely Planet and sure enough I was approached twice. The scam is to take you to a bar which then stings you with a ridiculously inflated bill. They sounded so plausible........"
"Bring ID, passport, be patient and respectful and give yourself a lot of time as there are big tour crowds.

For those new to China, be careful of the scams, check out Youtube to see as this was my only issue in Beijing, no English spoken on the street and foreigners are targets so educate yourself before going to CHINA."
"No more words for this place. Just make an appointment online and visit!
You will find fantastic things everywhere and enjoy whole day! but the problem is too many people and you need pass long security check line before you get in the palace."
I think it is a must see place. We spend there few hours with the guide of Demi which was very interesting.
"We took a private tour there. It is worth spending a whole day there. Beautiful place to visit. Loaded with history. As in most of China, bathroom facilities are basic. Always bring your own bathroom necessities with you"
"Take the subway toTiamenenem Square first. See the square, and then walk across the street to the F City. This is a magnificent area to see, but it requires a lot of walking."
Not too bad considering emperors stayed in here.I was unfortunate to be ard the area on Monday. Mondays the Palace is closed. So be there anytime except Mondays
"Omg the amount of people is unbelievable !! 😅😅😅
So many people every where each hour !!
Best tips is no tips !! 🙈🙈
9:30am to 3:30pm everyday so many people !! 😱😱😱"
"We entered visa the east gate. We avoided the queue around Tiananmen Square. From the east gate you can walk around the most to the main entrance. There are small vehicles that you can to drive you the short distance.

You need your passport to purchase a ticket. The passport then works as your ticket and is scanned on entry.

An audio guide is available. It’s around 40rmb. It activates when you enter sections of the city.

It’s extra to visit the treasure gallery. Purchase the tickets inside the city for 10b.

Few small places to buy drinks inside and various toilet locations.

Excellent place to visit. Only 60rmb."
A lovely way to see learn about the history of China. Get there reasonably early if you need to buy a ticket on the day as they do sell out later in the afternoon. Take passports too for ID and you tickets is registered to your passport number. Was ¥60 for entry and another ¥40 for an audio tour which was well worth it as it meant you could understand much more about what you were seeing.
"No one could leave Beijing without being there, the architecture is amazing, but each building/court is the same scheme repeated and repeated and repeated, most of the buildings are empty or the barriers are so distant that you could barely see what they contain, and there are so many people that you will spend most of the time trying not to step into someone else :) This said, the imperial garden is really amazing and the treasury rooms are realy worth the 10rmb additional ticket price. Strongly suggested to book the tickets online in advance, it will be sufficient to present the passport associated with the online ticket to enter. Remember to dress comfortable shoes and prepare for a long walk."
"This is a place must be visit for tourists.
The place is huge... inside have alots of handcrafted arts. Very nice..."
"Amazing history, culture, and architecture...you can spend several hours here getting lost in all the different sections. Unfortunately, it is overcrowded as with many touristic destinations in China. Still worth seeing though!"
Visited with my son. He did not like it as he could not appreciate it. I was awed by the structures. It was magnificent. So rich in culture and history. Amazing. Must visit when you go to Beijing.
"Incredible place. Language difficulties mean it is by far the most sensible option to take a guided tour but they do rush you through. I would much prefer to amble at my own pace, The sole traveller must be prepared to queue - I use the term loosely for an entrance ticket."
"We visited the Forbidden City last year, on a quick tour.

The place gives you a very authentic feeling of Chinese history and culture.

It is a large complex, and you need to spend a lot of time there.

It might be good to take a guided tour, to understand about all the intricacies of the Forbidden City."
"Super crowded and people most old lady pushing everyone. But the history is a most are at least once in the life time.
Direction were poorly but we figure it out some how. No one really helps tourists"
"This place is massive! Prepare to walk. Most people will enter from the southern entrance, which I recommend as the entry (Tiananmen) is very beautiful. Plus you can see Tiananmen square across the street.

After you walk through the first gate, realize the chinese word ""men"" on the end of many of their metro stops and Tiananmen means gate or door. After passing through this gate, then the large courtyard, then another gate, you are in the courtyard where you can buy tickets if you didn't purchase them ahead of time.

We had one gentleman outside the gates ask if we would like a tour we told him no. Then once we got closer to the ticket office another young lady asked us if we'd like a tour and we said yes. 300RMB for an hour and a half. We should have talked her down but I wasn't in the mood and she did a great job.

She bought the tickets for us on her phone APP and then off we went into the forbidden city. You can get audio guides as well, but we opted for a human.

The insides of the forbidden city are much like the outer courtyards, very similar architecture, but absolutely amazing to see. I highly recommend at least the audio guide as the history is very interesting.

The most beautiful area was the final area we went into...the concubines living area. It's the only place with vegitation, the rest of the city is very much hard surfaces.

When hiring a random guide, make sure they speak good english and negotiate on price AND time. Our guide was in a little bit of a hurry to get back to the beginning and find another set of tourists to guide."
"It has to be seen to be believed. Just to experience the sheer scale of the place is worth the time. If you enter the South Gate and exit at the top it is a 2km walk.

Unfortunately most buildings are closed up. I am not sure if it is possible to purchase a more intimate tour experience but there are a few opportunities to peek inside and get an inkling of what it may have been like inside.

It makes sense that they do not allow vast numbers of people into the buildings because the sheer numbers would cause damage to them.

The weather was beautiful so it was a perfect day to do it. I have been there in the heat of summer and do not recommend it.

There were large crowds of people but there was never any hold up.

Look out for a few petty ripoffs. Particularly the small trike taxis. They will charge an exorbitant fee and then throw a tantrum if you refuse to pay. It is best to avoid them or agree a price upfront. ‘Tour guides’ will show you around but many are just there to score commissions off you purchases at the local gift shops."
"I grow up in Beijing, and forbidden city was always in my mind. The red and yellow inside, I like it so much, and proud of it."
"I book the tour trough trip advisor, and I skip the queues! I recommend to get a taxi and ask to be drop in the west gate, then you walk to the south gate and skip the crowds.
It is unbelievable how magnificent and big is. I got the Audio guide, Totally worthed. I also purchased inside the extra ticket for the tresuare east wings. It is nice because you experience the city without the crowds! The opera is here and the Dragon Wall. Allow 3 hrs at least for the whole thing, I almost missed my train to Shanghai at 2:00pm because getting out of there in the north gate is an adventure..."
"It was very crowded around the entrance when we went but once you were inside it was ok. It is about 750m X 1000m. It was built in the early 1400's. None of the buildings are built with nails. All done with joinery. Each building had it's own use. Some were for sleeping, daily planning, certain ceremonies, or a building might be just used to change clothes in. A great place to take in the history of the Chinese Royalty."
"We were on a group tour- felt it was quite rushed, it is an amazing cultural experience and we would have enjoyed having a more relaxed walk through all the Gates- 9 to reach the forbidden palace. Our tour guide was very informative, but to experience it would have be so good to sit a while to appreciate the fantastic buildings and to experience what the Emperor had built and why?"
"I have seen films but the real life experience is far better. We had a guide from Chinadiscovery who was an expert on history. The size of the city was huge, buildings and courtyards were superb. It was hot and blue sky perfect for photo of which I took a lot.unfortuneatly you cannot enter inside buildings of which there are many. Perhaps there are some but we did not see them.We used about 3 hours walking from entrance to exit. We went early in morning as many thousands of visitors pass through every day except Mondays when museums in China are closed."
Went there on a guided tour. The place is huge with many palace of the Emperor. A lot of walking that we did not finish the whole tour. The place was also very crowded that you need to follow the tour guide so you will not get lost. But it is still a must see when you visit Beijing.
"Definitely a place to visit while in Beijing. It has many years of history and a guide is necessary to understand the significance.
However my opinion is that the Emperors were living in extravagance!
Old photos showed many areas around the palace are poor quarters and the Royalties just live their lives in ignorance!"
"The Forbidden City is of course a must-see in Beijing. The palace is huge, so you get some nice exercise just by walking through the grounds. Everything is well maintained and well run, but go early in the morning, because the crowds are big later in the day."
there is so much to see and you really need a local guide. (not a government guide) to tell you the real history and how it effects today china. Not as well maintain by the government. A lot of security in the area that restricts the locals from access.
Be prepared to walk a long way.Incredible place and another must see place in Beijing. Be prepared for lots of people.
A crowded place with many tourists. Can see the great place where ancient Emperors stayed and a place where they run their government or parliament. Big venue. Prepare to stay the whole afternoon to watch every single detailed rooms.
"Amazing part of beijing. My only regret is that I didn't do a guided tour, as we had to wait a long time in line to get tickets but people who do guided tours get to skip the line."
"Very expansive facility and fairly well maintained.

Can get quite crowded.

Lots of walking. Palace of the last emperor and about 10,000 rooms.

Impressive stone work as well as wooden structures.

Definitely a must see.

Quite a cultural experience."
"Absolutely awesome, just go and see it, can’t be adequately described in words. Spend as much time as you can and take a guide."
"A must see, but best to be viewed with an expert guide who can tell you what the significance of the individual buildings was. Our Guide, Nick, was able to point out who lived where, what all the different doors meant, who was allowed to use what and when and the meanings of the sculptures and decorations. Without that information we would have been lost in a vast landscape of ancient buildings and meaningless artefacts."
"To fully appreciate the palace you need a full days visit to explore beyond the main buildings. Having said that the usual 2 to 3 hours tour shows you the principal halls, the Emperors very modest living quarters and his private gardens. If possible climb Coal Hill, outside the rear of the palace, for a good view of the whole complex."
"Impressive and a tour guide needed, there are English audios to help and signs in English too. If I am critical it is the amount of other visitors where you shuffle more than walk. Plan for a couple of hours and bring your passport.

The Gardens at the rear amazing."
"Huge throngs of tourists tend to crush up in waves (as their tour guides address their groups en masse, detail the next site to be seen, and folks quickly scurry) to peer from the cordoned windows and doorways into the various Imperial chambers, banquet halls, throne rooms, and temples on exhibit. Fortunately the immense size of each of the numerous sprawling courtyards allows you to find “breathing space” once you can separate yourself again from the masses. Beautiful imperial gardens with mosaic tile pathways and temple/mausoleum follies await at the far end before leaving the compound. A guided tour can certainly get you through the highlights in about 2 hours. There is a general absence of interpretive placards in English, but helpful signage guiding you to the various exhibits and courtyards is present in Chinese and English. If you have less than 3 hours and are not possessing of “ninja-like” skills at snaking through crowds, you likely do not have enough time for a proper visit. The size is vast. There are security lines and ticketing lines and very limited ENGLISH communication. *Tip: You may reserve either an AM or PM entry time, but are not forced to leave until closing (so an AM visit means you may stay all day, and PM entrants may find it more crowded as many morning visitors may linger)."
"The forbidden city contained 1000 rooms and housed the Emperor's concubines and staff - no one else was allowed to enter.
It is essential to have a guide who can explain everything there is to see."
"This magnificent palace was the residence of Chinese emperors and is a must see attraction. There is so much to see and every time I visit, I see something new. You can take half a day to see the basic or take your time and explore the whole day. They have limited the amount of visitors to 80,000 a day so it is not as crowded as it used to be and there is no longer a fear of being pushed or elbowed. (There still is a lot of people but definitely more civil than many years ago so a lot more enjoyable).

There are additional entrance fees if you want to see the nine dragon wall or Imperial Treasures. If you have time, I would recommend seeing these."
"Always an amazing glimpse at Imperial China. Best done with a guide as it is quite an expansive complex, each with its own story to tell. I have been here more than once and still have new experiences. Take the time to soak in the history of this palace complex"
"We started by going into the park just to the north which has a brilliant view of the entire forbidden city from an overlooking hill.

The city itself is a bit samey. But on a huge scale. Super impressive. Not much to see inside the earlier buildings at least but just taking in the scale and majesty of the buildings from the open grounds inside is quite something."
"Buy your ticket in advance if possible and dont forget your passport. If you are buying your ticket at the site, bring cash. Wear comfy walking shoes and start early :-)."
"It was a great, great experience to stroll around where the emperors used to live. Got a great sense of Chinese history!"
"This place is magic!!! A lot of history, every step in this place is a repetición of so many steps in the past ... so many feelings... so many lives making history for us. It’s beautiful !!"
"The Forbidden City is not so forbidding if you go on your own (without the guides thank you very much). I highly recommend the side (east and west) buildings almost more than the main 4 structures because they are glimpses into the story of what life at court must have been in its heyday. Get the audio guide, which needs no attention whatsoever and starts the audio automatically when you arrive at a point of interest, with details and anecdotes of concubines and dignitaries and intrigue that make the plaza even come alive. Don’t miss the clocks or the jade carvings, both extraordinary. There is a beautiful quiet cafe on the west side near-ish to the entrance but off the main court for a break. Contrary to what I was told, you can in fact leave by the east gate, not only the South Gate, which makes it possible to do a loop without the endless walk to the south exit, making a nice circle of all the side buildings.

The shops are pricey but have top notch merchandise in pottery, wood, porcelain and silk, don’t miss them, right before the South Gate.

I bought my ticket on the premises at the entrance for 30RMB, I went on a Tuesday at about 11am, no line and then at the clocks and other galleries were an additional 5, very reasonable. My hotel tried to tell me to buy the ticket from them at 90RMB! Kind of a racket.

Without the pressure of being herded like cattle, it was a wonderful day, I spent about 5 hours altogether and had lunch there as well, which was very decent and surprisingly good cappuccino, they are catering to western taste when it comes to coffee."
Great experience being able to come to Forbidden City. Incredible how large the site actually is; it just goes on! I am sure we did not see everything; we were there right at opening (830 AM) - entrance fee 60 Yuan; and left around 1 PM maybe. We wandered through the site and checked out the various buildings. We payed extra to view the Treasure Gallery 10 Yuan. Lots of jewels and pieces of art on exhibit. We did not use a tour guide or a head set - I think I would use the head set the next time around to get more out of the site.
Stepping into the forbidden city is stepping in to the past. The Emperor's life can be understood when stepping through the forbidden city. The detail and ancient nature of all that is seen is mind boggling. It inspires one to think of life in a different way.
This area which was once the palace of the emperors is now a massive historical area and tourist attraction. It was very busy on this visit as we were here during a week of celebrations. Make sure that you set aside a couple of hours if you want to have a good look around. If you are coming to Beijing as a tourist this will be a highlight and is an absolutely must see location.
"Magnificent palace grounds and a huge garden right at the end. The entrance and exit is at different ends. And its a long walk. Be sure to wear sports shoes. Took about half a day to finish the whole area.

Crowded with lots of people and people bringing kids along. Expect lots of pushing from the crowd"
"I saw the movie the ""The Last Emperor"" but after seeing the Forbidden City, I want to see it again.It was much larger than I thought. Wear comfortable shoes and be prepared to do a lot of walking. We entered through Tiananmen Square and through the tunnel to the main entrance This awe-inspiring palace served as the seat of imperial power during the Ming and Qing dynasties.Our tour guide kept us to the sides and we didn't go in every building.It would take hours to see everything.The garden at the end was the highlight for me. It was a great place to relax and enjoy some shade. We didn't get to see the city from the higher vantage point...we ran out of time."
"Tried to visit Forbidden City and failed as name suggests :). Went through main gates but could not enter into inner courts b cause tickets sold out. They allow 80,000 visitors (tickets) every day ! Have to buy tickets in advance in order not to disappoint. The palace is HUGE. It will take a day to walk climb stop take photos of everything. So be prepared to spend time if you really want to enjoy this attraction in depth."
"First of all, my very best recommendation: watch the movie ""The Last Emperor"" before you visit the Forbidden City. I watched the movie afterwards but still made a huge impact. After seeing the movie you can wonder around The Forbidden City with a totally different knowledge of the place. Of course you can also read about it or take one of the audio guides they provide at the spot (they even have them in Esperanto language!). There is a lot to walk so bring an umbrella because there isn't much shade to hide from the sun in the hot season. I recommend to enter in the south gate and finish in the north so they you can go up the heal and to the temple to have a panoramic view of the Forbidden City.
Attention: it was impossible to get a taxi ride at a reasonable fare to get out of that area, the buses were so crowded people had to push to get in and there weren't many shared bikes around. So, if you don't have a private car, save a bit of your energy for another 20/30min walk to leave that area."
"We had a guide with us for Beijing and he took us to the Forbidden City. It is overwhelming in it's size. We were there in September and we had a lovely, clear day but there is no shade at all until you get to the garden at the end so it is hot. The guides believe you should see every throne in every building. You really can't see the thrones well because they are set back in a large room with no lighting. Take a glance but don't keep walking up the steps to see everyone. The exterior of the buildings and the roof lines are far more interesting. Allow time at the end for the garden. It is stunningly beautiful, heavily shaded and a great place to take a few moments to enjoy the shade and maybe a bit of quiet. We did not get to see the Hidden City from a higher vantage point as some have mentioned and I wish we had done that. Go through the City at a bit faster pace than the guide may set. The highlight is the detail of buildings, the garden and then the view from higher ground."
"This is probably one of the worlds most iconic places, with a fantastic history. You can get into the city from either end of it, but the most popular is from Tianamin Square, where you go through a tunnel under a 8 lane highway.
The main entrance is understandably very busy, with groups of people, both locals and tourists, bustling for the centre ground. Once inside, there is an open courtyard where you can buy food and drink as you enter the actual inner city.
Again the crowds focus on the centre ground, with lots of guides waving their flags on sticks, causing traffic jams. Our guide used his senses and took us on the periphery of the courtyards and only entering their middles when we wanted to see something, making it much easier to get through the city.
The city is about 1Km square, so it is pretty large. Most tourists appear to do it in a few hours, but they must miss out on a lot of interesting points, so we would recommend dedicating at least 4 hours, or even a whole day, to the city."
I’m not sure if it’s busy everyday but we went on a Saturday and it was too much. It’s hard to enjoy anything when you are forced to continue walking through. Also make sure you know where the exits are because we wandered around for too long trying to leave.
The forbidden City is an absolute must when visiting Beijing but be aware that the line through security is huge and I would suggest getting there as early as possible. Once you have passed through security you are then faced with the choice of turning left for the Forbidden city entry or right for Tiananmen Square. Visit the square first then you won't have to pass through security a second time when you go back to see the Forbidden city. Their is a lot to do and see in the square and really a full day is required to see the square and the city. The forbidden city is a maze of buildings and passageways but note - You can only exit on the opposite side of the city and it is about a 30 minute walk back to the front so plan your departure. This again is why I suggest you do the square first.
"This is one place where if you’ve seen the pictures, you’ve seen enough. The palace rooms are almost empty and you can’t even go into them. Skip the visit for CNY 60 and see the Palace from above at nearby Jingshan Park, just north of the Forbidden City. There, climb to the top and look down over the roofs of the Forbidden City and — if the air pollution is not too bad — a good portion of the rest of this city."
We went to the city on a day that the Chinese were having a holiday. Needless to say there were people everywhere pushing gnarly shoving. Even through it was worth the walk.
"It is marvelous architecture 600 years old made of wood. Well preserved.
Go early and be prepared for a lot of walking!"
"We enjoyed our visit to this place, however we didn’t really do our homework and ended up with a local guide outside. He was very pleasant and with the aid of our passports managed to get us in very
quickly - if I had done the homework I would have found it’s easy to book online and get audio tour. He was very pleasant and informative, his English name was ‘Tony’ however, he was a bit disappointed when he took us to the shop and did t want to buy anything. At the end of the tour he took the huff when we didn’t want to go to the ‘tea ceremony’, took our money and stormed off- not a good way to treat customers/tourists. So my advice would be, do your homework on how to get in (easy) get and audio tour (cheap) and avoid the guides outside. Caveat Emptor."
"if you are not one of the first people to arrive at the Forbidden city you will be in a sea of humanity...literally thousands of people go a day...we got in early and left when it became crowded, I would not have been able to enjoy it if we were walking around the thousands of folks that showed up...almost 17 million people go here a year now...wear comfortable shoes and expect a lot of walking."
"The palace museum has historical artifacts, textiles, and palace recreations from different historical periods. It was a fun, educational, and enjoyable way to spend a morning. There's quite a bit of walking, some uneven paths, and crowds, but well-worth it!"
"It was a very nice stroll & view but the tour usually last for about 2 hours or more if starting at Tianmen Square. If you are bringing elderly, make sure they are fit enough. Although you can rent a wheelchair somewhere, but it's a really long walk. Also, bring bottle of water with you & any kind of dangerous item/weapons are not allowed, you will be going thru security checks"
Such a huge complex and a must see. Our guide bought the tickets online so we just walked straight through. There were a huge number of people but it wasn’t a problem as it is pretty much a one way walk through the complex. In spite of the numbers it didn’t seem overcrowded.
"One must start early morning in order to avoid the long lines. As a foreigner, one should also bring one’s passport in case they ask for it. They usually do.

When we saw the long queue for the admission tickets, we got discouraged again to enter the Forbidden Palace, which was the home of the Chinese emperors from the Ming to Qing dynasties (1420 to 1912). This was our 2nd trip to Beijing and we were unable to visit this place for the same reason years ago
.

However, on our way back to our car, an English speaking Chinese spoke to us & offered us a tour of the Imperial Museum for a certain fee & avoid the long lines for the entrance tickets plus a short cut at the back with added tour. Definitely worth it. Perhaps, a guided tour with the Palace museum included will eliminate the hassle, if there’s no long wait involved."
"Very important historic place, it was very crowded and a lot of walking ,even though you can only view inside with furniture through the window but so worth it."
"12,000 pounds of gold leaf paper to restore this amazing palace. It’s hard to comprehend as a Westerner how old this beautiful palace is. A must do!"
"The place is full of people and very huge inside. You will learn how the olden days emperor and his place people live. You have to go through gate after gate before seeing where the king used to live. At the end of the palace, the place is also surrounded by river full of crocs. It's amazing place to visit."
Walking within the walls of the forbidden city was remarkable. So much history both good and sad I learnt so much. The buildings were not accessible and so I could not get a good understanding of the time however that did not disminish from a wonderful time
"My second visit and although I was just as impressed as I was the first time I saw it there were so may people the atmosphere was very different .The size of the complex needs time to contemplate in as much solitude as possible ,just to get the ""feel "" of it .Not to be missed, but if you are really lucky and hit a quieter day it is amazing"
"It would be ok if there were fewer people there. You don't really get to see much, probably more backs of people's heads as you get shuffled along not seeing anything substantial... I'd say save your hours and go somewhere more interesting."
"Known as one of the best and most visited landmarks in Beijing, China, Forbidden City was simply magnificent astounding in every inch of it. It’s a remarkable in its own way of how the ancient time of China was able to built such a grand place, or city, as you would.

Make sure you wear super comfortable shoes as you’d be walking around for quite long, 45-1 hour depending on your interest on each and every single crafting or carving or objects of it."
"We were taken through to the forbidden city after visiting Tiananmen Square. Not a lot to say except it’s spectacular. Our guide would not let us actually go up to the buildings just take photos but it was heaving never seen so many Chinese people in one place. We went in the little garden but then had a rest on the benches as it was way to hot, need to visit on a morning. Must see if your in China."
I had visited in August 2018. very hot over crowded. No online reservation facility for non Chinese. Entry from metro station very difficult and long walk. long and big courtyard. No covered walkway to protect from sun and rain. No drinking water arrangement. Food and cold drink costly
"The forbidden city is a palace complex in central Beijing, China. The former chins imperial palace from the Ming dynasty to the end of the Qing dynasty the years 1420 to 1912. Its now a museum. What I loved was that the city is surrounded by a 7 metre 26ft wall and a 6 metre 20ft deep moat. acting as a defense mechanism
The main colours of the city are yellow and red. The walls and pillars, doors, and windows were mostly painted red, which is regarded as a symbol of good hope and fortune, and happiness in Chinese culture."
I've been a few times now with different people visiting Beijing and the overall consensus is you've got to do it but it's not a revisit site. It is huge and repetitive. Unless the history means something to you it all washes together. Summer Palace is definitely preferable to me.
I had no idea how large it was going to be. It covered so many acres I have no idea how many. Lots of steps to go up and down. The buildings are so beautiful with all the intricate painted details. Best to get there early in the day because of the enormous crowds later.
"An amazing landmark of Chinese history. This is filled with artifacts, clothing, headdress, furniture, ceramics and carved jade pieces of Ming Dynasty Emperors. Plan on spending a couple of hours as this landmark is vast."
"I am not really a huge fan of these types of places(cities), but felt it ws very worthwhile going here to see it as well as lean some of the history that goes with it. I will say it is HUGE! I thought is was just one square - but no - I believe there are three sections. There are 9999 rooms in the place and the emperor would sleep in a different room each night. ( it would take 26 or 27 years to sleep in all the rooms). There are no trees for fear of an assassin hiding behind it. Also has 15 layers of bricks on the flooring to make sure no one dug their way up!
There are many ceremonial courtyards and you are able to see in a few rooms - although they are pretty spartan. Lots of details in many of the buildings."
"Pre book tour tickets (don’t just turn up) and get there early. We did and we’re glad as it was heaving by time we left. Fantastic architecture, sculptures and fascinating history of the Forbidden City. Definitely a must see."
Very rich in history and extremely well maintained like many of the tourist sites in Beijing. As well as the major halls don't miss a number of the small courtyards and the garden at the end of the tour is a major highlight.
This was very big place. You keep going through grand gates and not getting to the Forbidden City for a while. Everything is so grand and intricate in design. It is very impressive and I'm so glad we got to see it. Very crowded the day we were there.
"Local Panda Tour with Tony. Tony was a great tour guide being a history major made this young man an excellent guide for us. So funny as well as knowledgeable made the day so fun. Tony even took the time to take us to a great place to eat after the tour! I recommend to anyone traveling to China to add WeChat to your phone prior to traveling. This way, local panda or any tour company will give you the direct number to your guide and you will have one on one communication with them!"
I have been to the forbidden city for five times since 1988. I recently visited on 21 September 2018 and chased the tickets online. 80k visitors are allowed to visit each day except Monday which the city is closed. We spent over three hours in this city and almost 20k steps. Most of the buildings are not allowed to go in unless you pay extra to visit an jewellery exhibition. It is worthwhile to visit.
When I got there I didn't realise they are restricted to selling 80000 tickets a day and it gone by 8:10am......... If you go by yourself please make sure you book tickets on line or go early. Otherwise pay a little extra to go with local tour company. I been to the sign before and would be so happy to see inside again. But I still managed walk a big trunk of the outside palace and enjoying people watching.
It was an amazing place to visit can you imagine too how many people from all walks of life would visit that special place it's huge and well worth it but be careful & stick with your group as you don't want to get lost which i did!
It's way larger than we thought initially. Its a treasurer of history and architect. The construction evidences historic intrigues and schemes of rulers. Very interesting.Must visit.
Great place to visit great picture opportunities make sure to walk around the side streets as well as they are quite interesting there's a lotta touristy shopping available close by definitely worth spending some time in the palace area
"Our guide told us that more than 80,000 people a day visit the Forbidden City and it certainly felt that way when we were there on a beautiful Saturday in late May. We took the Metro (easily to use), then walked from the outside security point across from Tiananmen Square into the Meridian Gate. It is a long walk. There we located the english speaking guide and took a 2 hour tour. Much to see in 2 hours and we felt rushed, but satisfied. The Forbidden City is huge - we are walkers but it just kept going. We then exited through the Gate of Divine Might and walked back around to Tiananmen Square, before taking the Metro back to our hotel. It will take another trip to take it in everything there is to see at the Forbidden City."
"Definitely a sight to see when in Beijing. We visited this site as part of our Beijing 2 Day Tour. Our tour guide, Nancy was very informative and covered a lot of the important facts about the different parts of the Forbidden City. It was very interesting to say the least. Just be ready with lots of walking, as this place is humongous. Well worth the price of admission, especially if you love history! As for fees, we did not have to pay at the entrances as it was included in our total fees upfront. Highly recommend!"
"We visited the Forbidden City just for a few hours as we were only in Beijing for 36 hours total. It wasn't long enough (you really need close to the whole day to take it all in), but what we were able to see was jaw-dropping. Be sure to get tickets in advance because they limit the number of visitors per day and it sells out, especially at vacation times. Don't miss it. Then walk over to Tiananmen Square, which was also incredible. Be sure you have your passport or you won't be able to get into either location."
The size of the complex is breath taking. This a must see if you go to Beijing and an historian at heart. The art work is restored and the signs are in English too.
"A must do if you visit Beijing. Not a lot of different things to see but interesting to just be in the grounds and walking around. Go very early! The walk from the metro to the actual ticket gate is a long walk, maybe about an hour if you stop to look around on the way. There are only 80,000 tickets a day which sounds like a lot but there are A LOT of people. You’ll need your passport to buy a ticket but the ticket window doesn’t actually have a ‘tickets’ sign, it’s just the window to the right before the entrance gates/security. Domestic tourists will be using the pop up ticket counters paying by wechat. Automatic guide is just ok but was enough for us (we aren’t super interested in a lot of history). You exit at the far end so have a plan on how/where you will go afterwards from that exit."
"I highly recommend going with a guide, What makes your visit a Whole lot more interesting is the historical background behind the buildings; stories like: such-and-such room doesn't have a threshold like the others because so-and-so emperor ordered it cut so he could ride his bike in and out of the room.
Wear comfortable shoes as you will be walking a lot!"
"If you're going to be in Beijing, you have to go see the Forbidden City. However, maybe because I had really high expectations, I felt that it was more of a letdown. It was not as interesting as some of the other places to see. However, a good guide would make it interesting."
This was amazing in size and for the area that it covered. to think that 1 family (albeit extended) lived here and you could only enter by invitation of the emperor!
The most interesting thing about the FC is its visitors. Just sit anywhere and observe the variety of Chinese people who come from all over the country to admire the immense palace and reflect about China's past (and future) glories. The buildings themselves are not terribly interesting - and they've been redone from top to bottom. Do make sure you don't miss the four minor palaces on the W side hosting a fantastic selection of Chinese sculpture: that alone is worth the ticket.
This is very impressive with great craftsmanship and the size is hard to fathom. You need a medium level of fitness to get around the city.
The great place that i spend one whole day there with my friend..you will not get tried there..every thing is so gorgeous and huge that you will love to be there again.
"My wife and I traveled to Beijing for a tango marathon and decided to stay several days extra to see the sights. We visited The Forbidden City/Palace the day after Moon Festival. We arrived around 10am in the hope of beating some of the tour groups - they allow 80,000 visitors per day only (be prepared for large throngs of people)!! You can just turn up and buy the entry ticket to the palace (cost is 40 yuan) and if you want to see additional exhibits such as the Treasure Gallery, it will cost an extra 20 yuan. Bring your passport with you as the entry ticket is tied to your passport - they enter the passport details/number into the system and tell you to go to the entry where the guard checks on the system. The Palace is vast, and I mean vast! It may take you several hours to go through all the different palace buildings and exhibits. My favourite was the Gallery of Clocks which showcases some of the different clocks that were available in Beijing - if you like looking at intricate workmanship, then you'll love this place. There's plenty of souvenir shops in the Forbidden City so if you're wanting to buy something to remember your trip, then you won't be disappointed. Wear comfy shoes and clothing as there's a lot of walking involved. If you want to beat the crowds you can turn up really early (it's open from 830am). It's an extraordinary place with some interesting history, a must visit if you're stopping by in Beijing."
"While I admired the Chinese architecture, I didn't enjoy the crowd at Forbidden City. We paid extra to see the Hall of Clocks. The number of clocks exhibited from England, France and China was amazing. The creativity of the designs of these clocks made me realise how clever people have been. We wanted to see the 'clock show' at 11am, which involved 3 clocks on display being operated, but it was too crowded & we gave up."
"Wonderful but incredibly crowded, it would be a dream to see this with less people, but the forbidden city belongs to the Chinese People, and they have the right to be there over some tourist especially seeing that rhe majority of the crowds were Chinese. A solid tour guide is a plus!"
There is a LOT of walking but this is an absolutely incredible place to visit. In some areas the footing is extremely uneven so be very careful. Be prepared to cover several miles of stone walkways and stairs. A must see if you are ever in Beijing.
Definitely a must! Beautiful culture with intact colorful buildings. We had a guide which helped us get a real history behind the city.
"Amazing Place With Ancient Chinese Structures All Around The Place. Weekends Are Always Crowded. Place Is So Big That One Should Have At Least 3-5 Hours To Explore The Entire Place. There are Few Chinese Restaurants Inside Forbidden City.The Forbidden City Will Force You To Think, How Ancient Chinese King Would Have Lived Their Lavish Life. Very Well Preserved Chinese Culture In The Center Of The City."
Interesting visit with our tour group after the walk through the Square. I think there could be more information stands esp in English but at least our guide was knowledgeable.
Part of a tour excellent to see part of history it certainly has the wow factor security very strict which is good
"Everyone told me I have to visit this, but honestly once you get over the expanse of the city, the actual walk through each section becomes very repetitive, especially since you can't actually see inside most of the buildings. It was interesting none the less."
"This place is enormous. Just the shear space is what makes it great. There are no extras at the forbidden city, no flowers or plants just in order to show off the greatness of the buildings. It isn’t opulent but a very large number of buildings. As you leave the the gate by the wedding chamber there is a beautiful courtyard with trees and gardens, with a few shops. Again, a true example if the unique Chinese culture."
Robert our guide was very informative and showed bus all the relevant parts of this amazing site. The weather was fantastic so this made it even more amazing to see.
"I booked a tour which I regret it, is better to go on your own using public transportation which is super easy to navigate in China and very well signaled in English so you will not get lost and is not intimidating at all.
My tour guide not only wasn’t a good one but kept rushing us from place to place, this is pretty much the main reason I always preach that when you take a tour you are in “their” time not “yours” .
Main reason why is better to do it yourself, as per the history of the place goes just googled it or read the story in English at the complex.
My invaluable tip is:
1) Must and can’t stress enough when I say MUST BRING passport to go through the check point just like you would at airports, in China you go through these check points to access the subway systems and certain buildings including the Forbidden City, if you don’t have your passport with you then you won’t be able to enter.
2)MUST go early, the earliest the better, it open its doors at 9:00am if you are there by 8:30 am max you’ll use your time effectively as the lines grows longer and longer as the day progresses (remember TSA lines at airports, pre-check doesn’t work here -lol) and although is a huge complex is usually super crowded with this being said if going with somebody else make sure to
1) Keep an eye on each other, is easy to get separated and
2) Should you get separated from your party make sure to establish a point of contact and timeframe.

By doing so you’ll maximize your time there so go and enjoy on your own no tour guide necessary."
"Acres of buildings, gates, walkways and gardens form this domain for Chinese Emperor, Empress and concubines, soldiers and servants. Intricately painted soffits showed bright colors and designs. Over 100 acres."
"This former wooden palace Is extensive, and the restored parts are quite beautiful. You start at one end and walk to the other. Traffic flows in one direction.You need to stop along the way to look in the buildings with things to view inside via a window. You can only walk in gift shops...no other buildings. There are numerous buildings on either side of the main section to view as well. The large cauldrons throughout the complex were filled with water and used in case of fires many years ago when the palace was occupied.

You can purchase tickets at the Forbidden City or you can purchase them ahead of time online. They scan passports which act as your tickets to enter.

There are parts that have been restored, but we were surprised to see a National Treasure like this wasn't in better shape. Mind your walking because many of the pavers are not even or in disrepair. With the number of people going through, if they just raised the price of admission a little, they could do a much better job of restoring things."
The Palace is at once glorious and mysterious in that it seems every tile and block tells a story. The Forbidden City is a perfectly-preserved monument to China's imperial past and leaves one with a lasting impression ... and a desire to return.
"Amazing place, enormous imperial buildings with adjacent exhibition halls of various collections. Nice museum shops and kiosks.
Do not miss a temporary exhibition in ancient Greek art entitled ""The Antikythera Shipwreck"", housed in the North Gate, at the exit of the Forbiden city till December 2018"
A long walk around the Forbidden City with many interesting sights and information given about the Emperor and history of the dynasties.
"Most are aware of what this place is and it is a must-see location if going to Beijing. The following are some tips to hopefully make your trip more enjoyable:

Go early to avoid some of the crowd. It will be crowded no matter when you go, however its get more crowded as the day goes on.

The foreign ticket window is located on the right once inside the gate right before the security area. It is not marked. They do not issue a paper ticket and instead your passport is used as your ticket.

Most of the crowd and tours go straight up the middle. Instead consider working your way through the West or East part of the city and criss-crossing the middle. A lot easier to move around.

Take food and water/beverages in with you to eat. There are not a lot of options once inside."
"Wow this place is amazing. This is a must see spot. The history is awesome. With lots of huge buildings. There were lots of tourist that were there, very crowded. It is worth it. My boyfriend, my mom and I enjoyed it. Clean and well maintained.

We had a private tour “English” guide and it was absolute helpful to us. We don’t speak mandarin so the English guide made a huge difference in us understanding and appreciating the history of Forbidden City.

We really enjoyed, it is a top 3 things to do.
Beijing is beautiful."
"An amazing place to visit, there is a lot of walking involved, so if you have small children - take a pram!!! There are only a few areas with large steps!

Beautiful place to visit and well worth it - not the most exciting place though for young kids - unless they love to walk 😝"
Great tour in the Forbidden city . We had our own guide and that was excellent. It’s a very big area to visit and I recommend to have a guide so you have a chance to understand the history. Don’t miss this in Beijing!
You know you are in Beijing when you start to enter the gates of the Forbidden City. What really amazed me was the lack of greenery but also the amount of space the is held within the walls. You don't need to spend too long here but since it is juts across from Tiananmen Square and such a classical view of China you need to go just for the photo's.
So much culture and atmosphere. From the moment we entered the Forbidden City it was like walking back in time.So much to see we needed more time.Have put on our list for return visit.Our guide from Odyssey Tours was very helpful and shared a lot of History making it a memorable visit
"Even if you are on a guided tour, which I would recommend, you will get more value out of visiting the Forbidden City if you spend a few minutes reading about its history (even just Wikipedia!) before you arrive.

The complex is vast and the architecture fascinating. From our experience this is totally an outdoor tour with almost no internal axes provided. So apart from good footwear bring a hat, sunscreen and a water bottle if like us you visit in the warmer months."
"Forbidden City tour is an amazing tour which reveals a lot of History. It involves a lot of walking to cover a huge area. So, if the weather is hot, you are bound to Sweat a bit. It's a good idea to carry a bottle of water, wear comfortable casual clothing/footwear. (This is not a Shrine or a holy site by the way).

But the tour itself is worth it. It's enriched with past history and yes, you do need to take a guided tour of this (or at least, you'll need some knowledgeable local person to explain the past history etc.) The Palace Museum however, wasn't open to the public during our visit.

It's a huge site. This tour takes you through a few ancient compounds with Palaces, gateways, courtyards etc. all exhibiting contemporary ancient architectural designs of the past historical era. In one such complex you will come across some huge pots capable of holding gallons of water.

Yes, at least that's what everyone in our tour group thought so, until it was revealed that, the pots were initially designed to actually make human Soup, out of the prosecuted offenders during that era. But luckily, it's believed that no human soup actually ever eventuated! (On the Lighter side, I say -- Thank Buddha for that ha ha ha ha).

This is certainly a ""Must-do"" tour too if you visit Beijing.

Malay Adhikari
(Melbourne, 27 Sept 2018)"
"The Forbidden City is situated in central Beijing is a palace complex used by Chinese rulers from the Ming dynasty to the Qing dynasty. Emperors, their families and servants stayed there. The complex consists of 980 buildings. The palace exemplifies traditional Chinese architecture The Forbidden City was declared Word Heritage site and is listed as the largest collection of preserved ancient wooden structures in the world."
"First and foremost, it must be said that this is a must-see place if you are ever in Beijing as, to say the least, it is iconic! That being said, it was the least favorite spot during my vacation in Beijing. The gardens next to it were lovely, yet the place in general was not all that impressive, and here are some of the reasons why:
* I had to hire a personal tour guide because I did not have the WeChat pay option. However, I will add that the price for the guide, which included my admission ticket, was not expensive at all.
* there were WAY too many people there to enjoy the beauty of it all
The scenery of the city itself was quite thrilling, so it was worth it just for that. The square in front of the entrance to the city was not that impressive, so I would have made the decision to go up the mountain instead had I known this. Also, it needs to be well known and broadcasted globally that there are scam artists just outside of the city exit. Ladies will approach you, give multiple compliments, and manage to get you into a bar/ pub/ teahouse. I managed to walk with two ladies for about 15mins carrying on a conversation and even asked them why they singled me out. The ironic part about it is that I was thinking of having a cold beer due to all the walking around in the city, and one of the ladies made a mention of getting a beer. Just soon after, she was wanting me to cross the road, which I was confused at, yet I did it anyways. Then all of a sudden there was this place that had beer. This was the point were I started to question things. We went inside, and I got a beer, and they ordered tea. We kept on with out conversations, yet it was quite mind-alerting at points. Then the gentleman of the establishment came in to bring them watermelon seeds as well as two colas with straws in them, which I am pretty sure that they did not order. I was done with the beer and wanted to leave, and they made the mention that it was fast and that I should have two instead. The guy came in with the bill, which came to almost 800RMB just for those few things. I need to also mention that the guy came in to say we could sample some of their wine, and I looked at the menu, and there was really no sufficient descriptions and decided on the cheapest one, yet they insisted on the next tier. Thinking it was just for tasting, I agreed, yet it appeared on the bill. I was going to just pay for my wine and beer, yet one of the ladies said that we just split evenly, which is what I have been used to here in China, so I agreed. I gave the cash, and then that same lady asked ""well, since it is her birthday, would you want to go 50/50?"" I immediately yelled a resounding no and really just wanted to get out of there. The other lady made what appeared to be a WeChat payment to the guy, yet I am pretty confident it was just an act to look like she paid. The one lady kept asking me about special tickets to the opera place, which I kept replying with a no. We made it outside, and withing five minutes, one approaches me and claims to need to use the washroom and said to say our goodbyes here. I just threw my hand and said goodbye and walked away. They got me, yet not as bad as they wanted to, and I should have followed my instincts. So this made for the lowest part of my Beijing trip, and everyone needs to be aware of this if travelling here."
The Forbidden City is such an interesting place to visit - very large with so much to see - I don't think anyone would be disappointed.
"I felt it was a bit dull as all the buildings were closed to the public - there were no gardens - however our guide did give us some interesting information re the Emperor's, Eunuchs, concubines etc Very opulent life style."
"Huge site, best entered from Tiananmen but viewed afterwards from the hill to the North.

The buildings are all fairly similar, but there are some fascinating ancient artefacts, some over two thousand years old."
"The walls are painted in red and the gates look very much alike, of course, some bigger and more decorated than others but unlike temples and cities in other civilizations these are not made out of carved stones."
"Really big place. Subway was great to get there. Once there there are not many signs (if any) in English so we followed the crowds.

After entering you need to buy tickets - you need your passport for entrance/ticket. Head towards gate / entrance into the actual forbidden city (decent walk from subway to where this is) and the ticket bit is on your left- right up by the entrance. After you pay you use your passport as your ticket in.

We got the automatic guide in English - it is ok.

Massive place inside - lots to look at and be prepared for a lot of walking. Nice cafe in there for a coffee

Suggest going early in the morning. We did not look at the whole thing and were in there for 3hours. Have heard it is quite good with a tour guide who can give more insight into history etc than the automatic guide."
"Forbidden City-The Palace Museum is going back in time.nothing has been changed.there r marble bridges,long rows of rooms,huge courtyards, gardens carved walls and much more.but walking n comfortable clothes is the need of the day."
"The Forbidden City is an amazing site to explore, with so much to see and experience within the grounds. We were able to book tickets in advance using a third-party booking site, and would recommend that travellers (particularly those with no Chinese language skills) do just this for busy visiting times. We were there for China's school holiday season, and the place was packed to the brim. There is a limit of 80,000 tickets sold per day, with two entry times available and these were sold out on the day of our visit, and several days around the time. It is worth taking the time to plan and time your visit, and utilising third-party resources to make sure you get in when you want to! The small booking fee we paid was well worth it not to have to wait in long queues to purchase tickets! The museum and grounds themselves are amazing, and the additional exhibitions were wonderful. There is not much information for English-speaking/reading visitors so if you are not planning a guided tour, then it is well worth some pre-visit research to get some of the history and factual information before you go. All in all, it's another place in China that is a must-see."
It really shows the history of the country that goes back thousands of years. They have lots of security and lots of people but it is worth it.
"The forbidden city is usually included in the Tiananmen Square tours. This is a beautiful place full of Chinese History, amazing site and really is must visit if in Beijing. It is hard to describe except to say visit you wont be dissapointed."
Simple awesome. Huge property (understatement) with one building blending into the next however still breathtaking. Love the colours and architecture. Paid to go into the treasure museum which was very beautiful. Wasn’t too crowded which was great.
A fascinating glimpse into palace life at the Emperors summer home. The scale of this structure is amazing. Worth a visit. Unfortunately we went on a holiday when the number of visitors was even greater than usual
It was interesting to see the how they lived and where the concubines were housed. I imagined it would be better to be inside there rather than starving on the outside. Also the chances of seeing the emperor were fairly slim i imagine
"We didn't expect the sheer size of the place and for the walk to be so long, hot and tiring... Due to the fact that the whole area is paved the heat can become too much to bear for some visitors! All the buildings/gates look similar, so take in the details of the first one and turn back if you are not physically fit! After all it's a sad story anyway, if you think of the fact that the empress and around 3000 concubines were more or less imprisoned in this place and at the mercy of the emperors..."
"Great to see, crowds are overwhelming. Remember to enter at entrance Tiamen square and exit Diamen square (no exceptions). The parc and shops behind the hill are lovely too."
The architecture and the finesse with which the palaces were built was phenomenal. For US tourists - bring your own TP as the bathrooms are somewhat rustic.
"Really incredible place.

I had just a whistle stop visit while in Beijing on business but it was worth the effort.

Really needs a full day to do it justice or even 2. It was far bigger than I realised."
"Tremendous ancient palace. Don't go to Beijing and pass on the visit - no matter how long the lines ""appear"" - they move quickly!"
"I was really looking forward to visiting the Forbidden City. On our first attempt, we realised that you have to book online in advance. i had read a lot about it but had never seen anything telling you to book in advance. They only allow 80,000 visitors per day. we were approached by a so-called guide offering us VIP tickets at 800 yuan. Don't be tempted by this as it is a rip off. The actual price is 60 yuan each and our hotel booked it for us.
You are not able to enter most of the buildings and can only look in over a rope so I was really disappointed by that."
"We went into the Forbidden City after we had walked around Tiananmen Square, and it was an extreamly hot and humid, and there were thousands of people there. There are lots and lots of stairs, most without railings.
It was very beautiful and is in great condition considering it is over 600 years old..
Although interesting, I really wasn’t that interested in all the information about this place.
I can understand why we could not go into the rooms, but with so many trying to look into the rooms that were available for us to peek into, and being on the shorter side of tall, I ended up giving up trying to push my way in...

If you have any trouble in walking or climbing stairs, I would give this place a miss."
"This ""Forbidden City"" is not really worth paying to go in. (and dont waste your money on a guide either....

You cannot really go into anything and you just wait in long lines to see the outside of buildings and big courtyards. It is the same thing over and over again. You get a good feel at the front of the venue and can take some good photos there. At the back of the venue, there is a large garden but it was so packed, you just moved in a large crowd and could not enjoy.

Finding a didi from here is pointless... I suggest going with a hired car or walking about a km or so before getting a cab or didi.... they charge a TON if you try to hail a cab right outside. Plus many of the cab drivers will not pick you up if you are not Chinese."
"10,000 rooms! With 10,000 rooms you would think they would let you stick your head in at least one of them. Not!! The Forbidden City is a massive complex and it’s center piece is undoubtedly a grand palace. Unfortunately, you don’t get to see any of this up close and personal and the visit is simply reduced to walking around a mammoth space on cobblestone surfaces which are killing your feet. I don’t know what I expected but I can say I expected more than I received."
"Please do get me wrong - the Forbidden City is indeed a magnificent piece of architecture
But for someone with a passing interest in History and limited interest in viewing ancient artifacts this place can get pretty boring very fast. The complex is huge - so lots of walking. And if it's a local public holiday then God help you - just do not go. Please see photo attached. To me the best part was the view of the entire complex from the Jenshen Garden peak which is right outside the exit gate"
It’s beautiful and grand and very very busy! I was a little disappointed that you don’t get to go into the buildings. When we went there was a visiting dignitary and a lot of the buildings were roped off so we couldn’t get to the building doors. It was annoying having paid to get in and not being able to explore things closer up. Definitely worth doing but be prepared for the crowds.
"A trip to Beijing would not be complete without seeing the Forbidden City. There are thousands of tourists and locals alike coming to see this amazing Palace. Couple this with a visit to Tiananmen Square, as they can both be done in a day. The grandeur of this palace is mind blowing. A movie was made there The Last Emperor, one to keep an eye out for if you haven't seen it. From one end to the other is about three kilometers but easy walking. The palace garden has a tree, 600 years old. It is said if your kiss your lover that you will be together forever."
As part of a tour we visited this area and enjouyed a couple of hours exploring this historic site. Our tour guide gave us a very detailed timeline of the history of this area. Tip go early in the morning to avoid crowds.
"looks nice , but then when you walk though 7 of the same looking squares they start to get a bit stagnate, felt as if i wasted half a day here for not much in return"
"A Must-do, but get tickets ahead of time to be sure you get in and begin the day early. Lines move quickly—West Gate will often be shorter. Plan to Walk a path straight through after you are done to hike to the top of Jingshan Park for incredible views that really capture the span of Forbidden City’s scope. The best souvenir shop is on your way out of the park!"
"Our first stop was The Forbidden City and we walked around there for nearly 4 hours; hence over 12,000 steps on my Fitbit watch! It was an amazing place to visit and certainly not to be missed if you travel to Beijing. I suggest that you don't go in August when they have their national holidays as it is very hot and very crowded"
Ohh...that place is full of Chinese tourist and go there at morning time to get a ticket which was already sold out noon time. Entrance fee is RMB 60 for each and so many palce to visit inside and wear the slipper during the visit time which was feel for comfortable.
"I am glad we visited Forbidden City while we were in Beijing as it has a lot of historical significance. The buildings are impressive and expansive. However, note that when we were there, you could just look in main buildings, not go inside. It was very busy and was challenging to navigate with a wheelchair.

We bought tickets for the clock exhibit and for the treasure gallery and are glad we did. Both exhibits were amazing in different ways. The clock exhibit had lots of clocks from all over. It was fascinating to see all the intricate designs and the movement of the clocks. The treasure gallery had many different exhibits, many of them from the palace."
"We loved it, was with my group from Brazil there, spent some 2 hours and inspite of the crowd, everything went smooth and fantastic. We walked a lot, so much to see and learn!"
An amazing place to visit to get a sense of history. I would reccomend a guide for this particualr tourist attraction.
"No visit to Beijing would be complete without a visit to the fabled Forbidden City. A massive site, it consists of layer upon layer of spectacular palace buildings and open courtyards. Being one of the world's premier tourist spots in the world's most populous country, it's no surprise that a visit to the Forbidden City involves mixing with thousands of people. Tour groups are everywhere,
My 3rd visit to the site but first in summer. Still enjoyed the visit and saw many different things. We had a private guide who quickly manoeuvred us through the site ensuring we went to as many of the exhibits as possible. Spent 4 hours but could have spent more time in the treasury."
"This place is huge! We walked through it visiting all that we could but to properly see the venue you need a day. Having said that we spent two hours as part of a tour group and are certainly glad we had the opportunity. Our guide told us many stories about the building, the customs and the people who lived here prior to the 1911 revolution. It is certainly a must see in Beijing but as usual, be aware of the ""squat"" toilets."
"A definite must see when in Beijing. We had hired a tour guide (Toursbyjessie.com) as we had a limited amount of time we were able to spend in Beijing. Jessie had pre-booked our tickets as it is required to provide your passport and book tickets in advance online. While we were in the Forbidden City, Jessie was able to provide us with so much history and information about the architecture, how the people lived, and many traditions and customs. The Forbidden City was definitely a highlight of our time in Beijing."
The ancient emperors palace is extensive and historically important. Many spaces with significant meanings and history in abundance. Extremely well presented but please be sure to take a guided tour to get the full understanding of this iconic site
"Stood in line for an hour after getting preferential tickets by our guide. Unable to see into any of the chambers, Too far away to take photos. Rooms covered floor to ceiling by protective transparent partitions plus the barricaides keep the many tourists at least a metre away. The history and culture are truly incredible, but waiting for a National Geographic program expose would be far more more revealing and informative. The Summer Palace a much better option but go in the afternoon for less crowded."
"This place just goes on and on you go through 1,door thinking you are finished and another court yard is there again.we were there on a very hot day so remember to take water and a hat.
The foot paths are not always straight so good shoes are a must."
"The Palace is awe inspiring, history at your feet, just entering their is awesome.It's a must see when visiting Beijing."
It has so nice and historical buildings of the china emperor...it has also museum has emperor's wife contents...a nice place to enjoy ur day in
"Located opposite the infamous Tian’anmen Square is the Forbidden City. This is an incredibly famous site even among Chinese people. Each day up to 80k visitors are permitted entry. Pre-purchase tickets to avoid unnecessary queuing. Bring a passport.

Once inside the grounds you are pretty much herded like cattle through the middle section of the site. Nip off to the sides to experience a less crowded experience though either way the experience is pretty similar. There is very little to see here and there is very little in the way of curation. There is however an abundance of gift shops and small restaurants built into the city. I had never been to such an overcrowded site of such significance before.

I would recommend going to the southern end of the site. Behind the forbidden city is a beautiful park that gives an amazing unspoiled view of the city.

If you want an alternative The Summer Palace is much more impressive and enjoyable (though it is 40 mins by Subway)."
"A trip to Beijing would not be complete if you haven't been to the Forbidden City. The history and preservation of the gates, palaces and temples is great.

There are heaps of tourist at the site so be prepared for the crowd also weather-wise make sure you bring water, umbrella, sun protection, caps as weather could be too hot or too cold.

Wear appropriate footwear too so that you're comfortable transversing the forbbiden City.

Highly recommended site to visit."
"There is a LOT of history in these buildings. If you have a knowledgeable guide, it's that much more interesting."
Very busy but worth the visit. The size and magnitude of this grand place is amazing. Where comfortable shoes and take your time as there is a lot to see.
"A must see in Beijing, lots of people and lots of walking but definitely worth seeing. It was still very hot in September, so bring plenty of water."
"I really loved the Forbidden City, but it was too crowded. Make sure to bring water, they only sell it at the entrance.
It's beautiful and you need at least 2 hours to see everything.
I recommend"
"Top of everyone's must do. Did not disappoint exceeded our expectations. This is a very busy place we visited in September on week day not to overcrowded we had time to see everything at our own place. The size & history of this place is huge. Our hotel booked the tickets (which were our passports) must take them. We took the subway to Qiamen station and walked through Tinamen sqaure to get to the Forbidden City which I would reccomend. We spent 3/4 hours here but we could have spent longer, it is an a amazing place. Also reccomend after passed through the North gate (exit) walk up Jinsing park, this is the view you always see on TV overlooking The Forbidden City you truly get the epic size from up here amazing."
"it's a Huge complex. You spend the best part of the day here if you had time. You need to get there early before it is too crowded & to ensure you get in. We have our own tour guide and Tour Manager who English explanations will help you make the most from it as well reading up on it in advance.Was quite busy but still great place to visit, the history is amazing and a must see to go with all the other places in Beijing"
"Another must-see site in China. More than beautiful and very large. Absolutely worth every moment spent. On a sunny day, wear a hat and sun lotion, as there is not much or a shade.
I was expecting something much smaller, but this is a real city within the city of Beijing. Excellently preserved and maintained. Avoid Chines holidays as this may be overcrowded. Even during normal days there is enormous number of visitors.
Senior citizens and children pay 50% of the regular price"
"Huge complex. You could spend the best part of the day here if you had time.

You need to get there early before it is too crowded and to ensure you get in. You will need a passport to enter.

Not English explanations so a guide or book will help you make the most from it as well reading up on it in advance."
"Was quite busy but still great place to visit, the history is amazing and a must see to go with all the other places in Beijing"
"Great historical city in the centre of modern Beijing. Strongly suggest having a guide to explain the buildings and their residents. Very interesting, if not somewhat shocking, history of the emperors"
Spent half day here. Not that crowded as the schools have started . September good time to visit . Even with the help of a guide too much to takin about the chinese emperors and culture !
"Don’t let the humongous crowd be a turnoff. Expect massive crowd at entry points and certain exhibitions/palaces but the “city” is big with many palaces to see so there’s room to breathe :)

Plenty to see even though some are closed to public. The artistic exhibition to simulate how it was in the old days was really nice. Another thing that amazed me was the Chinese characters also went through evolution (I didn’t know!). The weapons were also quite peculiar

It was quite a last minute plan so it wasn’t well prepared. I went there on Sept 1st

I bought the ticket 3 days before my visit. At that time, the visitor count on the website was already 71k so I strongly recommend buy online. Ask your Chinese friends or the hotel to buy for you

Take the palace map with you as you may get lost with many palaces look the similar. As the crowd moves in one direction, I recommend to complete one area before moving to the next

There are many benches for resting. Pack snacks and water

End your trip by going up to Jingshan Park for the vast full view of the city

If you take the train from Beijing South station, take the subway to Tian’anmen East station line 1. Take a right from the exit then pass the first security check with your passport. Then follow the crowd through the Tian’anmen gate; the big red building with the portrait. At the ticket counter show your passport and you’ll be granted entry (thanks to space M for sharing his/her bad experience). Then pass through another security check before entering the palace

I think I’d come back again with a guide"
This is an amazing spot that takes several hours to view the architecture and artifacts. Well worth the visit when linked to Tiananmen Square.
Our tour guide was very friendly and knowledgeable. We received a lot of historical information that made this visit come alive. Everything about the tour was delivered as promised. We highly recommend this tour to everyone.
I have visited the Forbidden City and The Palace Museum four times. It is very interesting and quite large so it was good to visit it again and take more time in the areas where I had gotten tired on previous trip. Sometimes it is quite crowded but there were times when it was much less crowded and easier to enjoy and take pictures. The biggest part is the historical building and also the lay out and approach the royal areas.
This area is huge with plenty of walking to do. Make sure you have good walking shoes. Lots of people. Very much worth seeing.
"Take your time,so many things to see that you may spend a whole day there exploring. The ticket costs 60 Y (Sept '18) + 40 Y audio guide (optional), your passport is needed for buying the ticket. Don't be confused by the plan that shows the ticket office in the courtyard, no office there and the Visitor Center doesn't sell tickets either, you will find the ticket shop at the entrance right side ""in the wall"" with no signs, but there are some girls in uniform and they will show you. If you don't buy ticket online, go there for the opening on weekdays, there is a chance - visitors are limited to 80.000 persons per day."
"Very much enjoyed my visit to the Forbidden City and would gladly see it again. We spent over 4 hours sightseeing and still did not see it all.
I would recommend that you take a whole day for this area to research and explore.
There where lots of places to purchase drinks, snacks along the way.
I highly recommended getting the auto guide tour, made the experience more educational and enjoyable."
"very nice place if you are interested on chinese history and botany, since You can find many many different types of trees and flowers."
"This is a beautiful place with lots of history. We saw it with a tour guide which is the best way to understand what you are seeing. Bring your walking shoes, it’s close to 4 miles of walking, I think.

Don’t miss this when visiting Beijing."
"The Forbidden City is a must see in Beijing, it's absolutely stunning! Prepare for A LOT of people and queueing to take photos/ look inside the buildings."
"This place is big and there are many people. I went on a Sunday, which might have been part of the problem, as more locals might go then, but I'm only guessing.

I went with the Lonely Planet guide and bought the audio tour. I still had difficulty figuring out a path through the place and figuring out what I was seeing.

When you arrive, don't join the massive line labeled ""ticket check"" until you've bought your ticket. The window to do this is on the wall on the right. This is not labeled clearly. Be sure to bring your passport. They use that as your ticket number.

Some of the exhibits mentioned in Lonely Planet and on the audio tour were not opened and there was no signage.

Not my favorite thing.

After a while it all begins to look the same.

It wasn't really my favorite thing."
"Very very crowded with local and foreign tourists. Best to go with a tour guide so that they can explain and introduce the different palaces. Very interesting place, full of history"
The museum is part of the forbidden city complex of 980 buildings completed in 1420. The complex was also the seat of power for that 500 years. Quite the sight walking through the complex. A lot of the good stuff also made its way to the taipei museum
"The Forbidden City is of course a must when you're in Beijing but if you're travelling in peak season, be aware of the 80,000 daily ticket limit (this sounds like plenty but there are a LOT of Chinese national tourists who visit during their summer holiday).

We arrived at 10am after going through very long queues to get through security before entering the grounds itself only to discover that all the tickets had been sold out that day. If you're not travelling with a guide, this is frustrating since we couldn't see anywhere that told you (not in Chinese, at least) that the tickets were sold out before you actually get onto the premises.

When we enquired at the help desk, they advised that you buy the tickets online however the website is only in Chinese. We worked around this by asking our hotel receptionist to help and he was able to book the tickets on our behalf (he paid on his credit card and we paid him cash). We booked for a couple of days later, and you can go to either the left or right ticket check points, show them your confirmation and you're good to go! (Note: there isn't anywhere to 'pick up' tickets, you just go to where they have their next level security and they check your booking there).

From what I understood when speaking to the help desk, they do have some tickets available in the morning but you'd have to get there ahead of opening I imagine to ensure you get a ticket.

Also, they do not operate a one-in-one-out ticket system so once all 80,000 tickets are sold, that's it for the day."
We spent several hours exploring this opulent cultural icon along with many thousands of others. Our private guide gave us enough information not to overwhelm. Again it is one of those things 'not to be missed' in Beijing.
"Even showing up before it opened on a Tuesday, the place was still filled with people. It took us 30 minutes just to walk through the security line. Think Disneyland. Every picture has tons of people in it.

The audio guide starts automatically based on where you are within the city, which is cool. I really enjoyed the treasure room and hall of clocks, and the garden near the north gate was lovely.

I hate to tell anyone to skip it, but everyone I traveled with liked the summer palace a lot more and I don't feel like visiting the forbidden city was a particularly memorable or fascinating experience."
"Located across the street from Tiananmen Square, Forbidden City is quite a complex so plan to spend a minimum of a few hours there because there's so much to see. Unfortunately, we visited on a very cold and windy day so standing on stone for a lengthy period and being out in the elements made for a miserable day. On the day we visited, the Chinese government was holding their annual meeting in Tiananmen Square so security was high and the Red Army was marching all around the square, which was neat to witness."
"This is worth a visit the history is amazing.
I went a Sunday and it was full.
Remember ID as passport
The hearing equipment in English was really worth it.
Remember good walking shoes it is a long long walk.
You can purchase refreshments once you are inside."
"Aside from walking in a city within a city, there isn't a lot more to this.

If you have the historic context that appeals, then you may gain more from it. But it isn't greatly scenic of itself, it's very crowded due to its history, but it superficially is fairly plain especially since the interiors are mostly bare, with some bells and limited furnishings. There is limited signage. For the most part though, you're just walking through buildings and courtyards, though there is a rock garden, a water way and some other features.

I suspect for most, they will remember it as a key site they visited, but not for a lot more than that.

Note for international tourists: You require ID to enter here, so will need your passports to get in!"
"Foreigners do not have to book tickets in advance. It is actually almost impossible to do so unless you go through a tour guide. We turned up and bought them (about 10/11am). You do need your passport though! Also, it is closed on Mondays!
We spent 4 hours here or so. It was very interesting, and we bought the audio guide. One worked fine, but the other didn’t, and I was unable to get them to change it (their lack of English, and my lack of Chinese!). If I were to return, I’d read about the history of the place before. Having watched a documentary or two now, more makes sense. It is vast palace, and you could spend the day there."
The museum is really big and do expect lots of walking. Would recommend that you read up about the history of the palace first so that you can appreciate the museum better.
"the sheer size of the crowd ruins the feeling this majestic palace has to offer. yes its a major tourist site ,and theres no way you cannot allow masses to go there. but seeing so many people in one site was too overwhelming . none of the buildings are allowed to be entered so its not a museum as such. more walk around courtyards admire the buildings and the swarm of the crowd. if your expecting to be blown away with the palace. you will be disappointed. crowds crowds crowds ( be prepared even on the road before you enter the outer compund will take a good 30 minutes in the heat , being pushed and queque jumped."
"Certainly an unmissable site in Beijing, the Forbidden City is a valuable site to visit. Go upstairs to the second floor after you enter for a great, uncrowded view of the whole complex. It's almost unimaginably huge, although very few interior furnishings remain. The greatest surprise was that it is really as much of a military fort as anything else, designed to protect the emperor at all costs."
"I have only one word to describe this place, and that's magnificent. You cannot imagine how huge this place is until you've been there yourself. And to walk through the halls where the kings and Cixi empress dowager have been, it's surreal.

Early September is hot. Crowded but not that crowded to me. This place is humongous anyway. Many places to take an instg worthy photo.

Foreigners can purchase paper tickets at the foreigner booth. Do bring your passports for verification."
"One comes to Beijing to see the Great Wall and the Forbidden City. There is no question of whether or not to visit the FC. Summer time is very busy and crowded. On the days that we visited in late August, the tickets are sold out. If you are Chinese citizen, and you have means to pay via mobile phone, you can make advanced reservations. We can't. Luckily, since we hired tour guide for Mutianyu Great Wall, our guide helped us buy the tickets. Anyways, make sure you get tickets ahead of time if you are coming in peak season.

The place is huge. Agree with previous review, I do also feel the Moor Palace (Alhambra) is more intricate and beautiful, but this is grand in scale. The place is extremely crowded, and unfortunately, most of the halls cannot be entered, just able to take a look.

I would recommend visiting Jingshan (Coal Hill) Park after finishing Forbidden Palace. That is right across the street from the exit of FC. There it offers a panoramic view of the Forbidden City. One can appreciate the scale of the FC from atop the Jingshan Park."
"Absolutely amazing! I had read about The Empress Cixi before venturing into The Forbidden City and it was just as impressive seeing it in real life. The Temples and Corridors are stunning, the colours so vivid and gold everywhere! Just go and allow a morning or afternoon to soak up the atmosphere. Follow up with a climb to the top of Jian Shang Park as you get a wonderful overview of the Forbidden City."
"When the sky is clear at the sunset time the architecture looks good. After you finish visiting it, you can go to the Jing Shan park(just north of forbidden city) and look it from the high hill."
"Beautiful, marvellous, astonishing!!!
How did they build that place? It is breath taking. Huge. But you pay for going into each part of the palace. If in July or August, wear something light. It is hot as hell and millions of people everywhere!!! Packed crowded!!! You go in, see it all from the outside but to see the specific rooms/places, you have to pay to enter each one of them."
"Of course, it is a place you must to see in your life. Huge, wide palace, grands courts. Pity, the pavillions are empty and we can look only the walls and roofs - even that, impresionable. The palace is crowdly, in August - very hot. But it is clear it is a obligatory point of travel."
"Be prepared to fight massive crowds. The buildings and grounds are so spectacular, however, it is definitely worth it."
Great place full of history where you can see the demonstration of power of the ancient emperors. Recomend to take water and snacks because if you want to see it all you’ll need at least 3h. It’s also better to take an umbrella or hat because of the heat and go soon because of the queus.
"The Forbidden City is rich with history. Everything is vast and there are thousands of rooms. The day was extremely hot though and I was unfortunately ill. There are lots of shady spots, but it is usually jam packed. My only complaint is that they didn’t sell umbrellas or parasols which would have been amazing helpful. Luckily someone else on the tour leant me hers. I would definitely recommend this to anyone traveling to China. It is a must see."
"This historic landmark where ancient Chinese dynasties live & govern in grandeur and excessive opulence is an eye opener. The architecture and layout have strong feng shui influences & bodes auspiciousness for its occupants.

The sprawling city behind walled confines was a world of its own. There are more than 5 adjoining gates & halls. Gain entry from Tiananmen Gate then start the Forbidden City walk starts from the Meridian Gate, through other gates until exiting at the imperial garden.

The crowd was pretty thick despite the sunny weather. Be prepared to walk more than one kilometer under hot sweltering sun without any shade. There are pit stops along the way - seats, gift shops, drink stalls and museum.

Be blown away by the sheer opulence and decadent lifestyles of the powers that be. Not to be missed. A trip to Beijing is incomplete without a sojourn here."
We walked through from Tiananmen Square and through the gate and courtyard was huge with palace buildings all around. Absolutely beautiful. The whole thing is one way and we didn’t stray from the centre due to time constraints but all he main palace buildings are all in the centre one after the other. There are descriptions about each main building in mandarin and English so we didn’t feel an audio tour was necessary but they are available. Was got us was the size of this place and all the colours. Really is a gorgeous place. The downside is the crowds. It was hard to get a look in some palaces because of the amount of people with cameras and selfie sticks in the way. It’s a lot of walking as well so make sure you have comfy shoes. But happy to have seen the ancient palace.
The place is massive and makes you wonder what the emperor's life was like. From the entrance to the end it would take you up to 6 hours to tour all places. I would surely go back to complete the places I did not visit.
"Because of being in a tour group, we basically bypassed most of the lines/queues which were formed to get into the area. Our guide was excellent and was able to tell us much of the history of the area and details about various parts of it that would have been missed without being in a tour group. Weather was fantastic in August, we only had 1 day of mild rain during our whole 8 days in China."
"To see this place will take up the entire day. We arrived here at 10am and finished seeing it at 5pm. So much walking and climbing stairs. Every time we thought we were done, there was more to see!!! This place is just ongoing for miles and miles. Its also one of the most crowded places I have ever visited. But the history, architecture, and importance this place holds meant more than a few pushes and pulls."
"It will be crowded, but it will be unforgettable! 3 hours you will see everything (rushing a bit), so take more time if you can to see it in a more relaxed way (of course in a middle of a crowd). It will be worth it"
"The place is huge and takes quite a few hours to take in. But what you really need to understand the history is a guide to give you the fascinating and long history. Our guide was amazing, his knowledge was outstanding we thoroughly enjoyed our tour.
Note it was a private guide so just two of us which always provides a much better tour.
Make sure that you have good walking shoes, water and a hat. We were lucky and did not have huge crowds to deal with"
"It is a must go place for foreigner who wish to know Chinese emperors history.

You can spend a day inside.
Many visitors so be patience when you are at entrance."
"To go back in history of China ,you have to see the Forbiddencity. It was as usually very crowded but still we had lots of time to see all the historical things .Try in your Hotel to get tickets for the Forbiddencity, so you do not have to stand in line."
Forbidden city is historical land mark of China that must be visited if you visit Beijing. What I read about it and being there first hand is amazing. Just imagining that commoner were not allowed. As for as it's architecture beauty it's not what I imagined because Mughals and Moores Architecture is much grandeur that this. At the same time it's still worth seeing.
"Other than the crowds, we had a fantastic visit. Apparently 80,000 people visit each day! We got a guide from the official tourist center at the entrance - we thought that was much better and cheaper than going with a guided group tour."
"If you want to understand the power and spledor of the Ancient China, you must visit the various palaces. The Empress area, the private garden are really magnificent places. And of course the first yard where Pasolini made is famous movie is unforgettable and belong to the common story of humanity."
"Visited the Forbidden city today with friends. The architecture is beautiful. There is a lot of history associated with the place.
A must see if in Beijing."
Be sure to give this site plenty of time because it covers an enormous area. We spent the whole day here and still didn’t get to see all of it. Audio guide does not cover enough of the site.
"This was good, massive place! History is very interesting and the gardens at the northern exit are stunning! Just before you enter the garden there is a virtual room that you have to do! It cost 40cny and you sit in a moving chair with virtual mask and it explains in English an overview of the forbidden city with an insight to what it all looks like back in the day. Stall and read the signs, very interesting history. Maybe get an electronic guide also, we realised on exit that this was available and would have liked it. We traveled alone with a private driver for the day because we had heaps to do in one day , so no tour guide. Still worth the trip"
"Definitely go, but try not to do it on a weekend (especially in the summer). We went on an August Saturday and it was absolutely packed. Make sure you can get a ticket! If you don't, you can probably buy one off of someone lurking around selling them at a premium. It's still not super expensive, and made things much easier. Give yourself plenty of time (at least two hours) since there is so much to see."
"You cannot miss the Forbidden City and the Museums inside, though the day I visited some were closed, perhaps due to renovation or reform, which nobody really could explain. I read online that only 80,000 tickets are printed every day, and at least in August when I visited the place, they were sold out by 10 am. Get your tickets online, or with a travel agency. Getting inside the Forbidden City is difficult especially because distances are huge. It's quite a walk just to arrive to the gates, and there are two security check ups you have to pass before. Carry your passport with you, as no visitor without an official ID will be allowed to enter. Large crowds of people pile up at the security check ups, and if you travel in summer, I would advice to carry with you a bottle of water and a hat or an umbrella to protect yourself from the sun. If possible arrive by subway and not by taxi, as the subway will take you closer to the first security check up, whereas the taxi might not be allowed to enter the avenues near the entrance and drop you off further away. The travel agency buses too are allowed to drop you off a bit closer to the entrance. But the subway in Beijing is air-conditioned so, though there are some very crowded stations, it's a good and cheap way to go from one place to the other."
It was a very hot day when we went here but it was well worth the visit. There are 9999 rooms here although they are mostly closed as they are empty. But it is great just to see the size of everything It is a huge place to walk around.
"I always heard it is a mustsee place, indeed, worth to see. Anyway compering other places I was a little bit disappointed but probably I expected something spectacular."
"Didn’t end up booking tickets in advance so woke up at 6:30 and got there by 8:15. The area to buy tickets is past the first entrance and right before the ticket check to the right (I took a picture).

Honestly, I wasn’t impressed. It might have been nice without the other thousands of obnoxious Chinese tourists, but alas, that won’t happen. A lot of rooms are locked up so don’t expect to see everything.

We were here less than 2 hours before we just had enough. Unfortunately it too is another hour to find the EXIT!! There’s only 1 at the very back. If you want to exit at the front you have to pay to walk through the park.

Unless you really like looking at rooms an emperor used to have some alone time with his concubines for 3 hours, skip this."
It was very hot and crowded at this time of year but still so impressive. Edward filled us in on the history. Amazing culture.
"Make sure you plan ahead for this site.

If you plan on turning up and buying tickets at the gate, get here before 8am otherwise it will be sold out. They only allow 80,000 visitors in each day. That sounds like a hell of a lot but I’ve never seen so many people in one place than here.

I recommend that you book your tickets online or via your hotel. We booked via our hotel for 60 ¥ each. As UK travellers they book via your passport so you don’t get a ticket but just need to bring your passport which they scan at the Meridian Gate.

We turned up at around 10am on a Tuesday. The queues to get in were crazy, at least 2 hours waiting time. Probably busier on weekends and Tuesdays because it’s closed every Monday.

We decided to take a walk and come back later as we knew we had our tickets. We walked to Jingshan Park just north of the Forbidden City which had amazing views of all of Beijing. Definitely visit this too whilst here.

We came back to the Forbidden City around 1:30pm and there was no queue to get it and we walked right through.

We got an audio guide which was very useful and it took about 90 minutes to casually walk through. It would be difficult to see everything in one visit here but well worth the trip."
"We were in China during the wrong month. Public holidays and the heat got to us. Heavy on crowds and there is nothing big to see. The museum is a better bet.

Book online as you will not get tickets at the ticket counter."
"One cannot go to Beijing without seeing the Forbidden City, but August is not the best time to go, due to the heat, humidity, and crowds carrying shade umbrellas that make it difficult to get close enough to the inside areas to get photos."
"The Forbidden City or Palace Museum is a must see in Beijing. Following advice on the Tripadvisor Forum we booked tickets the day before and arrived early - 08:30, the place was still extremely busy, especially around the main gate (glad we had already booked). The FC is a large historical site, there are very few rooms you can actually enter, but the size and scale of the place is impressive. I can only imagine the number of people increases during the day."
"You could admire ancient Chinese architecture and inspire the building capabilities.
It ll be an automatic guided tour. Have same water, a pair of sun glasses and a fruit like orange with you. Little tiring.
There are few ships that sell ice cream, water halfway, and food outlets."
"I felt the grandeur and aura of the past just being there itself. It is both majestic and mystical. You can take 5 hours to soak in the atmosphere. I took a short 2.5 hours where I managed to walking through all the main halls and side chambers and still able to pause for photographs and shop for souvenirs.
Souvenir shop inside the Forbidden City, is definitely a good place to visit buy souvenirs and not expensive at all! There is vast variety of things other than key chains and fridge magnets.
You can buy tickets at the palace itself for RMB60 only but you need to bring your passport if you are not a citizen. You won't miss the ticketing area as it is situated right in front of the entrance."
"After reading numerous reviews saying that you could stroll up mid morning and get tickets, this is what we did. However, we learned all the tickets had long since sold out!

Now, it was Chinese holiday season so there were a large number of domestic tourists, which may account for this. However, from what I gather, they have recently started limiting tickets to 80k per day.

So, either book in advance on the website (you may need some help with this if you don’t read Chinese- we got our hotel to do it) or get there before it opens!

Once inside, it’s excellent!"
"Forbidden city certainly lives up to expectations. Its vastness, beauty in detail and craftsmanship, the traditional Chinese influence is breathtaking. The Forbidden City challenges the world to think about China in a different way; China as a country with great creativity, vision, engineering power. Would definitely visit again."
"The forbidden city is of course a must see, but I must be honest it was a little bit of a let down. Maybe I expected too much. It’s large with many buildings, I think I expected something more opulent.
I’m glad I went"
If you like walking this historical place is one of best places to travel. Make sure to carry water and of course take a lot of pictures
"You cannot see the inside of the palace. In the summer temperatures rise to 35 Celsius and it’s very hard to enjoy the site. Also, once you see the first building, the others are the same."
"The forbidden city is a very big and impressive palace the history is outstanding. But I recommend getting a guided preferably online with a good rating because it is nearly impossible to get in with out one. Me and a couple of friends try to see the palace on our own but it was impossible, we check online and got a guide for the next day and that when I saw that it was a great choice we brought a private tour guide just me 2 friends and the guide they got the tickets and we walk buy almost every line we did not have to wait to get in the guide just shows there ID and that it we were thru ahead of everybody and having the guide explain the history as we walked thru the area was a plus. The only thing is that the place is huge but there are very little areas or rooms that we can actually get in other wise very impressive."
"We went there early in the morning accompanied by many Chinese tourists which made the queuing more interesting.You can purchase your ticket from the ticket office using a credit card, many of the buildings can only be viewed by glancing through the doorways but overall you get the feeling of the historical significance of this city."
"This site is absolutely huge, beautiful setting and buildings. We had a guide which saves a lot of wandering round aimlessly and provides a useful insight into the significance of the site and buildings themselves"
"There was little or no opportunity to view the inside of any of the palaces. We had to resort to viewing golden thrones from about 15 metres away (through panes of glass). Take your walking shoes as it’s one way in and the exit appears to be on the other side of the buildings at least half a mile away if one were to take the most direct route.

Located adjacent to Tiananmen Square so good option to round off a local visit, but I was underwhelmed."
"Lots and lots and lots of people but just amazing...a must visit. be there at 8.00 AM to avoid the incredibly long queues, buy your tickets on line, also go see the Jewellery and jade exhibition...costs a bit more but out of this world."
"It is a very beautiful enormous place. Obviously, it is a must.

However, in the first place, it was so crowded it took us a while to go through the security point and it was difficult to find the ticket office.

Secondly, due to the ""rules"" you can't go in with beverages or food and you must leave your items at the entrance. So, when you want to leave the place for the park behind the forbidden city to see it from the top, you realise you have two options to get your things back, both a hassle: 1) going back to the entrance, recovering your staff and back again for the views or 2) going through the exit, seeing the views and surrounding the city to go through the security control again and in the city to recover your items. It's like a trap, a maze and all because they want you to buy their overpriced drinks, meals and souvenirs.

All these really put me down and made us waste our time."
"Seems like the crowd has gotten worst and worst year by year and seems the Palace museum has more and more section closed off to public. But nevertheless, it is still an awe inspiring place. Just wish there was some way to reduce the crowds. There is now an online ticket purchase system and all tickets have to be purchased in advance but is doesn’t make any difference, there is still a huge line up to get in. Do not forget to bring the ID you used for the ticket purchase. No matching ID will mean you are rejected at the door."
"When in China there are a couple things you have to do, seeing the Forbidden City is one of them. Please note: They are not open on Mondays and you need to go early if you want to be let in, preferably when they open. They only have a certain allotment of tickets per day. We went when it opened and whilst it was still busy, we were able to buy our tickets and get in within 5-10 minutes. The City itself is quite big and you can spend some time in there. My personal favourite part was the Garden, but everything was beautiful. A definite non-miss."
"Forbidden city is a deninite place to visit due to its history . August is a very busy time and hot and humid and once you enter there is no way to come back as way out is on the other end . Be prepared to walk atleast of 1.5 hr looks like 3 hrs . There is no shaded area to take a break as the crowd are massive . For older persons be careful as the walk is not easy and stairways are everywhere with uneven pathways . Definitely avoid holiday season to visit this attraction .
Overall it is a great experience to go there once only ."
visited on a rainy day in the school holiday season. Incredibly crowded. It was a mere tick in the box- nothing worthwhile in the arduous 2 hour long trip inside the palace except knowing some history about the place. If you are looking for something scenic or peaceful just give it a miss
"Breath taking experience to witness this long and huge palace in the heart of Beijing. Inspire of 80,000 people visiting each day the crowd keep flowing like flow of a river"
"Were there in August , 2018 with Panda Tours and unfortunately was rushed through and was very tiring having gone there after a long flight . It was a little like looking through all the churches in Europe . Suggest you look at it from the square , take some photos and walk on to something else ."
"We were there on a busy saturday and almost missed the chance to get inside. Book your tickets well in advance, as you might not find them on the spot! The site is massive, so keep at least half a day for it."
"Obviously this is a must see place and luckily I read somewhere that you need to show your passport to buy the entrance tickets. The palace is really big and there are countless people. It was more pleasant to go through treasure gallery and concubine garden.

When you go through the Forbidden city don’t forget to go up to Jingshan Park on the hill which gives a great view of the Forbidden City. Dont forget to reverse the order though as you would need to go around all the way."
"Nice cultural experience and a must see if you are in Beijing. However, there are a lot of people and very crowded. Recommend to buy tickets a few days in advance!"
"You pretty much have to see this place if you're in Beijing, but the question is how. I left my hotel at 8:00 am, getting into the Forbidden City by about 9:30 (after time spent traveling via subway and then getting through security). By then all tickets for the day had been sold. So I tried again another day, leaving at 7:00 this time. The line for the security check was shorter, and by about 8:10 I had my ticket and was in. I had planned to spend the whole day here, but in three hours I had seen everything I wanted to, and it wasn't even lunchtime yet. If it were less crowded perhaps I'd recommend staying longer, but I think half a day is enough for most people."
"it is hard not to get a feeling that the majority of (non-Chinese) visitors just seem to suffer the unbearable crowds and (in summer) the heat to tick another item from their list, and jawn looking at the seeming repetition of buildings and views. Partly they are right - they can hardly see anything apart from the facades and roofs of the buildings, and the ornamented stairways. Of course, if you know at least some of the history linked to this place, you may find yourself in an opposite situation - by adding dimensions and colours to the images of greatness of the place you brought in your imagination. There are many details to enjoy during the visit. You may even enjoy observing the people in the crowd. But what I missed is some demonstration of real, fleshy history - helping all the visitors to get a better insight and understanding, and to even enjoy in the process (not only suffer and wait to escape...). Maybe it is too early to expect quick changes - but the knowledge about making a visit to a museum educating and fun is not so far away - like in the city museum below the TV tower in Hongkong!"
"This is a must see place if you are visiting Beijing.
The tickets need to be booked in Advance.Our hotel staff helped us to book tickets online,one day in advance.There is a limit to number of visitors.
The whole place takes about 4-5 hours.
It is a beautiful place ,truly royal. The halls are big and have beautiful coloured roofs and well preserved. The clock and jewellery museums are beautiful.They have a wonderful collection of things belonging to the Royal family.
The imperial garden is also very beautiful.
Too vast a place. There is east and west wings.One can choose what all to see.Tourist guides can be of help.We took the audio tour which was good as well. The forbidden city has a rich history and one can imagine how the royal family lived.
There are water kiosk and small stores selling fast food.
The back gate opens out in another beautiful garden.
Overall we were very impressed with the place."
"We knew we wanted to see the Great Wall, and added on the Forbidden City as an anticipated second day. It was fantastic! Such an amazing place, almost 1000 buildings in beautiful condition. Some you can go in to, some you walk around, or you can go on the walls around the city. On a hot day, the buildings with air conditioning are a welcome break."
"This is a must see stop. We walked 8 miles that day and did not see it all. We have been to Europe but this is massive. We bought the ticket to see the clock displays, they were not to be missed. I have never seen such amazing clock work in my life. It is worth the time and effort to spend the day here."
"First things first, you need tickets to get in and they sell fast, it is very crowded. Second, it is a CITY, so you've got a decent walk ahead of you, wear something comfortable. Last but not least, don't underestimate the weather. We went in July and it was really hot (we live in Texas, we know hot)! Make sure to bring sunblock and refreshments; they have some concession stands up front with drinks and snacks but inside we saw only two and they were pretty far from each other. I would not recommend this activity for families with small kids, it is super crowded and involves a lot of walking (non of the little ones we saw were happy). Once inside, you are mostly looking at the buildings and although architecture is gorgeous, it get's tedious. I read a lot about the Palace before going in but still, I would recommend to get a guide. We had a great guide who shared some totally random and fascinating stories about the Palace and things inside it, which made the walk more interesting and easier to bare. There are various tours you can find on TripAdvisor or even at your hotel, they are relatively inexpensive and most of them include tickets so you wouldn't have to worry about that. I truly enjoyed our visit to the Imperial Palace and think it is well worth it and a must do!"
"Like many must-see AAAAA attractions, this one is not as amazing as it looks on photos. There's not really much to see besides buildings and empty open spaces.
I'd argue that the best way of visiting this place is from the Jingshan park opposite the main exit. The climb is not this hard and you can see the entire Forbidden City from it."
"Queues and crowds, some more queues and crowds, oh, and queues and crowds!!
Great to do but just be warned! Tickets sell out so try and get online first at least a day or 2 in advance"
Well laid out and informative. We learned a lot and recommend this as part of your trip. well worth it.
Went through the city with our guide explained the history. We really enjoyed the garden and the display of pottery.
"Needed to have a commentary as we walked around. Lots of history. No information given. Huge crowds . Not recommended in summer.
Adjacent Museum in Tiananmen Square definitely worth a visit."
Stood with my mouth open for most of the visit. Felt unbelievable to be actually here. You must go and see this city and all of the sights here.
"Locals recommendation is to buy tickets one day before of early morning the day of your visit, as the site only allows 18,000 people daily, make sure you have your passport as it will work as your ticket. August is a very hot month to visit so make sure you have plenty of water, you'll be able to buy drinks inside as it has booths and cafeterias located all around the site. Wear comfortable walking shoes, the place is crowded thru the middle so try to visit all the buildings on both sides of the site, there's plenty of art to admire so give yourself plenty of time."
"Entrance is amazing. It's big, it's massive. Just as you dreamt it! At this moment you realize you will experience something unforgetful. You appreciate the art and surroundings. You enter into first square. The view is amazing. You are amazed by the space and majesty of the place. Despite the heat and crowd you are joyful. You move through next door to explore more. Another square, very alike to the previous one. You move through next door – another square, name of the square changed but looks not that much, maybe the added or removed statue here and there. Repeat it by 15-20 times. At the end your guide still tries to teach you something but you don't care. You made a lot of walking that day, they don't call it a city for nothing. There was heat and plenty of steps – you are just happy to go back to your air-conditioned bus.

It's must-see but if you are tight on time drop going inside or just walk through few early squares, others are very much alike. Slightly overrated.

TIP: You must have passport with you!"
"I highly recommend a guide. You can do it alone, but there are so many little things that you will miss. I did mine with Iris and she told me so many things I would have missed. It's amazing! Lots of people selling books and postcards on the back side entrance. Remember to barter!
PS if it is raining GO! I would have loved to see the water coming out of all the Gargoyles."
"you can read up on the history etc elsewhere.What really impressed me was the size.There were thousands of people there, and still a tremendous sense of space.A few pinch points at entrances but we were through them in minutes.Nothing much to see in most of the buildings.Some otherseg Watch and Clock museum needed additional payment,from a different point,though nearby,to the attraction.I was part of a larger ,unguided ,group.If I were to visit again i would get an audio guide and explore the side buildings"
"You walk through a gate and see an incredible, beautiful courtyard that could hold 10s of thousands of people. You are in awe. Then you walk through another gate and see it again. And another. And you think, this is it, I've made. But no, there is another gate ahead. And another. It is just so amazing to think about the people and events that lived between those walls.

And I will also say this about China. They don't rip you off. You need a drink at the Forbidden City after walking miles in 100F sun? Buy 3. Because they aren't going to charge you $10 for a drink. You want to buy an umbrella and fans (we did) at the Palace Museum store, go ahead. You have a great gift at a reasonable price that carries a weight of memories with it.

I really enjoyed China and it's treasures, and this is one of them you shouldn't miss.

We did go with Catherine Lu Tours, which I heartily recommend. A private guide who is knowledgeable and can get you in and out of the best sites in and around the city, so smoothly."
"I went with a friend early/mid August. Very very hot, which I think spoiled the experience a little. Was given a headset first of all to explain the different sites. I'd say don't get this unless you're on your own and can commit to listening, or you're with people who are very dedicated to learning the history. It's impossible to listen, navigate, take pictures and have conversation all at the same time, and the headset is 40 yuan and they won't necessarily know you want it in English even if you ask. My friend had to reiterate in Mandarin I wanted an English one because they gave me a Chinese one in the first instance when I asked in English. The Forbidden City is super stunning and interesting, and though I didn't get to see inside any of the buildings except peer over many heads to see a throne in one of them, I would definitely recommend a visit. It was worth going to, even if just to casually walk around, and the gardens are beautiful. Some areas are restricted only to people with special tickets, which cost more, but you can get a general feel for everything without going everywhere. It's huge, but if you're more going for a casual visit, a couple of hours is enough. Definitely take a good camera!"
"The forbidden city is massive and definitely a historical landmark you should include on visit in Beijing.

purchase your ticket ahead of time. Tickets were sold out the first day I had planned to go.

Be sure to take your passport if you’re a foreigner. It’s required if they decide to check you. It was also how they verified my ticket purchase, by entering my passport number into their system.

If you take the subway, it will drop you off closest to the entrance. I was told a taxi cannot get as close and has to drop you off farther away as they are not allowed inside the Square.

The forbidden city is impressive but so very crowded. The government limits tickets sales to 80,000 per day. Combine the number of people with the heat and it can make the experience less desirable. I witnessed two women yelling at each other with some shoving.

You can purchase an automatic self guided audio tour and walk at your own pace. I chose just to walk the grounds on my own.

There are many shaded areas and places to get drinks to cool off.

I found a shop with a very cold portable air conditioner and stood in front of it while drinking a bottle of water I purchased there. It was refreshing.

The tour begins at the front entrance and lets you out the back. There was no subway station that I could locate at the back. Just many tour buses picking up people.

I ended up taking a bicycle tour through Hutong and the bicycle rider dropped me off near a subway station."
Another must see area when in Beijing. The lines were long and slow moving on our July 20th visit. The buildings and grounds are just so amazing.
"A very important part of the Chinese culture, rich traditions and meaning. Get ready to squeeze into a massive crowd and be prepared for long walks."
"Worth the price of admission (free) to see it once. Bring your passport with you, you may be asked by security to show it to them at the entrance. Also, be prepared to have your bag x-rayed and you have to go through a metal detector. If you are like me and like to travel with a small leatherman or swiss army knife, you are better off leaving it at home. I was fortunate to able to return home with my leatherman after so many metal detectors and bag scans (at tourist attractions, subways, train stations, and airports). Also, be prepared for a lot of body contact during the summer months and national holidays - there are domestic tourists everywhere."
"This is supposed to be a must-see place to visit when traveling to Beijing. It is a huge place (it's called Forbidden ""City"" after all) with very similar buildings that you cannot go inside. The visit has more historical value than an aesthetic one in that the structures aren't necessarily the most impressive ones.

Definitely avoid weekends or summer as the crowd and heat will get to you. Overall, there are more impressive places to visit in Beijing like the Great Wall."
"It was good to have learned a bit about the forbidden city before going. Many details The buildings are fascinating. The ""concubine presence"" is better understood if we get some information ahead. So, read a bit before going
There is a Post Office in the Forbidden city, close to the concubines Palace. It was the single opportunity to send real postcards so I used it and everyone who got them loved. So, take addresses with you if you like sending post cards. The people at the post office will even stamp your cards with a typical Chinese stamp that you cab choose from a dragon to a serpent etc..
Also, at the end, we get to the imperial gardens. Beautiful, but depending on the walk it is easy not to care anymore. We were told that in the garden there were ""Reflexology Pathway"" for the emperor . So, find them (they are paths with small stones all the way) and TAKE YOUR SHOES OFF and walk on the path the emperor used to walk, barefoot, to get a foot massage. It is easy to recognize the places were the path is for ""foot massage""."
Went to forbidden city or properly know as the palace museum I thoroughly enjoyed myself even though it was a bit crowded. Tour guide Linda from Lilly touring company gave great background and history lesson and pointed out many small details I would have missed. Shops were expensive but also willing to negotiate a bit. Genuine articles for sale not fake jade or pearls. The only negative thing was that I was trying to take picture of a replica dragon throne but they wouldn’t let me because they want you to dress up and pose for a picture for 100 yuan.
"Maybe it was the intense heat beating down on us but the Forbidden City goes on and on, and it seems like we were seeing the same things over and over again. The architecture is amazing to see but after awhile of seeing the same structures I was ready to head out. One of the most interesting things to see is the amazing moat that dominates the outer portion of the City on the north side. You have to visit it while in Beijing but I saw better things than this like the Summer Palace, the Temple of Heaven and Tiananmen Square itself."
"The place is huge and beautiful. You must like walking a lot, but I think that's worthy. I visited following a tour guide because this visit was included in a day tour, and it was really convenient because we could skip the lines and he told us lots of stories about the life inside this complex of palaces. We also had the spaces almost empty because we went there early (about 8), so could take great pictures."
Absolutely recommend a visit to here! There is so much to see and visit. There too many buildings to count and many preserved with traditional painting etc. You need a long time to visit as the outer areas are vast before the inner sanctum.
This is a must see- fascinating to see how the Emperor lived and worked together with his family and concubines. A very large place to visit- so be prepared to walk quite a bit. Large open spaces surrounded by fascinating buildings.
Yet another must do and can be combined with Tiananmen Square. The whole set up and architecture is awe inspiring. Take your time and soak up the history of China. A great way to spend a few hours
"Open layout, can be very hot outdoors in the summer. The architecture is similar to summer palace with the imperial colors. You cannot enter inti the buildings though"
"Well I was amazed by the pure size and scale of this place. The security measures are mind blowing and the scale of the place is like nothing I've seen. Highly recommend you join the other 80,000 tourist that go in on a busy day to see this place..."
"Whatever you do, never go on a weekend. It's almost always crowded on any given date and time, that's for sure, but avoid weekends. This is what we did, and there's just wayyy too many people, especially mainland Chinese. The place is massive, but I wish they have more stuff around explaining its history. I suggest hiring a guide. Get your sunscreen on and a change of clothes, it's gonna get really uncomfortable. There's also a lot of walking, which I liked, but I suggest doing some stretching before and really making sure you're prepared for it.

Go to Jingshan Park right after to see the Forbidden City in all its grandeur from the top! (if you can...but there's just too much smog)."
"A mind blowing experience - just so much history. Make sure you hire an English speaking guide, they add so much information, our girl Eve was just fantastic and put up with my questions!!"
"Very impressive! Free admission and amazing scenery. Buildings were well preserved.
But don’t go in the summer it way way too hot!"
"As part of a TripADeal tour to China we visited the Forbidden City day 1. We got the clearest blue skies, which also meant extreme heat!
We spent hours only touching on each courtyard area, and seeing the amount of buildings and rooms. The size of the Forbidden City is something that can only be experienced for yourself. There is little seating or resting areas so do make sure you can walk for hours and it would be better to visit when it is cooler than 45degrees."
"Every time when i visit Beijing, I would go to the Forbidden City, to look at the old architectures, garden and the old Chinese staff. Very historical and interesting."
"I love this great royal palace! It is a piece of beautiful art! The ancient Chinese architecture in wood building is amazing if you love this sort of beauty.

At this a half day or a day would be more recommended though it is required more than a day to check out this whole palace where they are open to the public.

I love it!"
"If you don’t get a chance to book your tickets in advance, you have to make sure to be there before 10am. There are millions of Chinese with their umbrellas heading that way. You HAVE TO bring your passport with you as it will be checked by security before you even enter. And after you paid, your passport is your ticket.
The grounds are huge and the Chinese don’t wait in line for a photo opportunity."
"Everybody hear about this place, it's very famous. It's probably the most visited place in China, I guess. However, most rooms are not allowed access to go in. Basically all you can see is from outside. You don't really see much as to how people used to live there, there lives and stories. There are numerous treasures and art collections that have not been exhibited. I think those are the real Forbidden City to explore."
We were amazed by the size of the forbidden city and once again Nancy was a great guide. The forbidden city is a once in the life time experience.
"My wife and I and 80000 of our best friends visited the forbidden city today. Book ahead, there isn't always tickets available at the gate, Make sure your driver takes you near the front gate,you can't enter at other gates any more and it's a damn long walk! Use a guide or rent the automatic guide. If you use the auto guide from low his directions for a while if you don't want to meet ss the major highlights. turn left when you enter, go up on top of the front gate and see the calligraphy exhibit and walk along the wall to the, how the palace was built exhibition, then head back to the centre walk to pick up the auto guide.. Enjoy the architecture, there isn't anything to see in any of the major buildings, just the outside. I forget which palace houses the ceramics exhibition, don't miss it, it is centred around a half built marble palace which is an awesome photo shoot. And.. The air-conditioning in the bronze exhibit building is the best... Enjoy a wonder of the world!!"
"How did they build all these??? Amazing, breathtaking. Enormous place, gardens, trees, plants, ""houses"". Get there early, 8 in the morning or even earlier. Lots of things to see and a long queue..."
"A lot of walking in a massive area inside the city. Don't go on a hot day as your legs and feet will feel it. Nothing major to see inside as it is empty but it is a historical site and worth the effort considering back in the days of old, you had to be important to be seen but now it is open to the public and beware huge crowds in the thousands visit daily as it is a big draw card. Bathrooms are few and paths are uneven, so wear great walking shoes as it is easy to turn an ankle. You must have a guide with you to explain we did and after that he let as roam free and meet up later. We were on a group of 8 so a meeting point if got lost was always something we discussed."
I'd have to say this place is way too crowded. Just go for few pictures and leave for other good spots in beijing.
"This is one big place in Beijing!! Best idea is to hire or arrange to have a guide take you around and also make sure that your group is small with 4-6 people at the most or best is to have a private tour 1-2 people, which we chose. There is absolutely so much people within the entire complex and at every angle; it is easy to get lost as maps of the place are not posted around for you to follow. If you are in a small group and you decide to stop for a photo, you can easily loose your group and our guide is already 10 steps ahead in the crowd!
It is great to have the tour begin at the Tian'anmen Square as it is the entrance that leads into the Forbidden City - Palace Museum through an underground passageway.
We originally arranged a small group tour of 4-6 people but we lucked out as it turned out to be just the 2 of us as the others cancelled. Our guided arranged by our travel advisor was very enthusiastic to walk through the complex for more than 6 hours duration filling us with a vivid history and she would wait patiently while we were stopping for photos along the way.

There is just so much history here and a lot to see. With the immense crowds here, it can be overwhelming and tiring at the same time. Start early in the morning as it is cooler. there is less people, and you will have more energy. Renting a headset without a guide is not advisable as mentioned, maps are not that readily available to indicate which building is which. The halls, palaces, and adjoining buildings all look the same after awhile. Be prepared for the massive crowd, people pushing to see the interior of the buildings and cutting in lines. It is just not a cultural thing to say ""excuse me"" or ""pardon.""

You need to imagine yourself here during the times of the dynasties to fully enjoy the visit at the Forbidden City- Palace Museum. Definitely a must see when you are in Beijing! Don't miss views of the Hall of Supreme Harmony-- your very 1st view of the very large buildings you will pass in Forbidden City and the colorful Nine Dragon Screen."
"By standing in front of the Tianamen plaza you can see the 100 sq acres of beautifull palaces inside, a day is not enough to see everything........"
"The place is great but the service is horrible! I ordered my ticket on their official website by my passport for next day and followed the instructions to pick up the ticket at a ticket booth near the main entrance at that day I planned to visit. I waited 45 minutes in a pouring rain and all my clothes was completely wet. When it was my turn to pick up my ticket, the person in the booth told me I don’t need to pick up my ticket as the official website claims, all I need to do is JUST showing my passport at the main entrance to get into Forbidden City!!!! I was very upset and angry!!!"
"It is crowded. In the summer it is hot, but a visit to Beijing must include the Forbidden City. Watch ""The Last Emperor"" before you go.
Get there early and go with a guided tour - I arrived at 11:30am and the english speaking guides were no longer available. There is an audio guide available that knows where you are in the palace, but it is not the same as a proper guide."
"If you can brave the hordes of people, this is a must see historical site. Make sure you see the interior of the main buildings, the treasury (extra charge but very reasonable) and the Imperial Garden.

Reserve your tickets in advance. Make sure students have their school IDs of you want to receive a discount. You can do so via the Internet although a bit difficult for Foreign passport holders. I recommend having the concierge at your hotel book the tickets for you in advance of your trip. They do sell out so reserving tickets in advance is highly recommended during the summer months. Make sure that your concierge print out your reservation because the ticketing area at the site has a difficult time finding your reservation under your passport number. The process will be much smoother if you have the online reservation document.

You can plan to spend a minimum of 2 to 3 hours. Also when you exit on the north side of the for bidden city walls, it may be worth it to go to the park across the street which has beautiful vistas and lovely gardens."
"back in the days of old this was a place where very few people would ever get to see. now open to the public it,s well worth a couple of hours out of your day to see and hear how the emperor lived. a must while you,re in beijing"
"No visit to Beijing would be complete without a visit to the fabled Forbidden City. A massive site, it consists of layer upon layer of spectacular palace buildings and open courtyards. It's like peeling an onion - the layers just keep coming.

Being one of the world's premier tourist spots in the world's most populous country, it's no surprise that a visit to the Forbidden City involves fighting your way through thousands upon thousands of people. Tour groups are everywhere, and if you are part of one of them, don't lose sight of your group's identifying flag, as you may never find them again if you get separated from your group. Massive crowds are just a fact of life in China, and at tourist sites like this, multiply by a factor of ten.

Bathrooms are hard to find, so plan accordingly. The ancient brick walking surface inside can be very uneven, so be very careful walking,"
"Came in the summer. Place was very crowded with students, families and tour groups. It was quite warm as well but it was worth the experience!"
A piece of very interesting history and well kept grounds and building. Definitely Worth a look. Get the full history of the emperor and concubines.
"We were there on a rainy afternoon in July. It was a bit crowded. The people here (especially the older people) seem to love Chairman Mao. They come here to see where he is ""sleeping"" :). I didn't see any other white people the whole time we were here. So it is mostly locals that go there on rainy days in July. And they definitely like to have their picture taken with Americans. It didn't bother us any though. They were very friendly."
"I'm afraid the heat and humidity were the theme for much of our visit and it was particularly harsh at the Forbidden City. With a ""real feel"" heat index of 110F we had little desire to linger among the crowds on a Sunday in July. I'd probably recommend a visit during spring or fall for someone interested in the substantial historic significance of the site."
"This place is very large, and nice for walking. I slammed through it in a morning before I had to fly out. Many pagodas with lots of people taking pictures of one of the many throne rooms. Was worth it. Some of the best views and photos are of the exterior with the moat and what appear to be weeping willow type tress."
Deefinitely a must see. Unfortunately it was raining during our tour but to see and be in Forbidden City is a once in a lifetime experience.
"Entering the gate of the forbidden city, we can see many ancient China's buildings. What we can learn including architecture, histories, buildings' usage....
Make sure wear the comfortable shoes and dress. Bring the bottled water."
"We were there in August and it was terrible crowded.
Don’t expect too much, it’s not a palace as Versailles or the Residenz in Wuerzburg
Be there early as they limit the number of tickets and try to buy online"
"My teenage sons and I were captivated by the history, architecture and scale of this place! Go early as the heat is brutal!"
"Prepare comfortable shoes as you would be doing a lot of walking as you explore the old palace grounds. The massive scale of the place is impressive and as you jostle with the huge crowd, immerse yourself in the grandeur of this historical site. We visited Tiananmen Tower before entering and we spent an entire morning and past lunchtime for both locations. The food in the Forbidden City was mediocre and expensive so you may wish to have some small snacks with you to last your visit.

There was a new attraction within the Forbidden City grounds that allowed paying patrons to enjoy a VR tour of the palace grounds with explanation of the architectural considerations. Only 10mins long (sorry I can't recall how much it cost!) so for a quick and brief understanding of the history associated with thr grounds, you could consider this!

Also, dont miss the different exhibitions of the old furniture and artifacts, cutlery and jewellery used by the royal family! Interesting and delightful to appreciate their lavish lifestyle."
"It’s a must see sight but it helps to research prior. I purchased a ticket a day in advance, they typically sell out quickly during tourist season. You need your passport to vet the ticket at the entrance. Getting through security wasn’t difficult but you are herded through with thousands of people. If you stay along the center front to back you can walk it in an hour without stopping but as impressive as it was, the palaces repeat. Go off to the east and west to actually see anything up close and enter the display halls. Warning, you will be hustled going in and out to buy something or pay for a tour. Just get the audio tour or book a guide."
"The Forbidden city, now known as the palace museum continually took my breath away when we visited! With 900 courtyards and supposedly 9999 rooms, the place is huge so I would recommend a few hours or more here. The imperial gardens at the back of the palace are worth leaving some time to explore. Would definitely recommend to anyone in Beijing, China or the world in general! Can’t comment on the price as it was included in our group tour of China."
The Forbidden City is massive!! It took us four hours to walk around the site. Do pay the 20 Rmb and get a english head set that talks you through all the sites.
A palace built few centuries ago by the Ming Dynasty. This is as big as a city. Many buildings but quite similar in architecture and design. Chinese historical collections. A must visit if one is in Beijing. Carry water or juice with you. Entry ticket required.
"Don't get me wrong in this review in that this is a must to visit! However, for us it was just too busy and rather repetitive in structure of buildings with there not being much to see inside the buildings, so it was a bit of a slog in searing heat from one bit to another. We were really looking forward to this bug ended up being underwhelmed by the whole experience."
"The place is very big. Didn't mean a lot to me because don't know Chinese history. But overall it was a very interesting place to go. A lot of people and there is a small fee to get in. And they will take your lighter, like everywhere else in China."
It is one of the most incredible places to visit. You will arrive throug Tiananmen . It is really crowded so be prepared to push and make way with your elbows.
"China has a rich diversity of history, even Beijing was the capital since the 12th century. In this place you can see how Beijing weer developed from dynasty to dynasty."
"Some practical tips:

only 80000 tickets per day are issued. Either buy them online (price should be close to the equivalent of 60 yuan), have your hotel buy them for you or show up early. I wouldn't recommend getting the overpriced tours that they try to sell you at the entrance (500-ish yuan)

You will have to pass the security check for Tiananmen Square. Add an extra 30 minutes for this.

Weekends are hell. Queues for the Tiananmen Square checks will be 1,5-2 hours and tickets will be sold out really fast."
Amazing beauty and power in this historic site! Garden at the end is worth the walk! So detailed and visually overwhelming! A must see!
"second to only the great wall in amazing things we seen in beijing area. The size of the place was remarkable, as well as the ornate ancient buildlings which are all still intact and standing. Truly should be one of the wonders of the ancient world."
"If you traveled to Beijing, you better go to the Forbidden City. It's like going to New York City and not having pizza."
"It makes a huge impression even in spite of the crowd of visitors. I really recommend. Instead of standing in a long queue to the main entrance, you can enter the park east of the main entrance and avoid the queues. It costs literally a few yuan."
Only have a few hours in Beijing then this is the must go bring your passport and water expect lots of people and to be fascinated the whole time
Wow! Wow! Wow! That is the impression of this amazing place. Never did we imagine we would visit here! It is so interesting and the tour we had as part of an organised cruise excursion was excellent. We heard many historical facts but not too many to make it dull and the information was fascinating. Being able to walk through the courtyards and touch the huge doors and enjoy the views ( despite the huge crowds which makes it a little difficult at times to enter each courtyard) was one of the experiences of a lifetime. A wonderful visit.
Make sure to book in advance to avoid waiting queues. We asked the hotel to book for us and we just has to show our passport to get in without waiting. Foresee at least half a day for the visit of this big attraction.
"Although we visited on very crowded and equally hot summer day it was breathtaking to be in the Forbidden City. I have dreamt of seeing this for decades. We found interestingly, we were also a point of interest, with stares or requests to my daughter to pose for picture. The complex is so much larger than I had ever thought. We walked through on a private tour. We were given so much information that we would not have known otherwise. It was great to skirt through the crowds. Definitely a must see!"
The Palace is huge. Avoid weekend and Public Holiday as it is very crowded even on weekday. Comfy shoes and water is a must
Visiting the forbidden city is definitely a must when in Beijing but you also must be aware that you will be surrounded by tens of thousands of other visitors and long waiting lines everywhere (even in bad weather) beginning with the security checks and ticket office. You could easily spend many hours there to look at the different palaces and get their history with help of audio guides but it's also difficult to do among the huge crowds and you definitely need to have your passport along. Still an amazing place! Opposite is a large park (Yingshan Park) on a hill also worth visiting.
If you are in Beijing this is a must-visit place. It is huge and beautiful. Will take you about 3-4 hours...
"A historical place, Kings Fortess, very crowded and lot of walking to do. Must take a guide - human/Earphone.

Do take a lot of water as temperature becomes unbearable during Summer times."
"We took a tour through here and we were amazed at the size of it. As with a lot of places in China it was very busy. The buildings are wonderful, the detail in the architecture and the colours are great. Our tour guide gave us lots of information about it's history, the fact that it used to be the Imperial palace during the Ming and Qing dynasties. The common people were not allowed to be in the city which is why it got it's name, as it was forbidden to them. From the entrance to the exit there's plenty to see inside and out. Give yourself plenty of time to really wander around and explore it."
"Forbidden palace is crowded place, and I think it is not suitable for little children to walk around. It takes to much time 2-3 hours. There is no more places to sit. If you need water in it, it's really hard to find till end. You should take min two 500ml cold water for one. And hat, sun glasses..."
"With so many people wanting to view this historic site it was impossible to fully appreciate the magnitude and splendour of The City.
But it is well worth seeing. One exhibit shows the original construction and design and was so interesting. Allow at least a couple hours to view. If you haven’t seen the Forbidden City then you haven’t seen Beijing.
Wear walking shoes and don’t forget the brolly for the sun and sun cream.
Your Passport or I.D. to gain entry is required: no I.D. no entry. (As with other sites in the area). We paid 60 RMB (being seniors) at the ticket office. Our passport was our ticket on paying. At 9 o’clock it only took 1/2 an hour queuing.
On site eateries plentiful, or take a picnic: there’s an abundance of seating and eating areas. As with any place worth seeing the place is extremely popular, but don’t be put off when seeing the throng - the queues move rapidly. We didn’t bother with Guides or audio gadgets we did what we wanted when we wanted saw all the areas at our own pace and independently."
Splendid Chinese Architecture. This place is massive! Hard to understand the vastness without seeing it in person. Be prepared for long lines entering in through Tiananmen Square.
"Obviously you can’t go to china and now see the forbidden city! Beautiful place with lots of history! An insider tip! Take a guide with you, that way you don’t have to cue up!"
"The Forbidden City is fascinating, from the imposing portrait of Mao that hangs above the entrance to the high red walls that line its exit. Within, the hundreds of buildings that make up this palace complex, together with their courtyards, walkways and gardens, grandly evoke China’s imperial past. Once the exclusive domain of the emperor, his family and court, the Forbidden City is a marvel both in its massive size and the delicate beauty of its architecture. Westerners used to visiting European palaces should be forewarned: There are no restored and curated royal living spaces to explore; some building interiors can be glinpsed from doorways, but this is largely an outdoor experience. We had a private tour guide to help us navigate, but for independent travelers English audio guides are available, which can be dropped offf at the exit. (This is a one-way visit; don’t expect to return to the entrance.) Of course there will be crowds, and in summer there will be intense heat and hunidity. But this UNESCO World Heritage Site is undeniably one of the great must-see tourist attractions anywhere."
"There is nothing indoors. You walk through a series of gates with limited sections along the walls of buildings to stay out of the rain. After 2 hours of mostly standing in the rain getting drenched, though my rain cape and clothes, it was difficult to enjoy or appreciate the historical site. We went on a Tuesday and I’m not sure if so crowded because it was closed on Monday. Might go back if better weather conditions exist."
Go with a tour guide. Don’t expect good photo opportunities. The place is well maintained. In summer expect huge crowds and hot and humid weather. Lines are to be expected. Take time to go to Behei Park - less visited and it is tranquil. The history of the site is well worth the visit and it is a don’t miss in Beijing.
"while we werent up at the crack of dawn we did get there around 10. the lines and masses of people moved along swiftly, we never felt like it took unnecessarily long and it was all really worth the effort. we bought our tickets quickly and got the audio guide- there'll be people trying to seel you private tours, but we found the audio guide to be quite enough information.

we went on a weekday out of the school holiday season, but was still quite full."
"Very large and very busy, it was impossible (too many visitors) to go inside the museum. Very impressive."
"To understand a bit of China you need to visit this museum. But be warned, it gets very hot and crowded during the summer school holidays even with the 80,000 tickets quota a day. So buy your tickets online and skip the ticket lines.

There are audio guides for hire, but we were really glad that we had a guide to take us to the most interesting places, sit us in shady spots while she explained the history and took us to the places with the cleanest bathrooms with the shortest lines and places to buy the coolest drinks (cool bottles of drinks sell out fast!) .

I was lucky to visit in the late 1980s and had the place comparatively to myself compared to now. It was a much better experience.

Note that there is very little to see inside the places as most of the best exhibits are in the Taiwan national Museum--good thing too or they would have likely been destroyed during the cultural revolution."
"The Forbidden City has long been romanticised within the alluring Chinese history and culture. I was therefore a little hesitant of being disappointed from my expectations.
I was not but, neither did I leave enamored with it.

It is well organised and a easy procession through it but, to get those Instagram worthy photos then you will be disappointed because there are just too many people to get a clear photo, or you are just going to have to have extreme patience and/or luck.

If you are a westerner then be prepared for you to also become a bit of an attraction. Many people will take photos of you

I am glad I saw it, I enjoyed the day out, I just left wishing it could have been better."
You can spend quite some time in the Forbidden City. When you think you reached the last building there is another. Only thing that is missing is all the fabulous furniture that was taken away by the enemy. Loved seeing all the blooming cherry blossom trees.
Buy the tickets online to ensure you get to go in. Has daily quota of 70000 which fills up very fast. Also bring passport and go straight to the entrance. No need to exchange online vouchers to ticket. It is a huge place with lots of separate palaces or halls. The exhibits is barely visible amidst dusty glass windows. The audio aid automatic comes on when you reach the specific place. The crowd is crazy. It was pretty stressful on a hotday. But being in Beijing will be incomplete if you dont visit the forbidden city. I like it 18 years ago when it was not so crowded and audio had Roger Moore voice explaining the history of how the big marble piece was transported rather than what a great conservation job.
"The palace has been a place of wonder and mystery for over 500 years. This place is pretty big, so allow enough time to have a good look around (about half of a day). Wear your walking shoes.
It has audio guide in some languages and you can set it yourself by that device that you hired. I set it on English, but the explanations were too short and incomplete. You can get some information by reading some boards during your visit. They were interesting but could be so much better."
Be prepared to take your time as it is massive and make sure you bring comfortable shoes! Loved it!. Must See!
"Some chinese girl are wandering around forbidden city to deceive you!
They offer you a walk and small talk then inviting to a cafe, after drinking a coffee you will receive a thousands yuan bill!!
They are friend of cafe
Be careful"
"Wear your walking shoes and bring water. This entire area is much more expansive than I anticipated. We enjoyed the Forbidden City and well as all of the adjacent parks and neighborhoods. Plan on at least 4 hours of walking and exploring. We were approached by many ""tour guides"" who were really just sweet talking con men trying to tell us certain attractions were closed so we would go on their tour. Do not be fooled. A tour guide is not necessary for this area and none of the sites were closed as these con men had told us. Tip: In this area-taxis are easier than figuring out bus routes and don't do the pedi-cabs unless you negotiate price in advance and can handle a crazy ride."
We visited this (huge) site as part of a recent tour. Fascinating and rewarding to wander the immense grounds and see the huge and impressive buildings. Recommended.
"We had Monday set aside to visit the Forbidden City. Guess what it was closed. We took a number 5 bus to Jingshan Park and walked up the hill. Four temples each devoted to the seasons and the view from the top gives you a good idea of the Forbidden City and all the buildings.
The traditional Chinese tea house at the bottom of the steps is great for tasting different teas."
"I have been to Beijing several times in the last 10 years. Last visit to Beijing I took a colleague to the forbidden city. No more cash entry, all through phone apps which are linked to Chinese bank (which was new). You don't have that? Be prepared to find someone who does. There are plenty of friendly guides that will do this for you at a price (about $40/person but you get them to tour you through the city).
Also, bring your passport. You will need it to get into the general area (Tiananmen square etc.). Also ensure you have a plan of getting there and leaving. Taxis are non-existent for casual access. You need to order them via app (which if you are not Chinese, you likely do not have).
Tip: start at south gate entrance (Tiananmen square area) and work your way to the north gate (no entrance there and once you emerge, no taxis, so make sure you have a strategy)."
This was our second room time to the Forbidden City. Always amazing. July is not a good time to visit due to the high temperatures. A must do for anyone visiting Beijing.
"Crowded on a rainy day.

Kids equated the Forbidden City with the other gardens/homes we had seen in China."
"Went here from Tiananmen East metro, it took me 1 hour to enter the palace due to lengthy security check. Bring the passport as it is needed for the ticket. The palace itself is huge with many buildings inside. Didn’t manage to visit them all due to time constraint, but the best route is to just go straight from the entrance and go forward. That way you will get most of the main building and gate.

Took the automatic audioguide for 40RMB. The best part is that it is available in Indonesian (my native language), but it is not worth it as the information is not that much, and the GPS accuracy is abysmal."
"We went there with my boyfriend straight away from the airport after 15hrs flight. It was a Sunday afternoor, we got there around 3pm, they are closing at 4.30pm so we were all way in a rush. As far as we got there they told us, we cant get in. We were staying in Shanghai just for one night and on Monday they are closed. Even if we explained them out situation they didnt let us in. Stuff were not helpful at all. Noone speaks English. Def the worst experience You can get after long flight and first time in China."
You can not visit China without seeing The Forbidden City. Our Tour Guide June (Odynovo) was very knowledgable & made our visit so very interesting. I first visited The Forbidden City in 1982 & was spellbound then. This visit was the same. Enhanced by our wonderful Guide June who provided us with just the right amount of information to keep us immersed in its atmosphere.
"This city into the city of Beijing worth a visit, it’s all made of wood! Go through all the main buildings with the tour guide explaining all the details of the emperor’s life and his family. We’ve really enjoyed it, suggest everyone to visit it at least once!"
Great stop for sightseeing. Admission can be difficult if you do not have access to WiFi to download tickets before arriving at the ticket counter. Very few directions in English but well worth these obstacles to gain entrance. Quite busy so arrive early to avoid long lines. I spent around three hours but could have spent more time if not for the oppressive heat and humidity.
The complex is huge and is beautiful to look at. The 2 problems are that the place is very crowded and you don't get to see much besides the buildings. The buildings are beautiful though.
"It's impossible to express the absurd enormity of the Forbidden City. I spent hours wandering through with friends, and it was an amazing experience, one of the highlights of my trip. Don't miss exploring the Palace Gardens, there are some amazing spots for photos.

Make sure to take water, especially in summer. It gets very hot and bringing in your own bottled water is the easiest option."
"This forbidden city located north side of Tianmen Square. You may skip weekends and holidays , it's too crowded , foreign people can go trough another line , take your passport. Recommended you to visit"
"A must see when you're in Beijing, closed on Mondays during the peak seasons. Buy tickets online to avoid the queue to buy tickets. It will be very crowded, bring hat/umbrella/fans. Start early, you have to pass through multiple security checks from leaving the subway.
Mostly just the old buildings and different palaces, not a lot of things like jewelry or furniture, ornaments. Good to rent an audio guide (34rmb for foreign language, 20 rmb for chinese) that automatically explains when you reach each palace building."
"Unlike many historical buildings world wide this is just vast expanse of building shells with no relics inside or anything to give you an understanding of what happened inside. Thank goodness our guide was on hand to provide an insight. In addition, no tour guide means big cues and to see what - empty buildings. Sorry but very disappointed."
"1) I really like the architecture, no matter how weather is I enjoyed it.

2) There are so many people.
I woke up really early to get there at 8:30 am and half of the word had the same idea as me.
They have barriers EVERYWHERE, so I was there at 9:30 am.

3) I have to peal my cucumber in security check, because you can’t go there with a knife.

——————————
It’s good to go there just once, it’s enough - it’s my opinion. (because of tons of people)

Recommended: Taking pictures all the way, the exit is in the another side."
"It is an impressive place but its way too crowded to enjoy it. The tickets should be limited, it is simply insane!! I wouldnt return"
"This spot is well worth the 5km trek from start to finish.
The tour is one way, so you start at the front and exit at the back. A tour guide is recommended as the history is rich and worth understanding. The gardens at the very back are very beautiful. Bring an umbrella as if it rains there is not much shelter."
If u visit Beijing you must visit the forbidden city . be warned make sure u have good walking shoes as its massive and theres a lot of walking. at the exit if you a fit enough you can walk up the hill to the pagoda where the views if the forbidden city are awesome .
"Its the largest imperial palace in the world.

Its big and having a guide to explain the different areas is definitely the way to go. There is so much to take in that a guide will point out the highlights.

It was raining when we went so the site was not at its best and we struggled with the rain.

Lots of interesting statues- example stone cranes for longevity. Interesting architecture just a shame about the rain."
"Forbidden City, or Gu Gong in Chinese, is a must see place in China. The old palace is well kept and full of stunning architecture marvels. However, to ensure a enjoyable visit, make sure you do the following:
- Buy tickets online, and remember to bring your passport on the day!
- Try NOT to enter through TianAnMen, but through East Side to Wu Men instead. Otherwise, you will have to go through lengthy security check.
- Hire one of those voice guide devices.
- Watch for you little kids, there are plenty spots for them to get hurt...
- Don't go on Monday, as the museum is closed."
2nd time come here & previous one already 20 years ago. a bit diff with my memory of it. seem smaller than previous. i don't know is that close some area or not but that still worth to visit.
"The Forbidden City is synonymous with the Chinese Emperors and with their capital Beijing. For centuries this was the seat of power and if you have a sense of Chinese history you will love the place. To walk through the many gates, to experience where history was made, to see the wonderful workmanship… it’s almost too much to take in. In fairness, there were huge crowds of tourists when I visited but do not let this be off putting. Just move from place to palace, from one golden gate to the next, to the wonderful oasis of a park in the middle. Here you are in the epicentre of Chinese civilisation. Don’t miss it."
"We stopped in at the Forbidden City in the morning. Huge crowds of people were streaming through the entire time we were there.

As you wander through the site, each space becomes more and more spectacular. Loved having a guide to tell me things that I didn’t know about ahead of time.

Coming with a guide allowed us to skip a massive line waiting for security (I think). Strongly recommend this.

Fantastic site to visit. Absolutely fantastic!"
"Legendary city mark, unique, imperial, glamour...nice place to spend a especial afternoon.Only avoid going during weekends, I believe that you will find less people Monday or Tuesday moorning."
"To really understand the history of the city, I think this is a must-see location. The palace seems to go on and on with so many different rooms, courtyards and buildings. Definitely very crowded though no matter when you visit since it is one of the most frequently visited and well-known historical sites that make up the city's culture."
"Good place to know their culture m, ancient architecture, about their kings etc. Nees to walk about 7 kilometers through the palace. Recommending to to travel with very small children. Make sure to wear a hat or cap Andy bring 2-3 liter of water."
"For people looking to visit the Forbidden city it is a great sight to see. However you definitely need to plan in advance before you go if you are a foreigner. You will need to book your tickets in advance. Would suggest that you go also earlier in the day as it will get crowded. Very crowded!
We went in early July and it was both crowded and hot. Do make sure to dress appropriately with breathable clothing and lots of fluids.
Once you enter there is only one way to get through so do not plan on coming out the same way you went in either."
"It is an amazing construction, full of history.
Very close to the Tiananmen Square, very crowded, full of chinese tourists."
We thought we were just going to a palace but the different building go on and on. It took nearly 2 hours to walk through the palace and gardens. Great visit.
"I have visited the Forbidden City multiple times over my 9 years in China. It is always exciting and something different to see every time. For a quick tour (about 2 hours) you can walk down the middle of the city and see the major buildings which will remind you of scenes in the Last Emperor. If you have time there are museum areas on the left side as you walk through, and on the right side are many historical areas most people miss. Another added feature when you visit the Forbidden City is you can first take a walk thru Tiananmen square before you go into the city. It is just across the thoroughfare from the front entrance."
"I visited the Forbidden City some years ago and this time there was a lot of security to get through before we could get in. They say that you need your passport to get a ticket but actually they accepted a copy. They also want you to buy tickets online but the site comes up all in Chinese however you can buy a ticket inside, it's just not well signposted or advertised so you have to be tenacious. We were there in July and the heat and humidity were unbearable. It limited us for walking and therefore spoiled our enjoyment of the site. The restaurant on site is excellent though. It's air-conditioned too and not overpriced but very busy. There are a lot of different buildings but once you've seen a few they all seem pretty similar so don't kill yourself trying to see them all."
"Firstly, I will say this is a must see in Beijing. You don't go to Beijing and not come here. But I will say, compared to its European counterparts it doesn't quite stack up for me.

It's massively huge, the audio guide is informative and the major buildings are impressive. But, (and I'm sure this is western ignorance) I feel if you see the first building you have basically seen them all.

Try to avoid the weekends for a visit. We went on a Saturday and I've never been amongst more humans in my life.

I do, however, recommend the park North of the Forbidden City. It is peaceful, tranquil and offers a great view of the surrounds. Don't miss this if you go to the FC. It's only 10 or so RMB"
An absolute must if in Beijing. I strongly suggest that you use one of the local guides that usually stand by the entrance. They are slightly cheaper than to use earplugs and can personalize your visit and give you much more detail. We were 8 people and it was perfect. Don't forget to visit the shop there are lovely books and prints. Enjoy!
"Incredible architecture that transports you to the time of ancient Chinese dynasties.
You need to get the tickets well in advance, or get them through a tour.
I visited it on a Sunday and it was packed.
Unfortunately access to inside of the building is not allowed.
For maximum experience I recommend some short reading about the history of the city before arrival."
"What can I say? A trip to the Forbidden City is a real privilege and I felt so humbled to walk where Emporeor's in history have walked before.

A few hints:

-there is hardly any shade so take an umbrella if visiting in Summer
-there is limited info in English so hire a guide
-the ticket booth is hard to find so try to pre-buy tickets (n.b. the ticket booth for foreginers is different to the local ticket booth. P.s. bring your passport for ID - mandatory)
-the toilets are gross, avoid if you can
-limited food on site, just water and snacks (I think corn)
-pop into the small air conditioned museum for a rest if it's too hot outside
-expect it to be very busy, especially on the weekend
-prepare to have your bags inspected by police and screen before you enter

Finally, ENJOY the beautiful space"
"Of course if you go to China, this is one of the places you need to tick off. Avoid public holidays and still expect a lot of people. Give yourself the better part of a day to truely experience the place. Beware scammers ""Hi you are from _____ I went to art school there. Please come and see my paintings. Have a great day !"
"I have visited the Forbidden Palace numerous times. My suggestion is to read up on its history before going and then go explore! Managed tours don’t take enough time to let you wander and explore the many smaller, beautiful areas in this large complex. The names of each building alone are worth learning. I also like to walk around the outside to taken in the massive wall structure. Always worth the time to visit!"
I joined a tour for this. It was great to gain information as we walked through the forbidden city. Wonderful experience!
"You can't really be in Beijing without visiting the Forbidden City, that's a given. And it's beautiful and historically important etc. Yet, suggest that you set your expectations about some things:
1. Enterence to the halls is not allowed. You can look inside and take pictures but no more. Considering the masses that do exactly the same, you are lucky to stand for a minute at take a quick pic before you need to clear your space for someone else
2. Audio tours are location activated without human control. As you switch zones, just by strolling on, narration switches automatically, and you may end up in suspence of skipped information...
3. Coming in, you have signs about online ticket purchase. It doesn't work well for foreigners so don't bother. Go further in to the ticket booth.
4. Don't forget your passport! You need it for police scanning plus your ticket is electronically associated with it

Now just go ahead and enjoy yourselves :)"
"I went with a small tour group on an incredibly busy, rainy day. Still, it was an amazing experience. You feel the history of China with every step through this beautifully preserved monument to the country's past. As an American, it certainly puts the short history of our country in perspective. While the history is spectacular and fascinating, it is also quite disturbing to think you are standing where soldiers, eunuchs, concubines (with bound feet), and other oppressed members of society stood under the rule of centuries of emperors and the empress."
"Chinese culture is very fascinating and it was so enlightening doing this tour. The tour guide was knowledgeable, and don't leave without touching the gold knobs, it's good luck! (for wealth apparently)"
"China, has alot of history in this particular place, Forbidden City. If you ever get the chance to visit this place, please do so. It is certainly educational at this historical place. I would certainly recommend."
Nice views but pretty lacking in historic prose. It’d be worth having a guide to make it more contextual.
We visited the Forbidden city with a privet tour guide. Plenty of them around at the entrance RMB 250. Glad we did as there are so many people in the city. Because the the volume of visitors and the temperature it becomes uncomfortable. But with a good guide you can get to see all the sites with ease. my suggestion don't go with a large tour group as this will take forever to get through. Well worth a visit but be prepared to do some walking. Take water with you as the price inside the city doubles.
"This is a beautiful area, in perfect condition. Our guide told us it's rarely used (which seems a waist). The history it holds is amazing. Again I would recommend a tour guide if really interested in details.(We're from US) Dragon Lady history is worth it! We had a toddler with us and a stroller is difficult. We carried the stroller up stairs, walkways and shop entrances. I highly suggest wearing sun hats, sun glasses and buying a ""sun"" block umbrella. Very useful!"
Truly amazing cultural heritage site with a rich history and spectacular Instagram moments. Make sure you have adequate digital memory to take as many pictures and videos you can. Get your passports ready since it is required to purchase tickets to enter. Plan your day accordingly since Tian'anmen has many sites to see.
"Well, you have to see it...take a tour, it definitely adds to the experience to know all the historical context. but it's not overwhelming in any way except size."
"Awesome in scale, one gets a sense of what a great empire China was in the period 1600-1900! Items are well displayed."
A five star treat. Will not disappoint. Walk through Tianamen square to see mural of Mao and enter through that gate. Audio guide available and well worth the cost to fully appreciate the history and significance of the complex. Its huge and needs at least 2 hours to get through
Was interesting for the first 10 minutes then it became same same. Quite crowded and people are a bit pushy. You will do lots of walking.
"Had a personal guide from Gray Line Tours....felt that she ""rushed"" us through this. Was informative but if we were to do it again....with another guide."
"The Forbidden City, also known as the Palace Museum, was the former imperial palace of the Chinese royal families. It’s a huge complex and it’s best to wear comfortable walking shoes to explore this place. There is not much shade so a hat and sunscreen would be recommended for sunny days. Some tourists were using umbrellas to provide shade.

The Forbidden City is located at the North end of Tiananmen Square. The only entrance is through the Gate of Heavenly Peace but there are three other exits. It's closed on Mondays.

There are washrooms, gift shops, and restaurants on site. Signs are in both Chinese and English. It helps to have a map and plan ahead on what you what to see. Expect crowds and many tour groups."
"... The Forbidden City covers an area of about 72 hectares (178 acres) with a total floor space of approximately 150,000 square meters (1,600,000 square feet). It consists of 90 palaces and courtyards, 980 buildings and 8,704 rooms ... listed as a World Cultural Heritage Building in 1987, it was built in the Ming Dynasty (1368-1644) and the construction of this group of buildings took fourteen years from 1406 to 1420 ...

During winter you need fingered glove, during summer a silk parasol !!!"
"It's really big but extremely crowded despite the fact size. I realize I was in a tour group myself, but it was insane how many tour groups there were. I loved the history and artistry, but even after they set limits on the number of people to visit I felt something is lost seeing it when it's so crowded.

It looked miserable for folks with mobility issues, very few ramps and many obstacles.

If you're still up to going get tickets in advance."
"Arrived at The gates and was approached by a Tour Guide called Thomas. I accepted his offer as a Tour guide all in good faith. He gave me his Card but asked me not to discussed this with my hotel. (Red flag Number 1). As we rushed through the site he also mentioned that he was approached by a Muslim customer who tried to get his fee lower on which his comments was he anyway doesn't like Muslims. Also all the time mentioned that he will get 5% commission on anything I bought in the site. I didn't buy anything from the souvenir shops but at the end he took me to a tea shop for a tea tasting and ceremony. After the ceremony they offered that I could buy some tea. I did buy some tea. When I had to pay I said to him this sound like a lot but did not have any idea how much as it was, as it was my first day in China. I asked him about it and all explanations was given this tea now older than the ones I drank. I would have expect the tour guide which I paid would have give me sound advice. Its only when I got to the hotel that I realised how much they actually charged me. More than £250 for 3 packets of tea. I emailed him and his reply was that he was just neutral and he know (coming from a gay Guide) that gay Customers are picky and frugal( his own words). I really think that a Tourist site like this should ban any unprofessional guides like this and maybe have a register of professional ethical tour guides."
"Most of the buildings are empty, and you are not let in anywhere. So - to get the most out of the day - rent a guide. Get someone with english skills and passion for history, like Vivian from Discover Beijing.

Otherwise you will be in line for everything and will miss all the great stories about this place.

Another tip - go early!"
Much bigger than we expected. You have to visit because it’s on the list and it is huge but there isn’t a lot in the buildings in terms of furniture or artefacts. Mostly empty rooms. Fascinating though to learn about how the Emperors lived with hundreds of concubines and eunuchs. And it’s size is impressive — like most things in China. It’s huge!
"The Forbidden City dates back to Ming and Qing dynasties and was once the imperial residence. It is enormous and consists of 800 buildings with over 9,000 rooms, and is remarkable at its size and history. Fortunately we were able to spend a significant amount of time here, which is necessary considering its size. The buildings are magnificent and beautifully preserved. We spent a couple of hours walking through the various plazas and buildings, finally winding up at the Imperial Gardens. I would advise reading or watching the many documentaries about The Forbidden City to familiarize yourself with its rich history."
"It was nice to see.

Very big and cool to walk around to see the different buildings.

Good place to visit while in Beijing."
"Trip of a lifetime planned and executed by Odyssey Tours. This company has top of the industry guides, drivers, hotels, sites, local flavor and itinerary planning. Will continue to use their expertise if I am traveling in an area they service."
"We enjoyed this but once again steeped in history for the Chinese.
Worth a visit and easy to walk with not too many steps. Covers a big area though so a good half a day to walk around required."
I followed a lot of the reviews on how to visit here. 1. You have to go through security to even get on the street to enter. I came up from the subway exit to the south east - not a huge wait 10ms top first thing in the morning. You need your passport. 2. unless you want to go up the south tower don't buy tickets at the first booth you see - The tickets to enter the Palace is further along and to the right (I fell for that and even knew better). 3. Take this direction to avoid crowds (in some places have to yourself). Backtrack up the stairs along the main entrance and check out the exhibit then follow the guard walk to the right section of the palace and follow that as north as you can (you'll hit the jewel area and dragon wall). Then cross over to the far left section and make your way down south where there will be a cafe if you like. Then you've basically come to the beginning again where you can walk straight up through the middle. this is the most crowded areas but by that time you'll feel you saw enough and will be ready to go so you can breeze through this without the crowds annoying you too much as you make your way out while still seeing what they have. 4. When you exit beware the schemes (like a woman asking to go for tea or somewhere to chat). 5. you can easily spend over 5 hrs here.
"This is one of the most amazing experiences in China when you realise the scale of the empire! Each building is unique despite of the similarity, and walking through the palaces and squares you understand the real force of the Empire"
"We visited on 1st day in Bejing, a Sunday, walked and rode subway. Favorite was the Imperial Gardens - cooler respite on a 35C day. The grounds are massive; have to experience it to realize the grandeur. Lots of empty rooms, some luxury artifacts like palaces the world over. Security and ticket lines, but nothing huge. Virtual ticketing: pay fee, they scan/key-in ID number(passport) then just show passport at gate. Advance ticketing will eliminate one line, but we didn't have Alipay or similar (paid cash) and didn't want to do lots of advance planning. Middle-aged US couple in midst of mostly local tourists. Moderate sell effort by 1 lady in one of the myriad of Palace Museum Shops."
"Well, you may be impressed with the Great Wall as the #1 and I have to say that it is a tough choice between those two but the beauty and history of the forbidden city story has the edge, in my opinion.

Be prepared to dive into another world with your imagination, think of all the majesty of the imperial Chinese life. Hire a guide, if you don't, you will miss the essence and meanings hidden behind every statue and every window. Your guide must explain the meanings of the numbers, colors and shapes, nothing is left to chance. Every aspect of this magnificent man-made city has a meaning from the purposful location of the building to its shape to the number of windows, including the overall set up of the city layout with the low land in the south side and the high land in the north. The tea house, the garden, the locations and the stone animal status all have purpose or mystical meanings!

I will not spoil it for you not just to let you discover it yourself but because I feel words are going to undermine the experience.

Visiting Beijing without visiting the Forbidden City should be forbidden! :) Enjoy"
"This is a place you feel like you have to visit. I came in January last visit and it was cold but I did get to at least see something.

This visit was SO crowded on a Tuesday that it was shoulder to shoulder in 100 degrees for hours. The crowds pushed and shoved to the point of utter and complete misery. It was nearly impossible to stop to take it in due to the flow of people literally pushing you ahead like a flash flood!

We didn’t get to see much and it was not worth the bruises, frustration and heat to even try. Buy a post card someplace else.

If you do go BEWARE of the pick pockets."
I really love History so this was a very special adventure for myself and my husband and our Uncle and my Friend who also loved the whole adventure of Beijing the people are so warm and friendly and there is so much to see and do we also took a trip on the Bullet Train so advanced a must for anyone's Bucket List
"Really worth the visit, although would suggest going early to avoid the crowds and heat.

Admission cost was 60 yuan, there are people within the grounds selling ice creams and souvenirs etc."
You can only see it from a few yards away. It is manned by security and has a line ur not allowed to cross past. Overall not much to see apart from the architecture.
"If you've been to Versailles, you are familiar with where I'll be going with this. Obviously, this was very impressive and iconic. So is Versailles. But after drawing room number 49, you don't really need to see another French drawing room. The same notion applies here. There is little in the means of interior exhibits here. The Palace Museum in Taipei has FAR more exhibitions. This is more of a preserved living museum. Beautiful, but the many, many gates somewhat lack distinction from another. So it starts to seem like you're in something of a maze. It is very crowded. If you are coming from Tiananmen Square, after you cross the street through the tunnel, you can turn right shortly before you would enter the city through the main gate (under Mao) and pay 2 yuan to enter a side section with a temple. There's NOBODY in there and you hang to the left and run parallel with the LEGIONS of tourists trying to get into the city on the other side of the wall. It was a nice, peaceful walk that ended with a doorway in the wall on the left that dumped you directly at the gates to process your passport to gain entry. So it worked out really well. If you are not a Chinese citizen, it is difficult to purchase tickets beforehand. You need to use your passport number on the website where it has a space for Hong Kong/Taiwan residents. I am American and it worked fine. You can't use foreign payments the website and need WeChat to pay or Alipay, which are tricky without a Chinese bank account. We had a friend pay for ours. The city was very crowded and very hot in late June. Glad I went, though. NOTE: You can access the city from either Tiananmen subway station on Line 1. HOWEVER, the exit is in the back of the city and there are no subways immediately apparent. There are supposedly two stations back there but we could not find them. So be prepared to exit about a mile or more from where you started."
"This is the world's most visited museum, 17M visitors per annum, more than 2x the next most visited, The Louvre in Paris. And why? Because it's in China! So everything is in Chinese with some Chinglish. The audio guide I got was crap and died completely after 10min.

I can't see anything changing here anytime soon. I mean why would you? Your main audience is China, who cares about foreigners :p

Better bring your Wikipedia if you want to learn anything!"
"If you are visiting to Beijing, please do not forget to visit this place. If you are planning to visit on weekend , please expect heavy crowds."
"The Forbidden City had the same issue as the Temple of Heaven in terms of a very poor audio translation, such that it was very hard to follow and glean anything from the English tour. But the buildings themselves were a neat sight to see. I would recommend skipping past the initial large buildings as quickly as possible as the back area is much more interesting. The front buildings are certainly awe inspiring but the gardens and smaller buildings to had more shade and history."
"We visited the Forbidden City on our last day in Beijing. We had already been to several other tourist sites. Although I believe this is one of the most popular places to visit it was my least favorite. If you have a cultural connection to this landmark it may be a different experience. The security check was no big deal, we waited about 10 minutes. Once we were in people were mobbing to see inside the buildings. There are thousands of buildings on this 250 acres. Inside the buildings would be a single couch or table. Didn’t really make much sense to me. The buildings are very beautiful but all look the same. If you have days in Beijing put it on the list but if you only have 1-day I recommend skipping this."
Great area to view the vast walls of Forbidden City and other parks and areas of this massive complex very safe.
Its very historic and nice mesume in beijing its also near to tample of haven . If u go beijing and like mesume then visit it
"WOW!!! A fantastic place, giving an insight into the days of the Emperors. I would recommend China as a holiday destination for everyone to have on their bucket list. Absolutely amazing."
"I don't want to be misunderstood - obviously this is one of the global heritage masterpieces, yet I would like here to describe my impressions based on my visit and a way the Forbidden City is presented to an average visitor. I can't just praise the meaning and the value of this complex - in that sense it is certainly unique and remarkable.
However, this whole thing is very much different from a regular visit perspective. First of all - it's enormous, yet you don't really need so much time for visiting since the most of it - one palace after another - is pretty much the same, and palaces' interiors are mainly closed and visible only from doors or through closed windows; that's my first objection - you can't get any authentic insight into the lives of emperors and courtiers. So you can just look and analyse beautiful exteriors with so many precious details and minimal artworks, yet after a while, that looks again all the same to our eyes as they're representing deeper order and meaning based on Chinese tradition and religion.
Secondly, it's horrible how many people is allowed to be inside at once! It is huge, that's true, but the crowd is even bigger, and you can't enjoy, search or explore the City on your own - it's virtually impossible!
The only thing which is really different and totally recommendable is the garden at its very end. But the garden is the smallest part so it's even more crowded than previous, larger parts, but it's arranged in a completely different way so you could somehow find your own private spot their. Also, it is finally allowed to enter to (only) some of its numerous pavilions (unlike any of the previous, much larger palaces), which is giving a full impression and better understanding of the concept.
Also, my virtual, automatic guide didn't work well so I've got accurate and relevant information only at few out of twenty marked locations. And to go back and ask for a replacement - that would be silly in this area and under such a pressure of people.
Although probably many of us have some special feelings and memories about the Forbidden City from Bertolucci's movie, I must be honest and say that some things are sometimes better in our memory than in its own very presence. You would not learn anything about Pu Yi that you didn't get from the movie."
"The Forbidden City (The Palace Museum) is an amazing experience stepping back in time to the Ming Dynasty and the 24 Emperors that once lived their. This is not the original palace built between 1406 and 1420. It was burnt down, sacked and renovated countless times so the architecture seen today only dates back to the 1700's and onwards, however its still a very impressive place.
The sheer size of the palace is in its self spectacular a city behind the walls.
The many building and temples are too many to describe, the design and decor are very interesting and our guide was able to show and explain the buildings without the information overload.
As with ALL places you visit no matter where and what you are seeing even the Chinese people are not exempt cigarette lighters are a no go, not sure why but its throughout China.
Visiting the Forbidden city is a must see attraction when visiting Beijing."
"The palace is vast and sprawling and a very well preserved historic monument. You are free to wander through a series of courtyards but there is no internal access to the main display buildings which need to be viewed from barriers across the entrances. We found the place a little disappointing in that the courtyards are all pretty much the same and there is a sense of repetition in terms of both the architecture and context as you wander around. It costs 60 Yuan (about £7) to enter, which is pretty good for one of the world's primary historic sites and, notwithstanding the crowds of visitors, the queues for tickets were relatively light when we were there."
Hard to believe that such a spectacular place was built to house the emperor. No wonder visitors were over-awed when turning up here.
"They say it's the largest palace complex in the world, you can find the perfect classic chines palaces there. Vast, colorful, historic and stylish buildings, all are in a perfect order. There are several museums that are worth the visit, but you can't avoid the crowd. If you have lighters, they will take them at the entry."
"OK, so the third adjective may not apply depending on what time of year you go, but it was a scorcher when we were there.

First of all, this is a must see for any first time visitor to Beijing. Think “Empire of the Sun“ or “Mulan”(but not animated), and you will start to get an idea of the size, magnificence, and grandeur of this city. And it is indeed a city, rather than just a palace, so expect to walk a lot.

But if you do go, and you haven’t read the guide the books telling you what to do and what not to do, here are a couple of helpful hints that we wish we would have known:

1. Make sure to take your passport. This goes for Tiananmen Square as well, as you cannot access any of these areas without your passport.

2. If you would like a guided tour, make sure you don’t get one from any of the people that approach you before you get to the ticket window. They will say that they are going to buy your tickets and give you the tour for a certain price, and that price is often double what you will pay if you just walk up to the window and pay for your tickets there. You can also pay for a walking tour (headphones) or get a guided tour directly from the window, and it will be much cheaper. you can also expect that they will try to take you to a Tea House or an expensive restaurant or anywhere else where they can get a cut of the profits when they are done. I don’t know whether the sanctioned tour guides will try this as well, but our unsanctioned tour guide definitely tried.

3. If you are planning to see Tiananmen Square and Forbidden City in the same trip, make sure you start with Tiananmen Square. The Forbidden City trip generally takes you through the city and you exit on the other side. So getting back to Tiananmen Square after you’ve been through the Forbidden City is a long and impractical trip.

But otherwise, this attraction should definitely be on your agenda for a Beijing trip."
"The palace is huge as the name suggests, it is in fact a 'city'. The buildings are beautiful and the compound is vast. Took me 5 hours just to cover the main buildings.There are eateries in the compound so you can have your lunch there. You need identification just to purchase the tickets. Locals are encouraged to buy them online. There are counters on the right side of the main entrance catering to tourists buying tickets on site. It is Y60 per person. You can only enter via the south gate and exit through the north gate and not the other way round. Once exit through the north gate you'll see Jinshan Park opposite. Pay Y2 to enter the park and climb to the top pavilion to get a panoramic view of the Forbidden City. It's worth it."
Would recommend comfortable footwear if visiting. It is spread over a very large area and there are many sections leading off the main thoroughfare. I didn’t find the signage particularly helpful especially when trying to find the exit. They were not clear enough. There are souvenir shops inside and there were places to stop to buy ice cream at a reasonable price. Not my favourite visitor attraction.
"I was marvelled at the sight of so much beauty. There is a lot of walking, but it is worthwhile. They also have beautiful souvenirs."
The Forbidden City is a must see site in Beijing. We only had less than two hours in the late afternoon but it was still a worthwhile visit. The side palaces are just as interesting as the many main palaces. Renting an audio guide for RMB 40 is recommended.
"It is crowded and huge, but very much worthwhile. I would also do a lot of background reading or get an audio tour or both to get a sense of the history of the place and what different buildings were for. The gems and jewelry museum is very impressive. Even if you don't care a thing about the history, it is a nice place to stroll around and find interesting architecture. I found myself just looking at different patterns."
"Be prepared this place is enormous and it’s impossible to see it all on one trip. Take water with you although you can buy inside and a hat if you plan to be there is summer, shade is scarce and popular. I would definitely take the audio guide which starts automatically as you reach certain parts of the complex. It is fascinating and an insight in to ancient Chinese culture. I especially loved the gardens, which took me by surprise in their beauty and intimacy after the vastness of the rest of the complex. Loved it."
"This was our first stop in Beijing. Very big site on a very hot and humid day. Lots of history and it was hard to get close to the buildings window's to see 'inside' the palace. Still, not to be missed."
"We went to the palace early in the morning and did the tiananmen square first.It was a quick walk through since there were too many people already.our guide told us that Chinese visitors all came even earlier to watch the flag raising ceremony which is something spiritual among Chinese nationals.our guide claimed the tickets to the palace museum as it was reserved in advance which saved us lots of time.we did watche the movie Last Emperor before we went to China,this helped a lot in understanding the culture.our children enjoyed it so much and this is certainly an inspring trip for them though this was our first time to visit China.the buildings were magnificent,the craftship in the brick carvings and wood works were just exquite.our guide was great explaining to us the meaning of those detailed works and sharing with us the stories about this palace.It was a very hot day,hardly you could get in the shade,really a lot of people.the time we ended out tour of the palace was about 13:00.almost whole morning was spent there,but worthwhile.
Make sure you wear comfortable shoes and take sun lotion.that is important."
"While it's impressive, it's not well explained which for me takes away from the awesomeness. You do have the option to get a headphone tour (and guided tour) we didn't have the time (only spent three hours here). Still it's worth the ticket price. Just leave yourself time to tour it."
"This is a very interesting experience because there is nothing else like it and a visit evokes thoughts of an enclosed and secret world of intrigue and age old customs. Overall, however I found it a bit disappointing. Personally I enjoy visiting palaces and large historical houses but they are much more engaging if you can see beautiful decorated interiors with furnishings in place as this enables you to gain a greater appreciation of what it would have been like to live there. Unfortunately, this is not the case here as for the most part you are just viewing the outside of buildings and occasionally peering through a narrow gap at some interiors. The place was jammed full of Chinese residents and tourists and it was hard to take any unobstructed pictures. It was worth going in to see the complex and the outsides of the buildings were certainly impressive but it could have been a lot better."
What an experience it must have been for the first Chinese to enter the Forbidden City. This is huge with nearly 9000 buildings overlooking Tian’anmen Square. Beautiful buildings with impressive squares and courtyard gardens. I was a bit disappointed we couldn’t get into any but one or two buildings for which you had to pay extra. Plenty of gift & coffee shops.
There are many attractions close(ish) to each other so this can be included with more interesting sightseg. Tiananmen Square
"We are supposed to visit the place on Friday instead of Saturday, thus very crowded on the visit day. Spend around 5 to 6 hours there with the rental audio guide that cost RMB 20 for mandarin and RMB 40 for English.
The audio guides not in good condition and always unable to detect compare to the audio guides at The temple of heaven.
We brought our own beverages and snacks and enjoy our meal there in between as soon as we found a place to sit."
"We visited on a hot day, lots of people but we could still move around easily. Take water, hats and sunscreen as there is hardly any shade inside the walls. There are little stalls to buy drinks & icy poles from.
This is an amazing place almost 10,000 rooms, something I still find hard to imagine even after being here.
There are no buildings you can actually go into, but you can see through the doorways, this takes a bit of patience and jostling.
Well worth a visit, watch the movie The Last Emperor before you go."
Need to go during weekday and expect lots and lots of people... but need to visit once in a lifetime
"It was 37 degrees, when we went I buy a ticket there was lots of shouting going on in Chinese by attendants, but then it seems the Chinese like to shout a lot. It had lots of people there and my main dislike was you didn’t actually get to go inside the building but just look in the doors. Worth s look for sure. I find it strange how few non Chinese are at these places. Prepare to be stared at."
"The entrance numbers are ""limited"" to 80 000 people per day - which alone should tell you about the experience you will have here.
If you don't mind being jostled all day by crowds of people then pay it a visit. Its a cool attraction, but not worth the hype. I preferred the Summer Palace. At least there are some trees there for shade in the heat and it isn't as crowded."
"Beijing, being the last and current capital city of China, this is the site of the last two dynasties (Ming and Ching). The grounds of this imperial fortress is not for the faint of heart with 9,999 rooms. You can appreciate the culmination of all the best in tour-de-force craftsmanship, architecture, and engineering in the construction of this amazing palace as compared to the Daming Imperial Palace of the Tang Dynasty in Xian and Ming Imperial Palace in Nanjing - both destroyed and in ruins). But the symmetrical layout are very similar. There are less to see nowadays as more exhibits are fenced off to the public. Last time, I was able to enter the chamber where the Emperor sat but now you can only view from the outside. Nevertheless, it's still a must-see."
We had a private tour on a very hot day. We suggest getting the frozen bottles of water at the front entrance and rear exit to save you from heat stroke. The site is well organized and we were lead by our guide through each gate/plaza touched all the highlights.
"This place is a must to visit when you're in Beijing. There were a lot , I mean a lot of people and very hot, so make sure have plenty of water and a good walking pair of shoes. Our tour guide did everything for us, so I don't know how much the tickets cost or what it requires. I don't know if you can tour yourself or not, but we were glad that we booked with the private tour guide."
"One of the most culturally amazing places on earth.
Tiananmen Square opens to the massive complex, 99 temples and 10,000 rooms. Yeah, it’s huge.

Definitely on the must-see for anyone going to China."
I hadn't done a lot of research on this before my visit but the first thing that strikes you is how large it is . The place is massive and you need to allow plenty of time to do it properly. It was quite a hot day on our visit so plenty of liquids and shade required. The main buildings and the courtyards are very impressive and when walking through fell as though they will never end . In its day it must have been something else . Imagine coming from another country on a visit and seeing this place. Probably housed a couple of thousand people and its impressive how it has survived all these years. A must see .
"It’s a must see (and if you watch the movie The Last Emporer before your visit it would be helpful). Massive complex and tons of people. Bring your passport to get tickets. The size/scope is overwhelming and this is a one way in, one way out design so you have to walk end to end. My suggestion would be to move quickly through and don’t miss some side entrances which take you through museums (easy to miss). Our guide obviously loves this place and wanted us to see it all. We got about 1/3 of the way through and realized there’s just so much that started to look the same that we just wanted to get to the exit. Once you get there, you’re way always from where you entered so our guides car was a long ways so he takes a city bus back. Long wait for the bus and crowded... had to wait for about 3 busses to come and go before there was one with room. I would suggest a taxi at that point. Our guide was opposed as he said the taxis sitting there take advantage and overprice. I’d have paid. Overall, taxi’s are cheap in China."
The Forbidden City is huge and extremely popular - try and see it either first or last thing to avoid the crowds. Beautiful buildings and very well preserved and although very easy to navigate I feel you'd get more from the experience with a guide. Easy to spend a few hours here and be sure to cross the road and visit the lookout (cost 2RMB and a few flights of stairs) - most impressive view of the city.
"The Forbidden City is huge! It’s a must see when in Beijing, but be prepared for big crowds, lotsss of tourists and lots of children squatting to urinate everywhere"
It was raining for half of our tour but still easily navigated. What an amazing piece of history. This UNESCO heritage listed site is well worth seeing. We had a guide but honestly the Beijing metro is so easy to navigate just get the train to Tiananmen Square and you can walk from there. I would allow a couple of hours to explore the square and the Forbidden City. Take good walking shoes as the ground can be uneven and slippery if raining.well worth it and highly recommend it to have a look.
"It’s part of Chinese history (and see a movie or two about Chinese emperors beforehand- documentaries or fiction). It’s massive. There’s a ton of walking so just be ready.

Facilities inside are nice. There are a few places to enjoy shade and sit. Restrooms are fine. Near the end is the garden with trees and nice plants (you can read more about why there aren’t trees anywhere else in the compound)."
eye opening experience by looking at the architectures and well preserved ancient buildings within the compound. crowded with tourists all the time
"Such a beautiful palace, we spent 3 hours here but you could spend a whole day here. So much amazing history and incredible architecture. The gardens are also amazing. The only issue are the huge crowds which is expected and everyone pushing to get to the front to see inside certain sections"
"Another tour on our Trip a Deal holiday, and was amazed by the Chinese history in the Forbidden City. Although it is hundreds of years old, it has been well preserved for the people to enjoy for ages to come."
"This is a must see, the sheer size of the place and detail of the buildings is truly amazing. It is great experience to walk around and be told the history."
You are just immersed in an ancient culture. I loved being in a place where so much has occurred. I went as part of an optional tour and I am so glad I did as I was considering going on my own. Just navigating the ticket booth would have taken extra time. This way we were given a wonderful history lesson and shown the best restrooms. Beware of the uneven brink floors. Bing sturdy shoes.
Wear your comfortable shoes because it is big and there is a lot of walking to do. Lots of wonderful ancient buildings to see. My favourite part was the garden with its sculptures.
After seeing the movie the last emperor which was filmed in the Forbidden City and to be and see for myself was a great expefience
A Really cool place to visit as its a huge part of chinese culture and its history. Beautiful buildings. Can be crowded but its worth a look and you can get some great photos..
"Loved this visit - the site is extremely popular and therefore crowded. It is practically impossible to view the emperors rooms due to the rush. Overall, it is well managed but there are things that could be improved to provide a better overall experience."
"Impressive place to visit to have a glimpse of the palace.
be there the moment it open to ensure you manage to cover as much as you can.
a lot of walking and stop to read.
a very comfy walking shoe needed.
one can spend whole day by visiting every room available."
"It’s a great place to visit to learn about the history and culture of China.
The place is very crowded but it is well managed."
"This place is huge, a fairly large city. This is an architectual treasure. The whole place takes a few hours to go through them. Some areas of the Western Palaces are closed for restoration work. I visited in the afternoon from 1:30 to 4:30 and I did not see everything, so a 2nd visit is in order.

Entry is CNY 60 (USD $9.90). The entry has also gone cashless for Chinese Citizens. Foreigners can purchase an entry at the Guest Services Building to the East of the Main Entrance. Initial Security Checks are done approaching on the sidewalk going from both Tian' Anmen subway stations (East and West) on Line 1. You must have ID to go through the security channel (foreigners should have your passport with you). Once you go through the park entrance (going through the building with Chairman Mao's portrait on in, you will go straing for a good distance to pay your entrance to the Palace Museum. The place is also ticketless so your passport becomes your ticket as you are verified when you go through the turnstyle into the Museum."
"Forbidden City is huge. According to the tour guide it is 72 hectares and they limit the number of people that come in daily to 80,000. Unlike the Summer Palace which doesn’t limit the number of entrants, FC has wide open spaces so crowds are not too suffocating. It is suffocating when falling in line for tickets or going to the toilets (more on this below) or through security. Historical attraction. They have audio guides for CNY40.00 but I did not use one. Many halls, “palaces”, lots of buildings each with its own meaning. I want to warn you ladies. The toilets in the Beijing attractions such as this, the Wall, Summer Palace are completely disgusting. Foul, foul odors and they are squat toilets except the handicap one. Have strong legs lest you fall into those germ infested toilets. I came well prepared because I anticipated this. I brought: Kleenex, Clorox wipes, hand anti bacterial, and those small body wash tubes they give at hotels so you can wash your hands. Bring anti viral masks if you are bothered by thick crowds. Go very early because the crowds thicken as the morning goes on. Come prepared and you’ll have fun."
"Wonderful adventure, lots to see and a good insight in to how the Emperors lived
This place is very busy and I would certainly recommend a guide as for me our Guide made this trip worth while , in respect to he was very knowledgeable and spoke excellent English"
"We took the subway to Line-1 Tiananmen East station, exit B. We were on the same side of the street as the Tiananmen Gate (Gate of Heavenly Peace) where the portrait of President Mao can be seen here. We went through the Tiananmen Gate and Duan Men (Upright Gate). Please get ready with your passport along with the entrance ticket vouchers. The passport number was keyed into the system by the staff to ensure we had valid tickets. Then, we entered the Meridian Gate/Wu Men (South Gate) and started our journey to explore the Forbidden City/Palace Museum. There are signage to indicate the various area in the Palace. The usual central axis route starts from Wu Men-Hall of Supreme Harmony-Palace of Heavenly Purity-Imperial Garden-Shen Wu Men. In order to leave the Palace, the exit is through the Gate of Divine Prowess/Shen Wu Men (North Gate), or East Gate which leads to Donghuamen Dajie.

From the Shen Wu Men/North Gate, one can proceed to Jingshan Park to have a panoramic view of Forbidden City at the highest lookout point, WanChun Pavilion. No subway stations at the North Gate of Palace Museum and South Gate of Jingshan Park. South Gate of Jingshan Park is the entrance to the Park where we need to purchase the entrance ticket with a fee of RMB2. Avoid taxi. There are sight-seeing and normal buses to go to other areas. We took a normal bus no.103 to Wangfujing at the bus stops located outside of the North Gate of the Palace. Please queue according to the bus number as indicated on the floor. Sight-seeing bus no.1 and no. 2 to the Palace Museum ticket office located at the South Gate, Tiananmen Square and Qianmen/Front Gate; Bus no.101 to Beihai Park; Bus no. 103 to Beihai Park, Wangfuiing, Beijing Zoo and Beijing Railway Station; Bus no.109 to Beijing West Railway Station and Beihai Park; Bus no.124 to Shichahai and Gong Wang Fu/Prince Gong’s Mansion. The usual bus fare is RMB3 within the designated zone. From Shen Wu Men/North Gate of the Palace to Wangfujing, the bus fare was RMB1 per person since it was a short distance of journey."
"This forbidden city is amazing. I was there on the weekend, it was crowded by tons of people. But, the que was easy, we wait not too long to entry.
For the ticket, as I am foreign tourist, I need to buy at the counter, and very easy. I got discount qs well. Worth to visit"
I always enjoy the forbidden city. A must go place. If you have not been there then good to get the translator or a guide. Weekends can be crowded as 80k people visit. Best to go weekdays
"An amazing place the forbidden city well maintained with the loads of tourists here only hitch is since you are not allowed to go inside the rooms , it’s too chaotic
The guarding lions are too good"
"Was a nice place to be and tick off the bucket list, but I felt they could have done a bit more out of it. You are to far away to have a proper close look inside the buildings and openings to small and rowed to look inside.
Been there done that, thats all."
"Great place to visit, so much history. Its a shame you can only look inside rooms from a distance, but I suppose you have to have that security"
"A Castle is a Castle is a Castle, but...seeing how the Chinese did so beginning in the 1400's was a different experience altogether. We were there during the dragon boat festival so the place was shoulder to shoulder. If you are claustrophobic. choose a different day."
One of the most breathtaking places I’ve ever visited. The sheer size is amazing. Spent five hours wandering around and would definitely visit again.
"Was one of the rare places in Beijing where you see traditional architecture, which I absolutely loved, but my joy was marred partly by the weather and the number of visitors (could be better on weekdays, I went on a Saturday). Also, watch out for scammers of all sorts!"
"My second trip to the Forbidden City was no less memorable than my first. We started the morning at the flag raising outside Tiananmen Square, then made our way to the Forbidden City. Five hours later, we had covered the perimeter of the sprawling complex, had dipped into some of the less considered exhibitions, and even spend an amazing 20 minutes strapped into a VR chair, looking at the Forbidden City through the eyes of people who were there hundreds of years ago. The Forbidden City never disappoints"
"This place felt like a time capsule, and we loved that. Just making your way there is an event on its own. So much history and the architecture eye candy really. It just goes on and on. So get there early. They do close early sometimes. The tickets are so affordable. Really worth the visit and the flower gardens will leave you breathless."
"Get your ticket online and take your passport and go to the south gate for entry
This is a must see and it takes three hours
Do not plan on transportation at the north gate exit as you will be ripped off,walk away to the east then you can get transport"
"I've always wanted to stand in the middle of Tiananmen Square and take in the significance of its history, particularly the uprising in 1989. It's impressive and was crowded and has some new digital screens that had been installed. I remember standing in the crowded square in November 2012 a couple of days before the Chinese National Congress was to elect the new politburo in the building to one side of the square...and all of a sudden troops came in and cleared the entire square of people in under 10 minutes."
Yes I liked this visit the city is huge but not a lot to see except the buildings and gardens you can’t go into any building but it’s still worth a visit as we stayed near the square we walked to the forbidden city and bought tickets there. If you want to see sight no need for a tour but if you want to get the history a tour is probably recommended with a guide that speaks English. If you visit Mao’s tomb no bags allowed even bum bags you have to give them in first across road and lots of security around. Recommen going early in morning I think it opens at 7.00 am
"First visit was in 2007 and second visit was in May 2018. I must say This Heritage is well maintain. And will keep coming to see the beautiful building in unique architecture. Thousand of visitors visit this place everyday and it is save and paperless as they use good system with your ID or passport to record as an entrance fee when you register to purchase tickets at entrance. Just scan your ID or passport and pay then use your passport at the entrance to check if you have registered or purchased a ticket.
this system needs to be implemented in other countries to save the planet and paperless.

Bravo China👍👍👍"
"We were so lucky with the queues.
Got there at 11:30am on Saturday. Did first passport check, then a second, then lined up for tickets and audio guide. Then another security check. We were in. Audio guide works on gps depending on which was you choose to go. It’s massive. We spent a good three hours here but you could’ve done more. We then got the bus to Tiananmen Square after. Easily accessible from opposite end to entry.
I recommend you take water and .. you must take passport!"
"I went there early in the morning just before they opened. Since it was a Saturday, there were so many people.

The palace was so big. It was very gorgeous too. You can imagine the situation when all the officers went to see the king for the meeting.

There are postings in front of all major buildings to that you know what was its function.

It is a must go place."
The Forbidden City is such an interesting place so rich with history. Beautiful buildings. We especially loved the palace garden. Very crowded of course. A must see.
This is definitely a must see in Beijing. It's impossible to comprehend how large it is until you're inside. It feels like it just keeps going. We were on a tour and I would highly recommend doing a full tour as there's so much to see.
"Was very interesting walking through the different buildings and courtyards, I highly recommend having a guide to get the most out of it though - otherwise its just buildings."
"We couldn't believe how large the gates, buildings, and the surrounding complex was. Standing inside you could really appreciate that the Forbidden City would be built for an emperor. Most of the complex was restored with beautiful detail. This was the main reason for visiting Beijing and it was spectacular."
"Yes it is magnificent and huge however we went on a wet day on a Sunday....OMG
Felt like a wet sheep surrounded by tens of thousands of rude wet sheep.
Yes it is a must do, and our bespoke tour was excellent however we just couldn’t see inside anywhere due to the hoards.
A challenging day, even though we got there early!"
Went as part of an Urban Adventure day tour - interesting but you don't get to see much really - fortunately our guide had a lot of info
Massive places & precious pieces from the Ming/Qing dynasties; Need to spend at least half day in moderate walking pace; Very crowded; Better to join a tour for better understanding of Chinese history
China was a disappointment for me. All of these places although magnificent for their time are now just tourist attractions that tell a story that really is not that great.
"As expected that need about 3-4 hour at least to visit this place.

The arrangement is good accept the transport after the visit like only a bus available in that area and very crowded"
"Amazing site, obviously on anyone’s to do list when visiting Beijing for the first time. It gets very busy but is very much worth the trip. Lots of gift shops within selling all sorts of souvenirs to suit anyone’s prices low or high."
"As many others have commented, this place is absolutely enormous. Just the size and scope of it alone is fascinating, let alone the history and the architecture.

My wife and I would’ve been fine with the audio tour. Sometimes we find the audio tours to go on a bit much for her taste, but I can still be fine.

However, we were traveling with two teenage children and we knew that they would have very little patience for that. So we hired a guide to take us here along with a couple of other places over two days. We are so glad that we did. She took us to some of the parts we thought would be the most interesting and give us a good background and history.

This is one of the absolute must sees when you were in Beijing."
"I booked a private tour with my hotel (Shangri La Beijing), my tour guide was great and she spoke great English. It was about a 20 min or less car ride with traffic. Her knowledge was perfect and made the tour better. It is busy of course, but it was a great day with a cool breeze. People aren't used to seeing foreigners so I was asked to take lots of pictures, which didn't bother me. You can't go inside of any of the buildings, but can take pics outside if you wait for the crowd to move. Recommend going here is you like history."
The Forbidden City is a must see. It is rich in Chinese culture and very eductional. We really enjoyed our visit there. Be prepared to walk a great deal on uneven surfaces and the public bathrooms leave much to be desired. The bathrooms are a real culture shock so plan ahead.
"There's not much I can add beyond what's already posted but a couple tips:

- For foreigners, the ticket office is to the right just before the entrance. BRING YOUR PASSPORT
- It can get hot and sunny! I wish I brought an umbrella
- It wasn't that crowded on a Weds in June (started at 8:30am)
- You walk a lot! I logged almost 10 miles
- I didn't use a tour guide or the audio recording but still got a lot out of it - it was just amazing to walk around and think of all the history.
- You can only enter in the South gate but exit from the East or North gate.
- The gardens near the North gate are nice and shady
- There's air conditioning in the indoor exhibits - worth hanging out just to cool down"
"The Forbidden City is one of the best preserved museums in the world, full of interesting history and architecture that will leave you gaping at the opulence and immensity invested in it. Best to go with a private tour guide from Viators as they are equipped to tell you more about palace history and intrigues which are usually missing from guide books. There are eateries within the city itself so you wouldn’t have to leave the city for lunch. We walked for 7 hours with a 45 min break for lunch and still couldnt cover the entire city. Exhausting but fun!"
A lot of empty spaces. Maybe a little period furniture would help the experience. As the place is quite large a few extra seats would help those with limited mobility.
This is a place that you obviously have to go to if you are going to visit Beijing. I remember learning all about the Forbidden City back in my high school history class and it was so cool to have all of that come to life as I experienced this beautiful and fascinating location for myself.
"This is a must see if you are in the downtown area. We walked to this location from our hotel.
The entrance is a little hard to find. We originally walked to what we thought was an entrance to find out it was the exit and had to walk probably a mile to get to the entrance. Foreigners pay at a ticket window at which time you are asked for your passport. Your passport number is entered in the ticket information, so it is more than a formality.
The complex is very large so expect a lot of walking.
There are areas than you can rest as well as vendors selling drinks etc."
We enjoyed our visit to the Forbidden City. There is a lot of walking but one is able to hire men who will provide mobility assistance.
"If you want to see the same thing over and over again, go here. Literally after the first 3 buildings it all begins to look the same but with a different purpose. And it is super-crowded."
"it's definitely interesting to see, was very crowded when we were there in mid of may, didn't expect it to be that huge!"
This is part of Beijing's history and can easily be done in conjunction with Tiananmen Square. A guide is well worth the investment. So much info to take in.
"I gave it 5 star as gong midweek early seemed to have a reasonable amount of crowds and was pleasant. I was really struck of how large this complex is, along with the smaller museums and such. Was able t buy my ticket at the foreigners window and go right in. I took my time and explored the place well. I could see that the crowds were begiing to build as the day went on. I exited the north gate and went to the park ahead to get a full view of the Forbidden city afterward.
I walked by on Saturday and the place was completely different. Lines were huge! If I had seen that, I probably would have skipped it altogether. So, my advice is go midweek early if you can."
The way they've set up the area for viewing really creates an immersive feeling as you walk through the grounds. You can almost imagine the people thousands of years ago living there. It's a lot of walking to get into the palace let alone once you're inside. Wear good shoes!
"Great place! from the enter you will feel the how powerful empire was!
entering fee is about 30ұ, but for king palace which is above other palaces you will need to get another fee."
This place is very very hot. Plenty of walking. A very imposing city but gives sad vibe. You need a whole day to really explore most of the place. I couldn't wait to move away because of the heat.
"Wow this place is huge! They do offer a student discount which cuts the price to 1/3! If you are really interested, you can spend an entire day here but if you are just looking at the architecture it could probably be a few hours!"
"The Forbidden City is an amazing palace complex to visit. Although much of it is still not renovated, it appears there is progress being made in that regard. Nevertheless, it is so interesting to learn about the dynasties and how the royals lived. I think it would be best to have a guide as you walk through the complex. It would be hard to get a full story without a knowledgeable guide, and given the size of this place, you might get lost without someone who can help you. It is well worth the effort to walk through this sight. (We walked from Tianamen Square through the Forbidden City, and it was about 15,000 steps."
"Visited as part of a tour
Absolutely wonderful to visit a place of such importance In the history of China
Exquisite"
Visited on a tour with a guide. It was good to have his knowledge. It was also good to be in a group as I am sure we would have got lost otherwise. You seem to keep going through temples and coming out into huge cement areas. The history is interesting and I am so glad we visited. It was a very hot day but there was refreshments available. Toilets were 4 star.
"Again another place I have been to many times. It's very pretty but it is 90% just courtyards, it's hard to see the various things inside the buildings in the center both because of limited visibility and the sheer volume of people.The marble work and general ingenuity are fantastic to admire but overall it's not something I think you should prioritize over other things to do in Beijing."
"I was shocked by the sheer size and beauty of this place! Definitely book a tour so that you can learn about this deeply historical place, ideally a skip the line one!"
"Great to see this place, was huge with some wonderful buildings. Wee shop at end & throughout sell food & souvenirs, lovely to visit"
You have to book in advance. Is better through internet. No smoking. Entrance control. Buy water before you get in. You need hours
"The Forbidden City is a huge palace complex. You will need at least half a day to see it. It is incredibly crowded (somebody told me there are 80.000 visitors a day...). Leave the main crowded routes through the middle and turn left or right. Amazingly almost no one leaves the „main route“, so you might get pictures without any people if you go there...
Important: there is no ticket sale at this sight. You have to order your admission ticket online before you visit! Therefore you will need your passport number. Your passport will be your admission ticket so you need to bring it with you because they will type your passport number into the system to see if you have bought a ticket."
Such a beautiful area! Lots of things to do and see. Photo ops are amazing! Enjoy the natural history and beauty
"An enormous complex, comprising some 900 elegant buildings, sublime courtyards and gardens, and exquisite statues and other remarkable artefacts, all surrounded by a 32-foot wall and a wide deep moat.

Take advice on timing of visit, as the venue can be massively crowded. Our local guide proved excellent in this respect."
"Second visit here, and would gladly return next time Beijing! You could very easily take a full day to amble through here and still want to return. Nex day see what you have shed on your first visit!"
As i said all the above a tour guide a must have plenty of water good shoes before you leave you can dress up in costumes have photos taken great experience
"When I went to visit Gugong 18 years ago as a student, our experience was enlightening and educational. I even felt a sense of pride (I am 6th generation overseas Chinese) as I walked through the expansive grounds of hall after exquisitely decorated hall.

This time around, I wanted to show our children the largest Palace in the world, and was greatly disappointed. We went in the morning around 9am, and already we were greeted by lines-- HOARDS-- of tourists waiting their turn at the security checks to get into the Palace Museum. We began our slow trek to the Meridian Gate, going along with the flow.

We went past the gate and THERE WERE NO SIGNS where tourists were supposed to buy entrance tickets. Plus we had to endure the crowd yet again and try to decipher the procedure. So we got to the counter and showed our passports, and went inside the museum. MORRREEEE people were there. Instead of enjoying and learning about Chinese history, we were stressed out by the HOARDS of tourists.

I don't think my kids will want to come here again."
"A must if staying in Beijing for longer than a day. It can be crowded, strongly recommend going with a tour. Seeing the imperial garden takes your breath away!"
"This is area is vast and requires lots of walking! Recommend you go from South to North! Many duplications of what to see! You can see the emperor’s and empress’s quarters and the throne! Remember this is a very large area to tour! On the north end is a large garden! As you exit the north you can climb the hill to a temple and take pictures of the entire Forbidden Temple,"
"forbidden city is nothing you have imagine
i felt like i was in the backstage of hollywood movies....hehe
so well maintained everything, so well protected from time and people
one tip; lighters/matches are not allowed because all is made of wood....."
"Our tour of the Forbidden City was incredible. We entered the main gates and joined thousands of other visitors to the former home of the Chinese emperors. Each area of the City was more magnificent than the last. Each had four buildings including a massive temple, two side buildings that were storehouses, and a living building. We passed through what seemed to be 20+ such areas visiting at least 90 different buildings.

After spending several hours, we headed out and reflected at the magnitude of what we had witnessed. The City was home to two different dynasties and their associated emperors spanning more than 600 years of reign.

Absolute must see."
Beautiful palace complex! I love the sacred ordinance of each stages of the buildings! here in forbidden city you'll find some very fascinating stories!! Please don't come mid day! It was so busy we felt like we were in a stream of ants crawling to work at snail pace under merciless sun.
"Great experience except was in a heat wave 36C. Know that you can only enter and exit at certain points and they are WAY far apart. Taxis CANNOT drop you out front at the only entrance, and they want to charge 4xs the rate to take you back to your hotel at the exit -- had to haggle.

buildings where fantastic , but thought they would have artifacts to look at ,,,, like a museum...wrong except for the clock and watches and the treasury, they are empty buildings that you can't go in."
"Remember to book your ticket online !!
Which I will do day after .

No gate ticket purchases. Being a solo traveler . I was approached by a lady to go for coffee or drinks. Something I was told to be careful about . Beware of scammers !! I told her no and took off."
"should visit this place, has lots of history and things to see. does get very busy during the summer."
You can't go to Beijing and not see the Forbidden City. We were lucky enough to get a guided tour - and the place was a madhouse - but I'm glad we went. This is where the emperors lived for eons. Mere mortals were seldom allowed within the palace walls. It's wonderfully preserved and full of bling.
This place is really huge. Lots of history and knowledge to soak in. Architecture is amazing.You better wearing comfortable shoes.
"Adjacent to Tianamen Square, this is also a 'must do' while in Beijing. There are actually quite a few english signs in this area, so worth walking around and absorbing the culture and this history. Very impressive for something over 600 years old!"
This is of course a Place you must visit. But not on Mondays since I Think it´s closed. I Think you need at least 2-3 hours for the visit.
"This is a beautiful site steeped in history. It would be worth taking a tour to fully appreciate the history.

When you arrive at Tiananmen, you will be required to go through security scanners and may be asked to show your passport. Security is tight throughout Tiananmen, with police and military personal clearly visible throughout the area.

The subway station is a short walk away from the entrance. Visit early as the site is always crowded and closes around 3pm. Be prepared for locals to stare at you with curiosity and occasionally come up to you to take photos of/with you. The locals don't appear to be used to seeing foreigners so they are often very interested."
"We were lucky to be foreign tourists, the queue at the ticket office is a lot shorter than the chaotic madness at the square counters for the locals. To get the best from this tour, it's ideal to visit as a small group and pay for a local guide to explain the many intricacies of daily rituals, imperial customs and how the courtesans lived. We were doubly lucky to not only find the palace scribe present at the Museum shop (we were told he is rarely there) but he was also available to show us his poetic prowess and artistry in calligraphy. We were surrounded by a huge crowd by the time he finished his commission work for us. What a privilege to have enjoyed this visit!"
"Halls and buildings, garden areas, gates, restored halls and buildings, ones undergoing restoration.... With over 900 of these, there is so much to see and absorb. Audio guides help, but sometimes it is good just to wander around and marvel at the colors and designs and imagine the lives of the emperors and their households who worked and played here. Emperors in different dynasties used halls for different purposes and it is all too much to absorb in a morning or afternoon. A few hours later we weren't sure who did what when, but the rich colors, ornate carvings and symbolism of roof adornments were remembered long after the visit."
"Okay if it is your first trip to Asia. But nothing to do with the beautiful city you see in the movies. The huge complex has been completely stripped of its decoration, furniture and other human touch. Only remains empty walls and few cheap pieces at places. Sadly, nothing has been done to restore its beauty after the revolutionary carnage. The size of the place and its history are the only impressive things. The museum is not to the place ‘s standard. The garden is the only piece of greenery and human touch you can see. And of course, you are surrounded by regiments of agitated tourists with megaphone and threatening selfie sticks. Come early anyway. I had more fun taking a ride in the nearby old district with one of the motorcycles waiting at the Forbidden City entrances."
"The Forbidden City, or Gugong, is a 9,000 room maze of courtyards, palaces, and ceremonial halls. Twenty-four emperors ""The Sons of Heaven"" and two dynasties surged the Middle Kingdom. It is protected by 30 foot walls and a 160 foot wide moat. The Forbidden City was a pace where commoners were kept out of for nearly 500 years. The greatest architectural triumph was completed in a mere 14 yeas by 200,000 workers. Behind its Gate of Supreme Harmony, which is flanked by Bronze Lions, you will find classical buildings with interiors featuring marble floors, and ceilings with grand murals. It is a place you must visit. Be aware that it is extremely crowded and you should get your ticket in advance."
"The palace museum (which, in effect, is the forbidden city) is THE sight in Beijing (if not in China in total). The size of the complex is overwhelming, so plan a lot of time. Without an audioguide, explanations are quite scarce, but still the old 1500-1700c buildings are an impressive sight. Especially in contrast to the socialist modernism of Tiananmen Square."
So much better understanding of the story by reading Twilight in the Forbidden City by Reginald Fleming Johnston. This books was used as a source for most of the movie The Last Emperor which you should watch before coming to Beijing! With the knowledge of the history of the end of the Qing Dynasty my visit had much more meaning.
"IT shows a peek into history with the lives of the emperors in full display. But, apparently, the wife had to choose the concubines for the emperor. Not good, eh?"
"It is almost impossible to decribe the extent of what the Forbidden City holds for the traveller to take in !! From it's beautifully restored ares and the ongoing maintenence of the courtyard paving to the absolute size of the area and the buildings it contains, it is just something you have to see to appreciate. And to walk from one end to the other is mindblowing !! We loved the Terracotta Warriors and this would certainly be our next most favorite thing to see and experience in China !! When you think of ancient chinese archtecture, this is what it's all about !!"
"The forbidden city is one of Beijing top historical attraction which should not be missed.
Allow minimum 2-3 hours for the visit .
Come before 3.30 PM as you will not get tickets after 3.50.
Extremely busy attraction and the number of visitor can be overwhelming so try not to visit during holidays or weekends.

Rent the electronic guide to better understand the area, this is much better way to enjoy the experience then having a guided tour."
It's hard to get you head around how large this a complex is but it seems to go on forever. The architecture is amazing and the roofs are placed on leggo like interconnecting blocks without the use of nails. As you move from complex to complex you're treated from one wonder to another.
"Feel lucky to be here.
Pros
History
Awesome sights

Cons
People
People
A lot of people.

Tip. Don't go mid day. You'll be a slow roast pork! Dense Crowd move in slow stream which resulted you being fry alive by the scorching sun."
"This was such an amazing interesting place constructed in 1406 to 1420.Consists of 980 buildings over 180 acres,declared world heritage site in 1987"
"Wall to wall crowds. We went in the morning. We heard the crowds are less in the afternoon but we wanted to be sure we made the 80000 cutoff for the day.

The place is huge. Really only one direction to go. You must enter in the south. Eventually you will exit in the north.

The palaces were underwhelming.
You cannot go inside. Looking inside was tough with the crowds. And little to see besides a fancy throne.

On the east side there are some interesting museums that have some ancient weapons. But the signage is ambiguous.

The imperial garden was interesting but not really a garden. Really more of a shaded area."
"Whilst the Forbidden City has an amazing history, that history is not translated in the presentation to the visitor. Very little information is provided with virtually zero context. Visitors are kept away from significant areas and whilst interesting... you’re left wondering.

Some of the display rooms such as those of the Concubines are tired and old, the windows to look through are dirty and smeared and as I said, generally there is a lack of information anywhere.

There’s no way I could recommend this as a compelling destination."
"expected more than just the old buildings and a few bronze pots. workers were there ripping up all the old cobblestones and replacing them with new cast concrete blocks. A lot of the buildings had been renovated, new paint, roofing etc but there was really nothing else there......strange"
Fascinating insight into ancient cultures and the lengths the dynasties went to protect their line of descent
The place is magnificent but so so crowded you feel as if you are being pushed through. We went with a guide which helped but best not to go at the weekend. I felt we missed a lot as we simply couldn’t get to see things properly. You need sharp elbows to endure the place
Nothing can ever prepare one for this place . It is stunning and a must see in life . Only a vast fraction of the site is open to the public but that is vast enough. The stunning treasures that await inside are breathtaking and as it was my second visit it was brilliant to return to
"Ticketing experience was strange - just a tip, you need to have a Chinese phone number in order to buy tickets online (they have QR codes posted all around the entrance to the Forbidden City; scan it and you'll be directed to the website) but you can only complete booking with a local phone number. Otherwise, you'll need to get there early and snag one of their physical tickets, which are sold in limited amounts. You can find that line to the right of the security entrance."
"My wife and I took part in a Gray Line - Beijing Tour of the three sites. Lee was our tour
guide and did a great job in explaining everything and keeping all of us walking very quickly!

Our group had a very nice lunch at an excellent chinese restaurant! We enjoyed everything and would recommend visiting these sites very much!!"
"There is a metro station near by but allow yourself 2/3 hours as the place is huge with gardens, halls and temples. Bring your passport or ID and you can buy tickets in advance. Try to get there early to avoid the groups and crowds and walk through the sides of the temples to enjoy better. When exiting through the other side you can visit the park next door or take a bus to a different location"
"This place is a must visit despite the huge crowds, the history and stories surrounding the Emperors and their lifestyle is so interesting. Crowds aside, you can almost picture what life would have been like within the palace walls and the many buildings housing up to 3000+ concubines etc.."
Went to the Forbidden City as part of Trip A Deal Tour.. Worth a visit - a big complex so a fair amount of walking but not too much for the average person. Just like the film The Last Emperor!
"The Forbidden City is a fascinating place with centuries of history. The Emperor had up to 3000 concubines with most only seeing him twice in their lives but they were locked away in a small private residence and had no contact with anyone except their eunuchs. Such sad lives for beautiful young women.
The grandeur and excess of the life of the emperor is on display as you walk on the paths he walked into the inner circle of the city.
Make it a definite part of your visit to China."
"Seeing the Forbidden City helps but in context the size and life of the occupants. Most of the building have been reconstructed/restored and the buildings are in very good shape. It could have been the tour we were on but I was somewhat disappointed, perhaps expecting to see more artifacts. As at most venues were visited, it was crowded and the experience might have been better with some crowd control."
The Forbidden City is vast and iconic and suitably impressive. But it’s also really crowded. You have to aggressively push your way to each building if you want a peak inside and gaining an even vaguely emptyish photo of the site is never going to happen. I’ve never seen so many people at a tourist attraction before in my life and it was disappointing in that it ruined the charm of the site.
This is a solo trip you can easily make. You need around 4 hours to get the tickets and tour the place freely and peacefully.
This site was fun to see but so big and a lot of walking to see the whole thing. I was expecting to see a big Palace but this place actually took a couple of hours and I don’t think we saw the whole thing. We may have gotten more our of a private tour but we just stopped in and toured around by ourselves.
We were at the Forbidden City as part of a tour and had a few hours here. It was not enough time to explore it all. There are so many buildings and so much history to the area. Be prepared to walk heaps and climb many steps but it is so worth it. The area is so much bigger than I expected.
"I recommened buying tickets online one day in advance or a few hours in advance. I also dont recommend coming in winter as you will spend hours freezing outside.

It's touristy and you can't escape the crowds but it is really worth seeing as it makes you understand puts into perspective how MONUMENTAL everything in China is. You can spend hours here, my favourite part were the gardens."
"The historical facts are so bizarre and amazing that it is a fantastic place to visit and enjoy.
Very colourful, if you are not on a tour, get a guide to show you the highlights."
We went here as part of a group and could not believe how extensive this site is - there were buildings and couriers everywhere you looked. The buildings were impressive even though there was nothing inside to see. Make sure you leave a few hours to explore and have good walking shoes on.
"We were with a guide on a saturday morning...and it was BUSY! He knew how to get us through the right doors to get through the crowds...It seemed to be use the furthest right door where possible at all times! It is fascinating and so full of history. You cannot go into any of the buildings but can still appreciate the magnitude of the area.
Definitely go to this when in Beijing, but go early!"
"While there is very little inside the buildings, the courtyards and buildings themselves are very impressive. Huge area - very busy and lots of walking."
"Cool trip like any tourist trap..I was there in April not a bad according to guide. The weather was good, CHINA is a big country much to do much to see. Definitely a bucket list challenge"
"Rich in history, so guided tour is very useful. A comprehensive tour takes a considerable amount of time."
"What a fantastic place to visit, the culture and history is amazing. Our guide Linda did great job of showing us the history of the areas.
Thank you Linda for a great experience."
"Nice to see forbidden city, best is to come morning time, it is important to have guide, it is rather big, you need 3 hours and lot of walking, inside it looks all similarly, there are no trees only in special garden. It is really nice place to visit, please follow Instagram Mia.Bella.official
For more pictures"
"the architecture is amazing as are the buildings. when you see that it was built without nails, its makes you wonder how they were able to build such quality buildings that would last so long. each courtyard is a splendor to view and as you progress, the buildings become more wonderful. reading some history on the forbidden city will make the visit that much more enjoyable. the fact that it was built in the 1400's just adds to the marvel of this place"
"One of the most beautifull palaces in the world, a trip to the Chinese history, architecture and culture. WONDERFULL..."
Beautiful and incredible. Our guide Venessa from China Highlights took us through site which is huge. It was a great day and full of things to marvel at.
"it may seem just like another tourist attraction, but it has so much to offer. It is a place that you can revisit everytime you are in Beijing."
"The scale of the Forbidden City is huge, with lovely museums within that are optional extras. Go early, in order to be in the queue before it opens. You could walk through in a couple of hours or you could spend the whole day here. I've done both. it has to be the top cultural tourist site in China"
It was like palace in palace in palace in palace...... never ending circles and the new building emerges after every gate. Truly it was forbidden city!
We recently visited the Forbidden City. A good thing to know is that it is closed on Mondays. We were able to come back another day and fit it in several hours before leaving Beijing. We did not have a ticket but was able to go to the ticket office and purchase it. We went first thing in the AM as all the tour groups were getting there and we didn't have to wait. They take your passport and key in your information. You do not get an actual ticket but they look at the your passport and look up your information on the computer at the point where you enter. (Just thought I'd share the procedure since it's different than how it is done in the U.S.) We didn't have a guide and felt we got a very good experience just walking through on our own.
"We purchased our tickets on the day with our passports and it's a cheap and simple process.

Most things have English placards on or near them but to get the most out of your visit, book a guided tour - it'll also help you structure your very long walk through the massive grounds."
"I would recommend to take a certified operator after you get your tickets (you will find them just after the gates, in fact several will approch you :) ).
They will drive you thru the history of the place, providing you insites and small details of the city and Beijin."
Well I was surprised how massive this place was. Our guide from Jacks Tours was amazing and we missed nothing. Not for the poor walker though
It was fascinating seeing all the iconic and historic facts. Very well presented and in well written English.
"We first visited the Forbidden City 20 years ago, and found it to be fabulous. While the buildings & gardens are still gorgeous and the history interesting, a visit is now a bit of a torture test. The first stage is standing in a line to pass through security screening to enter Tiananmen Square, which is now barricaded with fencing. Then another huge crowd when crossing under the huge Mao painting to the entrance of the Forbidden City. You are then accosted by touts wanting to sell you tickets saying that they should have been pre-purchased online (not true for foreigners), or claiming that tickets have been sold out. Finally when you find the actual ticket booth for foreigners, you have to line up there, and finally through another security check. Phew!

Once you are in, you then have to fight crowds to get to the door of each building to peer in. And of course there are myriads of tour groups usually with the guide shouting into a microphone.

If you can cope with all of this, the Forbidden City and its gardens are still lovely and the history very interesting."
A must see with a guide to explain the different buildings. Very large and a lot to see but can get a bit minotomous by the end.
"Love to see this palace with thousands years of history.
Not an easy place for the people with walking problems, have to walk and walk to see the palace."
"Between the walls of these great buildings, comes dynasties of history, thanks to our great guide Mae, she knew it all. A must see in Beijing."
"Nice palaces, nice wooden structures, nice musums, wheelchair friendly area, huge without any plants or trees for some hours of walking, repeated painting patterns, awesome garden at the imperator residence. Very crowded during summer."
"A must see, unbelievable artwork which the Chinese government are restoring. Wonderful history and so hard to believe all built by manpower. The moat round the exterior wall has generated a hill on which further buddist temples have been built. Well worth the experience. Weather in May was a little hot but the days were pleasant."
"It any eye opener on the history of China and the life of Chinese Emperors of long ago,their lifestyle,their leadership and ceremonies they performed. It covers a massive area and has high walls which made it impossible for enemies of those days to break into the enclosure. Make sure you buy a translator at the gate before you get in and it will explain everything every step of the way. It's a place not to be missed"
Worth visiting while in Beijing. Beautiful buildings and plenty to see. The price of entrance was 60RMB. Most of the buildings were similar so might be worth renting the audio tour if you are interested to understand more of what each building was for.
"Honestly, you're better off stopping for some photos in Tiananmen Square, then heading to the Jingshan park behind the Forbidden City and climbing to the top to see the Forbidden City from above. These two experiences are far more intriguing than entering the Forbidden City itself, as it's simply a long walk filled with buildings that always look the same and have information almost exclusively in Chinese (so you're not even quite sure what you're seeing!). I would equate the journey through the Forbidden City to a journey through IKEA - fun for the first 15 minutes or so, and then just as everything starts to look the same, until you realize there is only one way out and you have another hour or so before you get to it!"
"First of all, prepare yourself for lots of walking! It was a fairly warm day too. We had a guide take us through the Forbidden City. The size was surprising but a wonderful experience. Also prepare yourselves for the crowds. We did go as soon as it opened and was already very busy. The gardens at the end were beautiful. Allow lots of time too so you can appreciate it."
So glad that we spent time here. I wish we had more than a couple hours to spend here. Worthwhile great photos. Expect crowds
"My favorite movie is The Last Emperor, so of course, for me, this was a must see experience. It was sincerely amazing to walk in to the Forbidden City. If you haven’t watched The Last Emperor, I recommend a watch before heading to this site. It will definitely bring the experience to life."
"I got there just after 9am, bought the tickets on arrival and spent most of the day there. There is soooo much to see. Make sure you get an audio guide, they're so worth it. All you need to do is stick it in your ear, and it'll play when you get to places of interest. Its GPS guided. It also knows where you have visited and has a route of all the landmarks within the city. Such a clever little thing. That aside, remember to take your passport because the passport number becomes your main ticket. Some other section require additional tickets but they're relatively cheap so go on go see them. Who knows when you'll be back again."
"Make sure you are well rested before going!

I did not go as part of a tour group or have guide. For 30 yuan you can get an audio guide which will lead you on a tour as well as explain what you are looking at. A great way to do it as you go at your own pace.

Plenty of options to buy food and water and shop. Remember to bring your passport as you will need it to buy tickets and get through security checks. As you enter the city signs say you must pre-purchase tickets. Approach the visitors centre and they will point you to a booth to purchase tickets.

There's a heck of allot of walking, it's a big place but you cannot come to Beijing and not see it."
Wonderful visit to the Forbidden City- really impressive site and guide. Highly recommended tour and guide a visit not to miss.
"We booked the Forbidden City and Great Wall (Mutianyu) as a day tour through Viator. The tour operator was China Highlights. Although we didn't go to the museum, we saw the Forbidden City in the morning before going to the Great Wall. Our guide, Rico, was outstanding. He was knowledgable and gave us valuable insights as we toured. The tour was crowded with tourist groups identified by their different colored hats and various flags carried by the guides, but it was interesting and worth fighting the crowds, especially since Rico bought the tickets and we sailed right through the collection points without waiting in lines. The Forbidden City is especially amazing from a historical perspective."
"Although we had heard of it and even watched some movies about it, having the chance to be there in person surpassed any expectation. So much history behind it. Make sure to go with a guide not only to make the most out of it but also to skip the long lines"
"This is a must go in Beijing! It’s huge and full of history.

We hired a private guide through the Grand Hyatt where we stayed and our guide was good but I wish he gave more juicy stories as I’m sure there were lots!

After reading the reviews, I went ahead and watched the movie the Last Emperor and it really helped put things into perspective and appreciate this Palace more.

The architecture and design is not as beautiful as the Summer Palace or Temple of Heaven in my opinion. You kind of walk, see a big red and gold structure, keep walking, see another similar structure, then keep walking on a straight line... they do have a cool Imperial garden with trees that resemble humans and cool rocks.

If you just walk on your own, it may not be as impressive, so I’d definitely recommend getting a good guide who can tell you about all the stories about the eunuchs, the concubines, etc"
"Visited on a tour while in Beijing for work. 999 1/2 rooms; beautiful artwork on the many buildings; lots of jade. Must see when in Beijing. Make sure to arrive early and avoid the crowds ... also, expect to walk a lot."
No words needed! A place to see... 999 rooms across the Forbidden City! It is very impressive once you are inside
"First, remember to bring ID, otherwise you won't get even close to the entrance. If you hold a foreign passport, don't bother to purchase tickets in advance. There is a special booth for foreigners, and surprisingly there was no queue the day we visited. We just walked directly to the counter. Never happen in any major tourist attraction! Despite of the huge area of the Forbidden City, it is quite crowded in some major areas. However, it is not worse than any other major attractions around the world. It is huge, a lot of walking. While the main buildings are the major must sees, it is also interesting to stroll around those smaller buildings off to the side.

The exit is at the north of the City. We walked along the perimeter after exiting. The surrounding is really beautiful and calm. It looks like it is a popular place to take wedding pictures. Also, if you want to visit Tiananmen Square, you may want to do it before Forbidden City, otherwise you have to go all the way back as we did by bus."
"I expected a small building or two... I was so wrong, it went on forever, each section adding to the spectacular site that is the forbidden city"
"I had always wanted to visit the Forbidden City but unfortunately I came away underwhelmed. As other reviewers have said the city is impressive but offers little in the way insight or access as you might expect from other historical treasures around the world.

Up to 40,000 people visit the city each day and it’s a scrum to get anywhere near the open doorways. I hired the audio guide which was reasonably interesting but could be so much better.

Tickets can be purchased on the day if you arrive early. The office is not obvious and located to the right of the main ticket check area. Like many attractions you will need to show your passport when you purchase the ticket.

I’m glad I ticked it off my bucket-list but wouldn’t race back to see it again if I ever travel back to Beijing. Allow 2-3 hrs max."
"We did the Forbidden city by ourselves, it was mind blowing, this is a full day type of tour, and we could have spent more, we walked 20 minutes from our hotel, in hindsight we should have taken transport as once inside the city is enormous and you walk forever to see everything. We went on a Saturday, very very busy but still got around, also got headphones for more information about each structure, very informative, however we walked a very long way before we actually got to the headphone office, signage is not that clear. The history is amazing and so worth a long and tiring day. Do not be tempted to get a pedicab back to your hotel, we did, we negotiated a price before we got in and then taken to an alley within sight of our hotel and extra cash demanded, driver actually starting shoving me until my wife threatened to call police....be very careful."
Forbidden city to me is the most important sight in Beijing. It is large area so reserve some time. Great place to see the influence of the dynasties.
"Went on May 1st & were caught with a huge crowd. But managed to overcome it, since it was our fist time to visit the place. A lot of locals that day..seems like a million people around the area. Three (3) train stations been closed to managed crowd & safety."
"Great historical place, but need the audio tour to get much information. Also need to book online early in order to get a ticket to get in."
"it was very interesting to see really
how big the forbidden city is, it goes on forever.
one thing that did disappoint me was that you really can't see in any of the rooms. They have a rope at the door, and then another rope that in some cases you can't near the place from 20 feet away. Other countries we have visited, let you in the rooms, or at least much closer to the doorway to truly see in.
it would be good to bring a map with you so you know the different sections that you are seeing.
not to be missed"
"The Palace Museum is wonderful to see, make sure you go to the Palace Garden and enjoy the ""Dragon Tree"" and trees, bushes and flowers."
"if you come to china you have to see the summer palace, forbidden city, the great wall and the Tiananmen square! be aware to avoid the chinese holidays or you will be surrounded by groups and more groups of chinese tourists
if you are unfamiliar with the history of this place i would recommend seeing the movie ""last emperor"" before you come here :)"
"Once you get past the masses of people that have this need to be first, the place is amazing. Tons to see and do. Walking the grounds is easy and allows you to go at your own leisure. Architecture and history abounds!

Only complaint? Very few of the people that work there speak anything except Chinese. But google translate was invaluable."
Shows how earlier Royals used to live. Quite a big area. Requires 2-3 hours. Better take audio system to enjoy
"We entered from the other side of Tianamen Square and crossed the square. My wheeled walker proved invaluable in this escapade. I took long rests and eventually made it out the gate--probably a 3 mile hike. Was even interviewed by some ""high school"" students (they call it ""middle school""). Saw many interesting buildings from the exterior; my husband got to go into some of them."
"Another iconic location, that i am glad i was there to take my pictures, and realized what i am looking at, from the pictures i see on the internet. This place is very big, and i did not expect that, but now that i have been, i would like to go visit again, and spend more time"
"It takes all day, overcrowded. You must to visit it to understand capacity, greatness of the area. ."
"Majestic well preserved palace, garden and exhibition halls. Try to go with guide or rent audioguide for more insight about the museum palace.
It is a huge area but still almost every corner is packed with tourist.
Prepare for those crowds all year long."
"Loved the ancient history and enjoyed our private tour to see this magical place. Would highly recommend this .Its best to have a tour guide or you will be battling long lines and crowds. There is temple after temple, but thats the beauty of seeing ancient history. It is just a few hours trip not a whole day."
It is really crowded most of the year but our winter time have us many sites without tourist crowds. Go early with a guide & then stay to walk the entire complex. We booked a 4 hour Viatour group tour & were the only 2 on tour. It was a special treat to not be rushed or crowded.
"We were not impressed... nice item to cross off of the bucket list, but the crowds and lines were excessive. See"
I was really quite unimpressed with this place. The ticket price is way over priced - there is nothing to see inside apart from walls and empty rooms. Not worth the money imo but of course it’s difficult to miss it while in Beijing.
"I was very keen to see this of course, a highlightof a beijing trip however it goes on and on, temple after temple, there are so many people it is plain claustophobic and it was incredibly hot, with little shade from the sun or the beam from the ground itself. I am still glad iv visited it but its done now."
It was really hard to figure out where to get the ticket. The place was super crowded. You’ll see as beautiful buildings in other locations as well.
"The forbidden city - palace museum is an excellent experience of ancient Chinese imperial life; you can have a chance to see how they use to live. Make sure you leave yourself plenty of time. The palace will close around sunset. This area is hugely heavily secured, you will be monitored, and have to go through security checkpoints, and make sure you bring your passport, you will need it for the security inspection stations and to purchase your ticket. I would suggest leaving anything that might be considered a weapon at home."
"I visited as part of a tour group so don’t know the entrance cost. This is a splendid place to visit, there are many building to view and photograph as you move through, it’s one way in and one way out, moving through the city towards the back and exiting through the gardens. Plenty of photographic opportunities. located on the left hand side in one of the Gate Houses you can dress in traditional costume and have your photograph taken.
There are several toilets and a few shops selling souvenirs, we found one selling soft drinks and chocolates opposite the last courtyard on the left just before entering the Gardens. This is a highlight of visiting Beijing and Definitely worth a visit I would have liked to have stayed longer, it closed at 5 o’clock when we visited in May 18."
The colours and architecture make for many photos opportunities. The history of this area transports you back in time. Wear comfortable shoes as there is lots of walking. Make sure you know where the exit is when you are ready to leave as a wrong turn may have you walking and extra 45 minutes to find the exit.
This is the Largest palatial structure in the world. The movie Last emperor was shoot here. China’s Emperor and Empress live here. Need to walk 2 hours as there are a lot of tourist visiting this site. Need your passport for identification and will yndergo inspection of your bags.
"It is pretty complicated if it your 1st trip there....my suggestion is
1) take subway to tien an men east station
Follow the signages n join the crowd to tian an men square 1st cos after the sq u proceed to the compound of forbidden city n if u hv book yr ticket online remember Do Not proceed to any counters Just go straight to the entrance wz yr qr code or paper ticket for entrance.Remember.if not u hv to walk one big round n enter from the eastern which will waste another 20mins or abt 1 extra km of walking.
2) Never go on weekend....its hell of lot of people 60000 onwards....so cannot get to see much."
"I had a great time, so many palaces again and again, just amazing. Do take pictures but it is more fun to let others take your picture and vise versa.A great chance to meet locals as most of the people will be Chinese as this is a must go pilgramage."
"The Forbidden City, home to the emperors in the Ming and Qing dynasties, is the imperial palace complex that sprawls over 250 acres and contains pavilions, halls, courtyards and gates showcasing treasures of China’s imperial past. Listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site, we were able to enjoy a rare glimpse into a world that was off limits to all but the reclusive royals for 500 years. The Inner Court is more intimate than the formal Outer Court, because this is where the emperor, empress and the many concubines actually lived. It was ""forbidden"" to all others. The buildings are all empty having been stripped after the war by what is now Thailand..... probably one of the reasons China wants Thailand back."
"If you are interested in culture, visit a museum, if you are interested in political, you can visit capital, if you want to learn a long history in a short time, the Palace Museum is only choice I recommondated, visited Palace Museum, you will never regret."
It seems to go on forever but you cannot really get to see very much as entry is blocked to all the buildings. It is a must visit location when in Beijing but rather disappointing.
Avoid public holiday as some of the subway stations might be closed. Follow the crowd to the entrance on the right side from the square. The ticket counter will be on the left but you have to walk further inside. It is a huge area. Take your time if you want to appreciate the architecture. They have free wifi in designated area with benches for you to rest.
This place is huge and crowded. It is interesting but if you have already seen temples and Emperor related places and time is short then you might enjoy the Summer Palace more.
You can feel the history as you enter. It’s an amazing place to be. Simply beautiful. Well kept. Clean. You must visit when in Beijing.
This place is in top of the list for all travelers in Beijing. You will find this place crowded almost every time. Palace is huge in the center of the city. The entrance to the palace is from historic Tiananmen Square. I recommend to study a bit about it to enjoy your visit
"The Forbidden City is very impressive and definitely worth a visit. I don’t think I realised how big it would be - it is HUGE. Make sure you wear comfortable shoes as you walk a lot.

We went as part of a China Highlights group tour that also went to the Great Wall and Tiananmen Square. It was definitely beneficial having a guide to explain the significance of various things but not essential."
"Every single stone in this complex matters, that's why it is worth visiting with an experienced guide. Having it said, it is worth to do some prestudy on chinese history and culture, to be able to navigate through the dynasties."
"Gigantic, gigantic place full of people. Felt like we just got pushed along. Have to go to see the magnitude of size this place is. Just be ready for crowds. We went on a Tuesday, which is apparently a busy day with it being closed on Mondays."
Very busy but well worth a visit to see one of the most historic buildings in the world a must do when visiting Beijing
"Large - an example of the wealth and power of the emperors. An exclusive city area for the emperor and the few admitted to serve and service him.

As in other museum areas, the Chinese approach to tourism is that entrance to palace rooms is restricted to taking photographs from a doorway - along with several hundred other (mainly Chinese) tourists."
"Wow, this place is huge but it is so crowded with people visiting. Difficult to see all you want. Worth a visit though as it is stunning."
One of the main attractions in Beijing and a good pace to see. For those traveling not in a tour group it is always for just about most of the main attractions in Beijing to go EARLY. There is a personal headset walking tour that you can get and there are a few other exhibits within that you need to pay extra. I spent about 2-3 hours here and I think that it was plenty of time to see everything that I wanted to see. The area surrounding the Forbidden city is definitely also worth seeing.
Maybe the main Attraction of Beijing. Take 2-3 hours to visit . Guided tour very recommended. Was built at 1420 by the Ming Caesar Dynasty that ruled til 1644. Astonishing buildings and the story behind .
"The Forbidden City is amazing and a must see when you are in China. Make sure to be on a tour or if you are going it alone, you can get a personal headset. One tip, do not allocate too much of the day to the Forbidden city. As amazing as it is, it’s no more than a 2 hr trip, and that’s being generous. Explore Hutong and the surrounds."
We were 25 with a guide chosen by Seabourn cruises and although it was very CROWDED with Chinese we loved the Museum.
"The palace museum have several halls and it would take you at least two hours to go around it. But since the entrance gate looks somewhat the same, you can actually skip some halls and just choose the ones that you like. That way, you could save time and allow you to visit another place. But if you have the whole day to go around it, you'll be able to appreciate each halls better. It could also be a bit crowded though, so you might want to spend more time on each side to capture a better view."
"As with most travellers, this was on our Bucket list of must see and do. The home of the emperors of China and their families until 1911. The visit allows you to appreciate how the emperors lived and the major part of the population had little or no idea. The visit also depicts the style of living of the emperors over centuries and basically they had little of no idea of what was going on outside the walls of the city. Be prepared to walk and share the place with numerous others also looking."
"A trip to Beijing needs to include a visit to the Forbidden City. It was the home to the emperors of China and their families. He was the only male allowed in and was served by numerous eunuchs. His queen, 72 concubines and his children also lived there. The building architecture is unique although visitors are not allowed inside some buildings. A lot of walking is involved and the visit is improved by a guide service. There is also some beautiful gardens."
Much read about this but nothing compares when you are there and you actually see it and learn about the history of this site. Is better to book a tour for this so you learn more about this historic site. Be prepared that you will walk since it expands over a kilometre long. A mut visit if you are in Beijing.
"Yes, it is famous and great. but, actually, it is rather monotonous and quickly bores. Much more impressing and diverse other places in the city like Lama Temple or Confucius Temple"
An amazing feeling to walk around the ancient art affects and get the feeling of an bygone era full of mistery
This is not a single palace as we think of it in the UK. This is a vast site with many buildings. There is one route through (south to north) but you can go backwards and forwards all you like between the buildings. It is the colour of the decoration and the architecture that make this place special and you need to give yourself time to immerse yourself in the history of the great leaders of China. This is a must. Seing this in the fleash is real China history.
This is a must see attraction in China and many tourists would go to Beijing just to see this attraction alone. Be prepared wwith hat and water and go to the bathroom before you visit as the WC facilities are pretty bad here.
"It's a large area and difficult to cover quickly so you need to set aside a few hours.
Also in hot weather you need a cap. There isn't a lot of shade."
"Whatever you think you will be totally in awe of the surroundings. We have all seen this on tv, in magazines, newspapers and travel shows. Nothing compares to being there. Fantastic amount of history, so much to see you need to spend days here. Expect to queue for everything TIC. Amazing place."
Very interesting and amazing. Would have liked more time here. Spent a lot of time waiting for a western toilet which I would not rate as high as they did ( see picture). It gets very crowded so try to avoid Chinese holidays and weekends.
"Finally I came to the Forbidden City. I liked it a lot. Every time I watch a TV show, I really like it. It was so beautiful that it took 4 hours to leave in the Forbidden City."
"A fantastic place to visit. Whilst the queues were long (we visited during the holiday period), the lines moved quickly. Wonderful architecture and well preserved and maintained."
"Spent 4 hours covering the grounds of the palace. Went on a Sunday so it was packed with tour groups, families and friends. An enriching trip otherwise."
"we booked tickets prior to visiting and this saved time.
easy to find from the metro and easy to find the way around. lots to see and something for everyone with garden areas, temples, and inspiring architecture and history."
"You have seen it in so many movies, but nothing beats being there in person to understand the scale and impact of this historical location. Go with a guide so that you can really understand and digest the meaning of the forbidden city. Even on a rainy day, it was fantastic."
"The Forbidden City or Palace Museum as now called has been the residence of rulers of MING and QING Dynasty. The 3rd Emperor of the Ming Dynasty, Emperor Chengzu started the construction of this Palace complex in 1407 and was completed in 1420.The Palace complex which has more than 8700 rooms covers an area of around 74 hectares is surrounded by a 52 meter wide moat and 10 meter high walls. Ancient Chinese Astronomers believed that the Purple star Polaris was the center of heaven and the Heavenly Emperor lived in Purple palace. And as it was forbidden for common man to enter the Palace without Emperor’s permission ,this Palace was also called ‘The Purple Forbidden City’.
The Forbidden City was declared a World Heritage Site in 1987 and has one of the largest collection of preserved wooden structures in the world ."
"This is a large complex that takes a long time to walk through. We had a guide that was able to condense the information about the Forbidden City into sizeable chunks to make to it easier for us to digest. I would highly recommend using a guide to get a good understanding of what you are seeing, otherwise after a while the buildings will all start to look the same.
It was busy with a lot of people which was not too bad bad except at the doors to the palaces. You can’t enter and the doorways are narrow for the amount of people trying to see in there. There really isn’t much to see anyway so we gave them a miss after the first few crushes.
We were there for a few hours and would have liked more time, especially would have liked more time on our own after the ‘tour’. The complex really is more impressive than what I had seen in pictures."
"The Forbidden City is located just north of Tian'anmen Square and is steeped in history from the past several hundred years. You cannot really appreciate the sheer immensity of this landmark without taking a walk through the area yourself. To do a basic tour of the key buildings on the site takes a few hours, but is done in a linear path from the entrance at the south gate to the exit at the north gate. If you want to spend a full day or more here, you can venture off on all of the east and west halls and gates and explore the Forbidden City in its entirety. This is a definite must-do if in Beijing and I recommend using a prebooked reputable tour guide for ease of access and history, especially if busy."
"The forbidden city visit is enjoyable with a lot of photos to be taken with a a beautiful architecture.
Prepare yourself for 3 hours at least of this preserved amazing cultural experience"
"There were new sections open for this visit, as well as an exhibition, which was excellent. Enjoyed walking on the wall and discovering new areas. If you go, give yourself a few hours (at least 3-5 hrs), it’s a big place. Note that we had to pay online via a QR code, which was not that clear to s foreigner - (it also looked like you could buy your tickets on line). Part of the process was in Chinese, so you may need some help. You definitely need a passport or identification. Make sure you climb Jingshan Park upon your exit (across the road), for a great view of the Forbidden City. Note that there is some restoration work being done in certain areas."
Judy Dong also known as Tours By Judy of Beijing took me here as part of our 2- day private tour. Judy is extremely knowledgeable of the China history and her English is excellent which made my trip more enjoyable.
"Our guide from China Highlights was amazing. Wish I had recorded her. The rituals, the history, the life there in that time, the intrigue, the mystery, the power, the sheer amazement of how they even constructed this. Incredible. You shake your head and wonder...how did they do all this. Don't miss it."
"Wonderful time here .. we got to learn the culture and history of China ... visiting the palace was a great idea but there was so many people .. you could barely see something .. or walk in some spots.
However we enjoyed and we are happy that we made it."
"one thing that was amazing for me in this city, it was that there was no flower , no trees , no greens in this city.
this city was belong to chines king at old time."
"Not a lot to say except you have to see it while in Beijing. Although expect a lot of Chinese tourists and queue for the tickets, but nothing you can do about that so just enjoy this iconic place."
"The forbidden city is right in the heart of Beijing. It's a palace city which gets boring after half an hour.
You can't enter in any of the palaces.
You have to walk a lot. There's a paid audio recording available at the gate to understand about the palace history. Also you need your passport to get in to this place.

I would suggest you to skip this place."
"Amazing imperial buildings. Must see. A lot of tourists, especially Chinese. An alternative if you don't have much time or is
Beijing Working People's Cultural Palace nearby, cheaper and less crowded."
"I just loved the sense of history and the beautiful blue ceiling decorations and friezes. It was packed the day we visited, but it did not feel that way. As it’s huge. Chinese emperors surely built to impress on vast scale. And impressed we were. There are 9999.5 rooms – and no, we did not count them. Too little time. Too much to see. The Golden stream inside forbidden city is shaped to resemble a Tartan bow. And indeed, it does, once you know what to look for. There are 5 small marble bridges over the stream. The moat around the forbidden city 52m wide - for security and to impress I guess. Visitors are now limited to 80.000 per day. At times the number of visitors would exceed 140.000 per day. Even now there are queues at entrance. Pairs of bronze or stone guardian lions guard stairs and doors. Roof guardians are mythical creatures leading/protecting the dragon (emperor). The more mythical creatures on roof top, the more imperial the building. Bronze turtles indicate longevity and stability. Incense was burned inside. Smoke billowing from mouth on special occasions. Must have been a marvelous view. Copper and bronze vats (308) were filled with water for dousing fires. In winter, they were draped in quilts or warmed with fires to keep them from freezing over. No discounts. No dressing code. Long queues, depending on day. Understand one can now buy ticket online. Put on good walking shoes. Plenty of walking. You can easily spent a full day there. No food around. Bring your bottle of water and something to nibble. There are toilet facilities in several places. We came with a tour. That's good, because we were dropped off almost at entrance. If not, I understand there's quite some walking to do to get to the entrance. Does not matter. Just enjoy the mystery of the place. Still around today, despite the crowds."
"While there is an option to do a tour that lasts an hour, why would you? This is a place that needs hours to fully explore. I was there for four and probably only saw three quarters of it. It is an incredible tribute to imperial age. Temples and palaces abound with different things revealed. It is also very tourist friendly with lots of places to eat, rest, grab a drink or use a bathroom. These do sort of interrupt the monument a little but they are necessary. It is a massive complex.
A few things to be aware of: it does attract local crowds on weekends, so if possible, go on a weekday. It is still busy, but once you have your ticket and are inside, you can get away from the crowds. Buying a ticket beforehand is probably a good idea, I didn't though and was only in the line for about 15 minutes. You do need your passport if you are not a local, although some people showed pictures of their passport ID photo page and that seemed to be ok. Take your passport to be sure. Finding the ticket office is a little challenging, it is outside the gate to the forbidden city, which if you are entering from Tiananmen Square is NOT the first massive gate you come through, the ticket window is at the end of the plaza that is through that gate. That first gate is the gate of heavenly peace. Security is intense. There are at least two checkpoints for bag xray and searching, and you'll need your passport for both. There are signs in English in many places that relate to the structures but I suggest you hire an audioguide. They're cheap and work very well. Incidentally an entry ticket to the city is also very cheap.
I enjoyed my hours wandering, hopefully you will too."
"It's so beautiful. I love history, vintage and medieval stuff. If i get the chance I would definitely go back here, It's so big and even if you walk all day you cannot see everything. Audio translator is a must"
"Very beautiful site with a fascinating history. Can only see everything from the outside, but definitely worth the visit. And when you exit, make to take the walk to the top of the pagoda in the adjacent park. A bit of a challenging walk up, but really beautiful and the views from the top are the best in Beijing."
"No map or tour book can prepare you for the sheer size and the crowds. I've NEVER seen this many people at any historical attraction anywhere else in the world. Take water with you! Literally, there are thousand and thousands of people inside and the limited bathrooms are of the typical Chinese variety, so be aware of your needs before you decide to go in, or you'll regret that decision. I can't stress highly enough that you should get a professional tour guide for this tour, if for no other reason than the astounding tix lines."
Fantastic morning again Jimmy was a great guide very knowledgeable in all aspects aspects of the history. This is an absolute must for anybody who goes to Beijing. We also went back the next night to see the lights lit up around tenement square and the Forbidden City quite a surprise treat
"The complex of buildings is beyond comprehension and I really can't say we saw them all, as I think this is impossible in a day! It is phenomenal really, and the complexity of the glazed tiling and the gorgeous buildings generally, are something else. This complex could be the singular reason to plan a trip to Beijing!"
"This is a very popular place and perhaps a tick mark for every tourist, I did not find it amazing as such, but yes one time visit is good."
Forbidden City-The Palace Museum is one of a kind place. You will enjoy walkin in the palace and cross all the buildings that were the kingdom palace.
"Nearly half a million visitors lined up to enter Tiananmen Square on the day we visited. If one is not put off by the throngs and one has a knowledgeable guide to explain some of the underlying details one would be fascinated by the history and culture of the emperors in years gone by. After a full 3 hours, one would still not have done justice to the complex in Tiananmen Square."
"Enjoyed this place more than Tiananmen Square. Very impressive buildings. Took a train about 30 min from Beijing. Very easy to navigate the Subway system - tickets , everything is in English. Bring your passports to purchase for less hassle. Probably need half a day for here and Tiananmen Square."
We really enjoyed the scale and vastness of the forbidden city. There was lot of beautiful architecture and the grounds were beautiful. We had a guide who was excellent at giving us a lot of the history and the Chinese perspective. I highly recommend the guide
"Well worth the trip, so interesting but take a guide or book a tour. We booked a tour with ChinaTour which covered the Forbidden City, Summer Palace and Temple of Heaven. Trip included lunch, just ok, but I'm not a fan of Chinese Food!! Cost about $40 but was well worth it as collection from the hotel was included."
If you doing free & easy trip make sure to do your homework on entrance ticket. The place is huge after you enter from the Tiananmen you have to keep on walking to the entrance tickets checking site and search for the entrance ticket counter which is on the right corner of the entrance. I have asked a few people there and all tell me to buy tickets on line. Remember to bring your passport & good walking shoes. After exist walk through the underpass & hike up the garden top to see the sky view of the city. It amazing.
"We booked this tour on our first day in Beijing. We weren't sure what to expect, but this tour, from beginning to end, exceeded our desires for a comprehensive tour. We were picked up at our hotel by our tour guide, Leo and a driver. Traffic was heavy and he was a little late, but he called ahead to let us know. The car was comfortable and they even provided bottled water.

Leo was friendly, spoke excellent english, was patient with our questions, and was knowledgeable about every aspect of the city. We highly recommend touring this way. We were able to enjoy the day and never felt rushed or overcrowded. Leo knew the exact times for us to visit each site as not to run into crowds that were too large.

The sites speak for themselves! Rich history. We made plenty of great memories and captured unforgettable photos of all of the major places. Lunch was at a local Hot Pot restaurant. One word, delicious!

Thanks Viator for providing a day to remember, that was exactly as advertised. No complaints at all! Worth every penny!!"
"It’s a total zoo. Total. Your best bet is to go there, find a private tour guide - around 300 rmb - and put a time limit on it. Wear a mask. The pollution in Beijing is unbearable. And stay away from the traditional tea ceramony show. They try to get you to buy tea that costs 200 bucks. Total rip off"
"This is an immensely important site to the people of China and is very worthy as such. The sheer size of the buildings and complex is remarkable, but it is repetitive and they buildings are quite similar. It is not possible to go inside any buildings, only peer into a few of them. Tickets may be purchased ahead of time and passport numbers are necessary. There is security screening before entering the Forbidden City. It will take over an hour to walk through the grounds."
This was part of a 2 day tour we only had time to spend a couple of hours here but you could easily spend a lot longer
"This is the number 1 visit tourist attraction if you are visiting China for the first time.
Well known for its rich history and culture. This place is simply amazing and huge.
Recommended to read up on some background history before visiting.

Wear comfortable shoes and take amazing pictures, this place will leave your feet crying in pain for the next few days.

Appreciate the beauty of this infrastructure and its function, recommended duration- half a day."
"The forbidden city is a must see for any traveller, I was almost 6 hours walking and seeing the palaces.

Steeped in Ming and Qing history, and further back, to 2600 years bc.
However the jade can be bought cheaper at the Panjiayuan market, accessible by subway line"
This place is huge. Lots of history and knowledge to soak in. Architecture is amazing. Lots of walking so wear the walking shoes.
"We visited as part of a tour, we were only there for a couple of hours, you would need a lot more time to walk the whole site. It a very large area, most of the buildings are intact, some still have a few of the original furnishings in them, I enjoyed the historical information the guide gave, lots of interesting information, although it was very clean and rubbish free, I think it would have benefited from a good dusting of the artefacts left in situation, because they were covered with years of dust which make them look unloved, hopefully they get around to a more detailed clean in the future."
I hadn't realised how big the Forbidden City was or how stunning the architecture is - you need a whole day to take your time and let the sights and sounds sink in. It is a lot of walking but well worth the effort - truly amazing.
"This site was on my bucket list and it did not disappoint. seeing it live was well beyond my expectations. From Mao's mausoleum to the iconic entrance this is the place to see. Even if you are there on business, take the time to visit this site"
"This is a nice place to visit but very busy.
The only downside is how disrespectful the Chinese people are even to their own historically important attractions.
Trembling Over everything and spitting on things.

Besides this factor it’s worth a visit"
"This was a real treat but was very crowded even in the mid morning when we arrived. Lots of history here ! Bring comfortable shoes , a water bottle and your CAMERA as there is a picture almost everywhere you look !"
Quick tourist stop with colleagues on a tour of Beijing. Definitely worth seeing one of the best known attractions in the city! Bring water if it's hot and be prepared that it will be BUSY!!
"The Forbidden city can get very busy and very hot on a sunny day, you have to be careful when walking some surfaces are uneven, the garden is lovely very tranquil with the flowers and trees and the rock formations."
"Absolutely amazing and such a huge complex. Incredible that these buildings have survived wars, revolutions and more. Well worth the visit."
"We went here without a tour guide on our last day in Beijing. To buy tickets on the day, pass under Mao's portrait and keep walking straight ahead down the main path, following directions for the 'ticket check' area (about a 5-10 minute walk from the portrait depending on the crowds). Once you stand in front of the 'ticket check' gates, look to your right and there will be a nondescript building with booths and a bunch of tourists waiting in line. This is where you will be able to get a ticket for 60 RMB after showing your passport. Bring your walking shoes because the place is huge. The buildings are impressive. Prepare to wait to be able to look inside the buildings - it was absolutely heaving with people."
"This place is huge. Really huge. After two hours walking through the whole place you still have seen only the most important buildings, but not the hundred buildings on the side. Incredible."
"The Forbidden City is simply fascinating, the construction of this place took many years and it cost many lives. There are 3 core section to the structure and each one has a story to tell, there are many corners and turns it's a great place to learn about the history and see the area that people used to live in.

Many of the great halls and palaces are sealed off to the public but you are able to see from the barriers into the internal structure. The whole place you will probably need a day to cover if you're not in a rush. There is no quiet time in this area as tourists crowds almost every part of this historical sight. It's a must see when you're in Beijing."
Forbidden City (a building-after-building complex/ palace) and Great Wall are the greatest historical places of Beijing.
"Walk around Tinanmen square and enter the Forbidden City; this is the former imperial palace from the Ming dynasty and full of exciting surprises around each corner. We spent several hours here and could have spent longer but became hungry for Chinese food. The magnificent displays and ambiance create an awe-inspiring experience.
On the day we arrived early in the morning there were very few crowds, which allowed us to explore in comfort and discover the wonders of this impressive attraction. There are so many opportunities to sit and reflect and just be in the moment and feel the history wash over you.
Truly amazing experience, a must see when in Beijing. Although Tinanmen square was a mystery to us; where it started and ended so we never had any major thoughts about it."
"We went on a tour that included Tiananmen Square and the Forbidden City. The Forbidden City is spectacular. It's HUGE. And GORGEOUS! I could have spent all day there taking pictures and learning history, but we went as part of a tour. We got to see the Empress Dowager Cixi's living space, and the garden at the back of the palace. 9 is a lucky number is China and the Forbidden city has 9,999 rooms. Having a guide was pretty cool because there's no way we would have learned as much as we did without Lina. There is so much beauty here, don't forget to look up! Also, we bought ice creams from a vendor that were delicious. We didn't get to see everything, if I was doing it on my own I would plan to spend an entire day here.

Oh yeah, you cannot bring matches or a lighter in to the Forbidden City, they make you leave it when you enter.

I really enjoyed my morning/afternoon at the Forbidden City and recommend it to those visiting Beijing."
"Went here with a tourgroup and walked all the way from the entrance to the north gate and passend all important building on the axis. It was crowded with Chinese people, especcially at the beginning. It was nice to look and wonder around this place with so much history, but I cant say I’m really impressed by the palaces; the all look the the same and there is few varity in type or shape of buildings. Maybe if we went to one of the side buildings with the exhibitions than it could have more varity, but we didn’t. You cant go inside the temples so that doesn’t help either. The guide did told some old stories from the past so that gave the building some more feeling.
But otherwise I guess you will get board very soon. So do go and buy a ticket just for the sake of visiting the city, or if you want to see it all you can spend all day."
"You must have your passport to buy a ticket! The Forbidden City is steeped in Chinese history. Covering an immense area it is hard to imagine how they kept up with all the rooms! Avoid weekends and holidays because even on an off day there are thousands of tourists with hundreds of tour groups - so go early, take snacks and water and be prepared for lots of walking as you wander the palace grounds looking for the beautiful architectural details! An audio guide or special guide is necessary if you haven't read up and want more details. Gorgeous carved doors with equally beautiful brass hardware.
Don't miss the incredible Imperial Garden with its gorgeous flowers, ancient twisted tree trunks, rock garden and multiple statues, carvings and architectural details! All the rooftops are the golden color and the buildings tend to look alike so read up and have a plan for what you want to see! The main entrance with the portrait of Mao is classic China history. Look across the street to see Tiananmen Square."
"Visit the Forbidden City (recommended between 8:30 and 11:30) - Arrive at the main entrance of the Forbidden City and go inside to see one of the most prominent attractions in Beijing and around the world. The forbidden city (Forbidden City, in Chinese: 故宫) was once the seat of the Chinese emperors and their families. For about 500 years, there were 14 Ming dynasties and ten emperors of the Qing dynasty, until 1924, when the last emperor left the gates of the Forbidden City and never returned. If you ask yourself why this large system of buildings is called the Forbidden City, here's an answer to you: In the days when the Chinese emperors lived, the simple Chinese people were not allowed into the compound. Today, after the Emperors left the compound, you can see buildings with an impressive and colorful architecture, royal gardens and a variety of displays, including royal clothes, tools used by emperors and special watches. We encourage you to switch between the beautiful gardens and the most interesting exhibits. Our favorite shows are the Watch Display, located on the northeastern side of the Forbidden City, and the Opera Gallery, which features a variety of costumes, masks and accessories from the Chinese Opera. Of course, it is possible to spend hours and even days in the Forbidden City, but if you do not want to leave the city gates with exhausted and desperate children, it is recommended to reduce the visit to three hours.
How will you arrive? Make your way from the hotel to Dongsi Subway Station, located next to the supermarket. Take the 5th line and get off at Dongdan Station, where you will replace Line 1. Get off at Tian'anmen East Station and proceed on foot to the Forbidden City."
Guided Day part of our tour. Thank god for the guide or we would not have found five star toilets as well as information about the palace. Very busy with Chinese visitors in very large tour group. He told us it's not busy as horrendous in summer so April good time to go. Need paper for ladies loo as don't do any in these swat loos. Palaces amazingly decorated with elaborate buildings matching Ying yang. So just do one side as exactly the same on each side we took two hours with coach dropped off on Square then pick d up at far end. Coachs are by far the best way. Crazy driving and lots of people an bikes!
Nothing can prepare you for how overwhelming this experience is. The beauty of the seemingly never ending City has to be seen
Not as stunning as I expected and walking distances and steps make this a tiring visit. Glad have been but would not re-visit
i think it was too hyped up for what it really is. the summer palace is thousand times better. but nevertheless if its your visit to Beijing you should at least see it once.
"The home of the emperor, another site most of us would never have been allowed to enter in ancient times. Speaks to the opulence of the emperors. So many courtyards and a garden to explore. Can really take your time to absorb it all."
The forbidden city it might be very busy and full of people but its worth the try! A beautiful construction in the heart of the city. Take the time to enjoy all the little details that you see around.. A guided tour is a must to understand the history of the place
"Be prepared to be amazed by the amount of work that went into making such a place. Over a million workers and hundreds of thousands of artisans made this palace what it is. Paranoid emperors made sure that watch tours were built on the walls and 15 layers of bricks were laid on all the courtyards so that no assasssins could dig there way in. A place rich with history it is an absolute must see.

Why didn’t I give it a 5 rating....be prepared to be buried with other tourist and groups. I wish there was more of the palace that was open to be viewed but for the most part the meridian walk pretty much straight through (which will still take you approximately 2 hours) is pretty much what most tours will give you. I highly suggest getting a tour guide or an audio tour there is so much to learn about this place that housed the royal family of the Ming and Qing dynasties."
"We went through at 10am, the crowds were mammoth and we had to be aggressive to see the attractions up close however it was worth it. The history here is amazing and despite the restorations, visiting here is a must for any trip to China."
"The queue to go through the security check was long. After visited the forbidden city, we cross over to the Jingshan Park. Take a short climb up to the hill for the overall view of the forbidden city."
"I didn't really appreciate my visit at the Forbidden City. I had no idea what anything was, but I probably should have gotten a tour or an audio guide.
The garden part at the end was the better part of it all.
I liked that you could use your ID (passport) as a ticket instead of getting a paper one."
"The two, my fault. An amazing, large site. Only spent two hours, probably my first mistake. I was happy with our guide. Quite informative. But lots of people. A huge site. Difficult to approach room open to viewing due to crowds. I missed any museums which were there, which provide context. Probably a five, had I spent the time. But before I spent a day there I'd be sure I'd know how the time would be spent. And the site, the architecture, probably a seven or eight. Shouldn't be missed."
Rent the audio tour when you visit. Allow at least 3-4 hours. The place is huge ! Be aware that it can be crowded during peak season. Their are a lot of domestic tourists along with foreigners during peak season.
The first area was interesting but it then seemed to go on and on. I couldn't believe how 'simply' the emperor life's - especially if you compare it to the tsars in Russia. My husband needed to use a wheelchair as it was so far-we hired a chair (plus person to push it)... I think it was about $30 which wasn't too bad considering the distance.
The place is huge! Wear your most comfortable walking shoes when you visit the place. Having a tour guide helps as they provide context and history especially if you don't understand Chinese. Prepare for local tourists crowding the place.
"Tickets can be easily bought at the entrance, bring your passport. A guided audio tour is also available in most languages. It is an enormous complex. Some prior learning about the site may be advantageous due to its complexity. A must do tour!"
We were originally going to attempt this place on our own but ended up booking a private guide for the day. Well worth it. We skipped the entrance line entirely which was fantastic as we had young children and we got to enjoy a thorough understanding of this enormous place without having to wear earphones and listening to audio guides with no ability to ask questions. Even with a guide we saw only the main parts as we wanted to see other places of interest as well. We ate lunch inside the forbidden city in a restaurant that had been converted from where they used to store the Palace ice. a delicious lunch that wasn't that expensive. Well worth a visit.
"Enough has been said of this place by other travellers so I won’t elaborate. Don’t join those big group tours that rush you through the site in 2-3 hours. Take a private guide if you have the cash (they don’t take credit cards). Or do a bit of research before hand (historical events, tales of romance, betrayal, loss..etc) and take your time to explore this magnificent palace, including the little side walks, take refuge under beautiful ceiling of pergolas and take a closer look at all the little details (paintings on walls, statues, patterns on windows, statues on eaves)."
Maybe because we go on Saturday so it really crowded with ton of people. Every side of palace are full with people make us feel so dizzy. But we still enjoying our time and learn some history in here. This is the most place you need to come when you are in Beijing but avoid to come on weekend
"When they say... Arrive early, They mean it. We waited for over an hour outside just to be checked at security. Bring your passport!!!! Your bags go through a x-ray machine and then you can go in to buy tickets. Through the second set of doors is the bathroom on the right in the corner. At the back right is a set of ticket window where foreigners can buy tickets. Ignore the signs saying to download the app. You don't have service and the free wi-fi does not work for foreigners. Tickets are cheap.
Once inside there is a mass of people. Don't worry, it thins out after that point. This is a one way trip. The exit is at the other end of the compound. there is a center and two sides. It is impossible to see it all in one day. There at ""Museum shops"" all over the place. They mostly have the same general trinkets but half the items are different. If you see something you like, buy it. Chances are you will not see it again and can't find that shop again. I tried unsuccessfully. Save plenty of time to see the garden in the back since the trees are amazing and really really old. There is food and drinks. Bring plenty of RMB since they charge a higher exchange rate when using a credit card and you pay 10% more. In addition, most food venders will only take cash. I did not feel as bargaining was an option but when I was in the painting shop the sales lady started bargaining with me and I purchase two items at about 40% the original cost. When you go out of the exit there are no taxis as expected so be prepared to walk. If you take a right along with the crowd you willed up at Wangfujing and it is a safe walk among locals. There are shops along the way selling souvenirs, drinks and snacks. But again, have RMB cash as it seems like a long walk. But it really isn't."
"Everything is worth to visit! But it will spend at least 3 hours to visit there! And it is very tired, but it worth it"
Worth seeing but Beijing was so smoggy it made us wonder. Story of taking young girls to be sexual objects for one mans pleasure was not a nice one but that is history full of bad tales.
"All of this built to satisfy the Emperors of the dynasties to serve their largesse. Over 900 buildings, mostly kept in top shape since the 2008 Olympics."
The place is enormous. Had only enough time to see only a few areas of this magnificent place. Highly recommended.
"Very crowded, be prepared to do some walking, Very well cared for buildings. Some artifacts but mainly its the various buildings that you check out."
We visited the Forbidden City 3 days ago and were impressed by the sheer size of the palace as well as the architecture ...... all wooden with interlocking pieces. They were surely ahead of their time! One of the highlights of our China trip!
"We visited this as part of an organised private tour. Unfortunately we only had an hour and a half allocated to see the Forbidden City and arrived an hour before closing due to traffic congestion.

The palace is enormous, and there is just so much to see, I would suggest spending a good half day here at least and taking your time to explore and enjoy.

Despite the unexpected cold snap and drenching rain, this was a wonderful experience and will definitely go back and spend more time exploring this properly."
"Way to big, too many people, buildings without access, overall not too appealing for relaxing visit, worth seeing for the size and history behind it"
"Well worth a visit but be prepared to spend at least 2 to 3 hrs here. Lots of walking- I did 14000 steps! Some small snack and drink stalls there or take your own. Lots of outside walking so be prepared if the weather is not good. Wheelchairs and ‘pushers’ can be hired for thos3 who cannot walk the distance, cost about 200-300 rmb for the visit."
"We went mid morning with Sasha, our tour guide from Catherine Lu tours. We were asked to give her our passport numbers so she could buy tickets ahead of time. There were so many lines and hordes of people waiting to get in. Thanks to Sasha we avoided the lines. She said that the picture of Mao was changed each year to have him age one year in the picture. ""Only"" 350,000 tickets are sold each day. Some days they are sold out, that is how crowded this area is.
The Forbidden City at one time only housed the emperor, his family members, concubines and the eunuch servants. 200,000 workers took 14 years to build the 800 buildings with 9,000 rooms. Feng Shui was used with each main hall facing south. On a map, it looks simple to walk through but there were so many side exits and buildings that it would be very easy to get lost. The architecture and the colors on the buildings were simply beautiful.
Allow 2-3 hours to tour."
"What a wonderful place to spend the day.

There is so much to explore!

Part of the outer wall has been recently opened. Fortunately our private guide knew about it because 99% of the other people there did not.

It provides a much more intimate view of the grounds.

Some of the museum exhibits here were in Chinese only, so we did not get as much out of them as we might have, but still very interesting.

Arrive early to beat some of the crowds.

And don’t rush through. You could easily spend an entire day here wandering the grounds. Get off the main path and explore. Enjoy the park like settings."
"The first thing I will say is make sure you bring your passport if your not a Chinese citizen, we made that mistake and it cost us half a day going there and back to our hotel twice to get them.

The entry fee is about $15 AUS, but it's definitely worth the cost, the whole Forbidden Ciry is absolutely massive, you don't really notice the size of the complex as most people just walk straight through the middle passing through all the biggest buildings.

Generally most people buy their tickets at the Southern entrance and walk in the direction to the North exit.

The two guardian lion statues outside every building makes for a really great photo, I liked the Ming dynasty lions the best, near the end of the Northern exit is a pineapple ice cream stand, their delicious and also make a good photo opportunity.

If you want to get an idea of the size of the Forbidden City then at the end of your walk through to the Northern exit you can then take a short stroll to Jingshen Park, it's just over the road from the exit, its is a hill that has amazing views over the whole Forbidden City, entry is about $2 Aus and the walk takes about 10 - 15 minutes to reach the top."
We bought tickets from the office on the right of the entrance headed “passports”. The passport details then become the ticket when you go through the entrance. Small queue at the office as I think most people are in group tours or buy online. Tickets were about $6NZ. More tickets could be bought within the city to see special exhibitions like the Clocks room. There’s one toilet block that we came across quite a way into the interior.
"Very nice and amazing place.
I advise to visit this unique place in Beijing.
I and family enjoyed lots.
As it's a very big place various palaces inside it , I advise aged people consider their readiness and abilities for a long time of walking and also having some foods and water with themselves.
Thanks"
"We recently visited the Forbidden City while in China and it was absolutely amazing. The history of the city is so interesting and it really made us think about how young Australia is in comparison. It was fairly easy to move around but there are plenty of steps.
Well worth a visit."
"The size of this city can only be appreciated in person. There is a walled courtyard within a walled courtyard, each more spectacular than the previous one, until you finally reach the private rooms of the emperor."
"The Forbidden City is a huge area but this time it was not as crowded as on previous visits. Some of the rooms are being renovated so access was a bit restricted. However, it is wonderful to listen to the guide describe life as it would have been during the reign of the Emperors."
"Its worth a visit, can be a long day if you go on a coach trip as they stop at 3 or 4 places during the day, good footwear is essential i think."
"This palace city is enormous and truly worth the visit. It just keeps going walking from one gigantic courtyard to the next taking in ancient sculptures and buildings. The emperor housed all his family here, make sure you take a guided tour to really understand the figures and items around the buildings and courtyards. Fantastic part of history in China"
"thoroughly enjoyed the experience of visiting this attraction, that gave an insight into the huge depth of China's history"
It is fascinating to see how a Chinese palace looks. The style of architecture is beautiful and all you would expect
"This is a fantastic Palace complex. There is a lot to see, but to maintain the interest of a 6 year old, we didn't see everything. We still managed 3 hours on a hot day.
The main down side is how busy it is. If you want to see inside any of the rooms (you can only view them from the doorway) you need to queue/muscle your way forward.
Oh, and the ticket booth isn't obvious, and you need to take your passport."
"This trip was a great experience! It turned out there were only two of us, so it was a private tour. Our tour guide, Roy, met us at our hotel. From there we took a taxi to within a few blocks of Tiananmen Square. Roy explained the history of the square and details about the surrounding buildings and monuments.

Then we entered the Forbidden City. Roy had purchased our tickets on line, so we didn't wait to go in.He knew a lot about the history and significance of various features. He answered all our questions and provided some key local knowledge that helped us to get around on our own in the ensuing days. Roy encouraged us to take our time and to take as many pictures as we wanted. It was a wonderful day!"
"A long walk through a maze of near-identical buildings. All with a yellow roof, nearly nothing inside and no entry permitted. The near identical buildings have near identical names (Hall of the ......). We had a private guide to provide snippets of historical and cultural context, but when the discussion descends into the minutae of who in the past can or cannot pass through which door or gate it all gets quite boring.
They let 80,000 people in each day, most of them Chinese. Employing a private guide sorts out the hassle of getting tickets and reduces the security checks you are subject to. Try to avoid a rainy day, otherwise there are 80,000 umbrellas getting in your way, blocking your view or intruding into your photographs. As there is no entry to most of the Imperial buildings, you will get quite wet in rain.
Jingshan Park immediately north of the Forbidden City is less crowded and arguably more worthwhile with good views over the Forbidden City and over the White Pagoda. Also much cheaper."
"There isn't much to say that others haven't already said. It's a vast and interesting collection of China's history. Just make sure that:

a. Arrive well before the opening time to get ahead of the lines; and
b. Have a guide of some sort (i.e. in-person, audio, written/book) to maximize your experience

It's a must see attraction, but the only caveat is that I wasn't ""wowed"". Taking in the sights of Forbidden City adds context to the magnitude and history of the site, but visually, it looks very similar to the other historical tourist attractions in Beijing."
Forbidden city is a place that someone should visit. It's gives you an idea of the different dynasties that were in China in the past. We had a tour with Chinatour.net. I would recommend Brad Yao as your tour guide.
I enjoyed this historical location the most of all the historical sites we visited in Beijing. We had a good guide who was informative and learning about the history was valuable.
"Wear comfortable shoes, lots of walking. Lots of people around. Extremely interesting and listen carefully to the guide as they have a lot to tell you. Well worth a visit."
"Obviously this is a tourist trap, but as they say (if in Rome do as the romans do) we went in as a party from Virgin Tours. We were shown how to make and then tasted several different types of tea. Although expensive we did purchase several of the types of tea and had a couple of tea mugs that change colour when you pour the tea inside. You also have a free pee - pee figure that pees when you put hot water over the head."
"1. The Huge Palace
2. 167000 Square Meter for buildings. 8700 rooms.
3. You can imaging how long does it take to visit all :))
4. Full of tourists
5. must have proper shoes, sunglass, water
6. you must manage your time to visit.

Enjoy Your Trip :))"
Its unbelievable how the emperors lived back in the day. A great place to visit. You can self tour as a guide really isnt necessary. Too bad you cant enter the rooms of the Emperors though. Spend the day as its lots of walking.
"It is easy to visit the Forbidden City independently, thereby avoiding following one of the numerous flags and fellow tourists around the vast site.
Just remember to take your passport with you as it will be checked in and out of the museum site. This also applies to getting access to Tiananmen Square, which is across the road. Once you get into the outer court of the Forbidden City go straight ahead to the main entrance, where they check entrance tickets - there is a box office on the right for tourists who are not able to buy a ticket using the QR barcode scanner (they use these a lot in China). Your ticket will be assigned to your passport.
We rented English audio guides, which was worthwhile. You can easily pass a few hours wandering around the vast site.
Use the Metro to get around Beijing - it is really cheap with signposts in English."
One of the main highlights of Beijing. Its a shame though that you do not get the chance to see the rooms of the emperors palace up-close .
"a good Place to visit, you can do a self guided tour or with a tour guide, self guided is easy as you can access via the sub-way or bus system, extra charges apply to quite a few add on areas inside & most viewing is from the exterior of the buildings"
"A person could spend a week here and not see it all! We spent most of the day and barely scratched the surface. We had an excellent guide who knew the history which really helped us understand the sites were we seeing. Highly recommend seeing this, but do believe you will need a guide to really enjoy it."
"Loved the Forbidden City and speding a few hours walking around and relaxing inside amoungst the walls of the old Chinese city.
Make sure you take your passport or you won't be able to enter.
Get there early to avoid crowds and large ques and start at the South entrance and end up at the Park for a view looking down over the roof tops of the Forbidden City.

The Smog was terrible when we were there so the view points were not great which was dissapointing but still a great activity."
"First thing first, remember to bring passport with you as they require passport when buying tickets

Went to the Forbidden City on the last day of my business trip at Beijing in mid September 2017. We arrived at the front around 9 am and it was already filled with crowd, 90% of all are Chinese. My friend use app to buy tickets online so we didn't have to queue. The security was strict tho. No lighters and knife allowed. I can't remember what else.

This place is hughhh so once you get inside, get yourself a map or you can also use Google map. It works.
This place is full of interesting story and it will makes you so curious how they lived in this place hundreds years back. The buidling matterials, furnitures and decorations tell the age of the place. If history is your favourite subject, you MUST visit this place and you will never want to come out. Too bad we need to come out around 11 to get to airport. Otherwise, I would be there till late afternoon.

There are some shops selling snacks and water inside the museum. Toilets are easy to find and acceptably clean. Recomend to go early in the morning. They stop sellng tickets around 15.30 and they will clear people out of this City before sun down."
"If you like history and don't mind the time or the crowd, this is a very good place to visit.

Tips:
1. Bring your passport with you. It will be your ticket to get into the palace. The price is free. If you forget your pp, just show your driver's license, they'll charge minimal amount (120 RMB for 2 adults and one child).
2. Hop on line 1 subway, get off at the Tinamen East. Go through the security.
3. Bring lots of water and lunch boxes or snacks to munch on during breaks.
4. There's no toilet paper, so bring some tissue paper with you and some hand sanitizer, too.
5. Have fun and enjoy being bumped around by old Chinese men and women :)"
"I'm a big history buff so I thoroughly enjoyed this location. My friend spoke Chinese so it was like having a private tour guide through the entire complex. This place is absolutely HUGE so make sure you have the entire day to devote to it, and you better bring some comfy shoes. You get to see the many rooms dedicated to the emperor, concubines, and courtesans. Some of the reviews on here talk about it being stripped of any artifacts but I saw plenty within each building to keep you busy. The entire complex is not accessible to the public because they haven't restored everything yet but it seems like they are consistently working on it and opening more locations all the time. I do wish they would move some of the railings, which they use to keep people away from the artifacts, back a few feet so you could see the thrones a little better and get better pictures inside some of the buildings. Some of the buildings are also closed off completely but you can see through the windows what it would've looked like all those years ago, they just need to clean the glass a little more often. Overall this was a great stop and I'm thankful that we came here.

This has a lot of Chinese history held within these walls. It's about 10 USD(60 Yuan) per person to visit so it is definitely worth the money. ID is required to enter so either have your passport on you or a US Driver's license worked for me. This location is closed on Monday so keep that in mind when planning your trip. Plenty of shops in here for food/snacks/water/trinkets. The earlier in the day you go the better as this place definitely fills up with many many people trying to visit and paying respect to the grounds."
"While the history is fascinating, this vast complex is a bit bleak. Visitors cannot enter the buildings and the crowds are immense. Our guide kept us there for nearly three hours and it was too long."
We went there on a Thursday morning. Please come early to be able to really enjoy the site. The place was started to be build 1400 years BC ! Every emperor has contributed and extended the site a bit with stories or the own eara.
"Reminds me of the Hermitage under the Soviets, anything of value had been pilfered and stolen by party members a long time ago, very little left, the architecture is interesting, but if you have seen Chinese architecture, you have seen this, the scale is large, but in reality nothing special. The Emperor lived in opulence, but there is nothing of that left other than the buildings. You can blame this on the communist thieves that took everything. It also doesn't help that there is a HUGE portrait of that murderer Mao right on the front of the city."
This is the huge place with many buildings inside. We had a guide to explain the building. It was take about 3 hours to walk. So i recommend to wear comfortable shoes:) . The ticket is little bit expensive but you'll get amazing experiences!
"Just brilliant, amazing to see in person and so much to see and do. Would definitely recommend to anyone going."
"You can just feel the history, we walked through and had a great explanation from out tour guide. It was very crowded but that didn’t distract from the grandeur and history of this Palace"
"These huge palace grounds are very well maintained, but get crowded! There is minimal signage, so get an audioguide(I did not try this one) or a detailed map to find the various rooms."
"Allow yourself at least 3 to 4 hours to see this place properly. There are so many buildings to see, the gardens and pieces of art work and sculptures that are in the place are amazing. There is plenty of toilets and places to get food and drink when inside. Cant get over the cost to enter tourist attractions in China they are so cheap."
"It was cold during our visit but we had a beautiful blue sky days. Cold month but less tourists both local and international. Not as busy as it looks from the photos. Great space and well facilitated with the shops and restrooms. Well, I’m impressed with the star rating at the toilets. Very very clean and offering both Asian and Western styles. Many places are accessible. It is Ok to get in and browse around with wheelchairs. Prepare to walk at least for 2 hours as you will get in at one side and out at the other. Depends on how much you need to follow the stories and history of the place. Look around and see the details of the building structures. Grand and big. Highly recommended!"
"This is a huge city of temples. They are beautiful looking and it is amazing the history of how this city was made and how it was used. Each temple being used for a different reason. However, it is annoying that you cannot go inside any of them and after looking at the outside, eventually they all start to look alike and I was actually looking forward to coming to the end of it. Very busy."
"After the chaos and confusion of trying to make sense of where to get the tickets from - you enter the Forbidden City only to find yourself impressed by all the wonderful sights and glimpses into the history and life of those who lived or worked here. Beautifully maintained and restored. Although it is busy, you can find some really quiet and peaceful areas for solitude and reflection. the gift shops are great and there is no pressure selling. A great way to acquire a depth of knowledge of one aspect of Chinese history. Spend at least 3-4 hours if you can."
We were in Beijing for 3 nights and no one informed us that the forbidden city was closed.. beware ... although you could walk around the outside you were not allowed to go in ..
IT IS BEST IF YOU WALK THROUGH THE ENTIRE STRETCH.. Please keep in mind that you have separate gates for entry and exit..There are very good views both natural as well man made
If you are in Beijing you must visit the forbidden city. I would allow a minimum of 3 hours and use the services of a local guide if possible to explain the history and heritage of the palace. The size and scale has to be seen to appreciate the history.
"The place is vast and there is much to take in, we had a guide with us who explained the symbolism of all the buildings, animals and colours. The beliefs behind the history and layout of the Forbidden Palace are fascinating.You could spend a whole day here."
Must see while in Beijing. The place goes on and on and on. Really enjoyed our time in the Forbidden City.
The crowds were enormous... ugh. Interesting and worth the visit. Just don't expect pictures without a crowd.
"If you are not a fan like me of the museum or historical places, then take your pictures at the entrance and save your money everything else looks almost the same inside, but if do like history then go inside and buy one of those pieces of equipment that will basically tell you the story of the forbidden city."
"Make sure you have some comfortable shoes on, just walking from one end to the other is a long haul. It's amazing what the chinese people were require to do for their country"
It's incredible to stand in the Forbidden City and think about all the dynasties of rulers that lived and worked there. I was especially glad to have a guide to help us navigate and explain various aspects of the site and key features.
"A wonderful expose of the one place I have always wanted to visit. A neccesary counterpart to the film of ""The last Emperor""."
Seen a lot of tv about this place but the actual city and it’s buildings was way better than I had expected. Granted a lot of work has been done and more could be done too but the decoration was stunning and the scale of everything amazing. It is very popular so you won’t be by yourself but if you have a particular spot in mind for that special photo just ease your way in and the person in front will soon finish their selfie and move on. The detailing deserves a telephoto lens if you have one but mostly you will be using a wide angle to fit in everything and hovering your finger over the shutter button while you wait for the right view to open up.
This is a must visit if you in Beijing . I was there once now it cost money 😂 and have longer lines but still it is great place to visit and interesting . Don’t plan to be there a lot because it is amazing but still repeating itself in a way . Still amazing culture and really unique people.
Very ornate. You really need to go through with a guide to understand the significence of this cultural tourist attraction.
"Not only the symmetrical plan is amazing, head up for the 2500 years-old disaster-resistant structures with interlocking flower-shaped brackets called “dougong” that reduce the impact of earthquakes on buildings. No nails not glue!"
"This is the largest palace in the world and holds significant historical value to the Chinese-however-it was only a so-so. A lot of walking and a lot of empty space. Don't get me wrong-I am glad that we went, it was an inexpensive entrance fee as far as attractions go but it did't hold a wow factor. We enjoyed the park behind it more.

Expect to see crowds-was part of the fun for us."
My wife and I recently visited here and we were expecting to be able to see much more especially inside some of the buildings .Still it was interesting not not overwhelming.
"This complex is huge and not very handicap friendly. So many people close to the buildings it’s hard to get pictures without lots of them in it! You can’t actually go in any of the historical buildings as they are blocked off. The dowager empress garden area is nice as are the gardens as you exit. Once you enter the city you must walk all the way through to exit, one way in and out. I used the restrooms here and there was a mix of western toilets and squat pits however be warned no toilet paper!"
"A must see in Beijing but we preferred the summer palace. Get there for 8:30 and join the hordes who file through the gates. It is HUGE so you need 4-5 hrs. Audio guide is good and make sure you go to the clock hall at 11:00 for the demo, this was a real highlight. So much to see and take in, it is gargantuan and gets a bit samey. Overall it is worth it but it felt a bit cold and uninviting."
"I knew it was big, but it's ENORMOUS. It is also very beautiful. Go in the afternoon to avoid the crowds."
"At the heart of Beijing, this is a large palace complex with an interesting history and architectural style. Plan on about 2-3 hours once inside. To get there, you have to go through security near the front of the palace (where Mao's portrait is). That took about 40 minutes for us, but it gave us access to both Tiananmen Square and the Forbidden City. I would go through Tiananmen Square first, since after we exited the Forbidden City we had to go through security again to get to Tiananmen Square.

Once at the entrance, you'll need to pass through several large courtyards and find the ticket entrance for foreigners. It is to the left, right before the gated entrance to the Forbidden City. At this point you pay (40-60RMB), and they scan your passport, which enters it into their system. Then go to the turnstile entrance and show your passport again, and they let you through.

Once inside, you can purchase a self-paced audio guide (40 RMB). It didn't always work correctly, but it was still somewhat useful.

There is a lot to explore. Take your time walking around, exploring different places, and appreciated the scale of everything. There are several places to exit - at least one on the north side on one on the southeast side. It might make the most sense to just go south to north through the complex.

For some good background to the Forbidden City, I'd recommend watching the Last Emperor."
Make sure to hire a guide who has the historical knowledge to this huge assembly of palaces. We walked all the way from front to back since this is a one way tour and you cannot go backwards
"Absolutely awful, no paper tickets available from the ticket counter, with no other options available unless you have a data plan on your phone.
Not really good enough, only in Beijing for 2 days so haven't been able to see the Palace Museum at all. A major foreign tourist destination and no option apart from 'come back tomorrow'."
"Imperial Palace has many facets to it. Fascinating site that anyone should visit when you are in Beijing. Our tour guide Jimmy (WeiJun An) is very knowledgeable and personable. He knows his way around the Palace and showcase some other sites like the Emperor study house and clock museum. We enjoyed our visit and his company.

Vince and Jacqui"
"The Palace museum is incredible but if I were to visit again I would hire an actual guide as the audio guide is very poor and as it works with GPS it does have a lot of glitches. You should be able to find official guides witch are a bit more expensive than an audioguide but still fairly inexpensive,at the counter next to the Audio guide one. Arrive as early as possible in the morning and book tickets in advance through your hotel or Chinese friends as the official Palace museum website does not accept foreign credit card"
"To avoid the crowds, you can enter via donghuamen gate then take the trolley bus (2yuan per person) to the Meridien Gate to buy tickets and enter the Forbidden City. Buying online is a good option. You just need to show your passport to the person manning the entrance gate. Alternative route you could buy your tickets there. There wasn’t any queue to buy tickets in the early morning.

A must visit is the Treasure Gallery where you can see the Dragon Screen and Zhenfei’s well. Tickets must be purchased separately for entrance to the Treasure Gallery.

Before leaving, you must take a walk along the top of the City Wall to see the Turret and rooftops of the many palaces within the Forbidden City."
"The forbidden city is great. The museum inside the city was a good look. Lots of old artifacts, you can see the Emperors throne. Probably a bit boring for kids tho"
If you can stay in the Wangfujing area you can save a lot of money on tours and just walk to the Forbidden City and take a short subway to Temple of Heaven
"As in most attractions, be prepared to WALK. Wear good shoes and take your time. The sculptures, architecture, and beauty of this site are not to be missed. Had the best cup of coffee in China here. As in a lot of places in China, credit cards are not accepted. Take enough cash with you. I am NOT a big shopper and in most countries have no difficulty using credit cards. China is not one of those. I was only able to use a credit card in 2 major hotels. Most stores and gift shop will not take them. There was a bride in a beautiful green dress walking through the passageways. She let us take pictures. Almost all women in China are very graceful and beautiful. I have always heard this and it is VERY true."
"So, this place is massive, and there are LOTS of people and tour groups.

There is a website that lets you buy your ticket in advance because they have recently capped daily visitation to 80k people.

I got there early in the morning, and didn't have a problem getting tickets.

The ticket booth for foreigners is quite a ways in and on the right just before the ticket takers and metal detectors. There is a sign that reads something like ""Ticket Exchange"".

For non-Chinese, you have to show your passport, and THAT serves as your ticket in once you've paid your 40 Yuan.

I would take snacks and drinks and make a full day of it. The place is massive, but it's pretty easy to navigate as traffic flows in one direction from south to north.

Many people don't bother going off east or west, which is where the nicer gardens and quiet spaces are.

I did not get an audio tour guide as my travel book gave me enough information, as did posted placards around the various sights.

Bring comfortable walking shoes!"
"Breathtaking place stepping back in time- you forget you’re in Beijing. Foreigners, do not be fooled by people on the street! The one and only way to get in is through Tiananmen Square. Also be wary of people trying to sell you ticket saying there’s no office. There is a ticket office specifically for foreigners."
I went on a tour in the AM. Way too busy. If I went back I would go in the afternoon. Plan to spend at least a few hours.
"For those who are travelling independently or without a tour guide we planned a splendid day under our own steam covering off (in order) Chairman Mao’s Mausoleum, the Yengyangyu Tower Gateway, Tian’anmen Square and of course the Imperial Palace. First of all get your hotel to order online your tickets for the Imperial Palace for the day and take the printed off confirmation with you. Gives you peace of mind that you are guaranteed to get in as the tickets are limited (all 80,000 of them!). Got the subway south of Tian’anmen Sq and worked our way northwards. Subway Station being Qiamen. Exit A out of action so follow everyone else out of Exit B. Then a tedious circular route to cross the main road. Involved queue for ID check and then a little further on another mass queue (20 minutes) for security check. You emerge on the eastern side of the Sq. Immediately right is the Beijing Tourist Information (left across the road is Mao’s Mausoleum). Not so obvious is the Tourist Information acts a a bag or locker service (do not leave any valuables). You have to deposit any bags before you enter the Mausoleum. So then cross the road and join the Mao queue- and feel smug when you see everyone being turned away who has a bag! The line was pretty quick (and this being a Saturday too). You enter the Mausoleum reverentially and pay your respects. Mao looking pretty tangerine in colour...Then exit on the south side and right in front of you is Yengyangyu Gate -one of the primary gateways into the Sq. Worth paying the ¥20 for the first floor view across the Sq north and the exhibition inside ( and toilet! These seem pretty scant on the ground in the Sq but are abundant everywhere else in Beijing). Then exit and pick up your bag - which shuts at midday and it’s not open in the afternoon nor is the Mausoleum. Now you are free to tackle the rest of the Sq and the amazing highlights of the Imperial Palace. On the ground tickets are at the far north east end just before you go through the bag security area (having walked through several courtyards first) or if you have your online printed off reservation just flash this with your passport as you go through security (no need to pick up tickets as earlier reviews seem to suggest) and you are through. Enjoy!"
"Amazing! Huge number of visitors every day, but worth it! There are many good traditional restaurants to treat yourself after a long day visit."
"The Forbidden City was amazing to see in person. The architecture and detail are absolutely beautiful. You can arrange a tour ahead of time or find one of the many tour guides inside of the complex.

Be aware: they only sell 80,000 tickets a day and they sell out almost every day. You will need your passport to get through security and to get your ticket. Expect crowds. It was absolutely packed when I went and I was there in the down season. It was also tricky to find the exit. Do not try to go out through the main entrance because it is one way."
Amazing and beautiful The city has several layers of security involved to prevent being attacked. Many doors into different parts of the city all of which are significant to the importance of the person visiting the city.
"We went there twice in our 8 days trip to Beijing. It was the first place we went to when we arrived, and we went in the afternoon. The crowd was not too bad, compared to the second time we went in the morning. Morning is very crowded with tour groups.

I would advise you to get the sound guides. We have read quite a few reviews on how the sound guides gps were a bit wonky - but they worked fine for us. I much preferred my own walk around trip rather than the second time we went with a guide. With the guide we spent about 1.5 hours in Forbidden City, it was a direct route through. Whereas when we did our own walk inside, we could rest for drinks, and explored other rooms that are on exhibition.

We spent about 4 hours in the forbidden city on our own, and we still couldn't cover everything as they close at about 5.30 i think.

It is amazing and i would go back again!

I was fiddling with some apps recently and realised they do have a sound guide on the apps as well - do consider downloading those and read up before you go so it makes sense to you what you are reading!"
"I visited this place as part of a day walking tour and I am glad I did so. There are many temples insides and to me even with the guide, many just looked the same :) Without her, I think I would have been walking around aimless :) However it was interesting to hear the reasons why each one was built and for what purpose-for example-1 was built for the Empress to celebrate her birthday each year! Be prepared to have to stand your ground for pictures, inside the temples, there are artifacts and because of the amount of people trying to get pics, they will push and shove to try and get them. I just focused on the outside of the building, left the pushing and shoving to others :) Passport is needed to go inside so don’t forget to bring it if visiting. Well worth a visit!"
"We were in mid-March, still winter, and not so crowded as our guide explained, compared to summer months. Walking to this place with all the sceneries along the way was awesome. When we reached the gate, a queue was just starting, so we were able to go in and enjoy the beauty of the palace, the sceneries etc. Our guide was indeed knowledgeable on its history. Good to have good pair of comfortable shoes as there’s a lot of walking to be done. There is also a hill for the more energetic visitors to walk up to enjoy the view from there. You can take pictures and selfies here, and good thing was that tourists know how long to stay on for pictures before moving on to the next scenery, making way for other tourists. A must visit place when you’re in Beijing."
If you don't get here you've missed one of the most important parts of China. An absolute must see. Could go many times and still have more to visit.
These days in China all you see are huge tall skyscrapers! Very little of the traditional houses remain. The Forbidden City is a beautiful reminder of days gone by! Well worth the time it takes to get into this area! A must see when you are in Beijing!
"Certainly, there was a lot of walking from the southern gate to the northern gate. The first impressive building was the grand Hall of Harmony, where the court sessions were held. Thereafter, especially the inner palace section, one can only peak inside and it was musty at best.

Learnt why my father’s favourite number is nine;). It was an important ‘harmonious’ number and huge doors were embellished with 9 x 9 studs.

The scale is huge and young children may get tired and bored. Fortunately, there were ice cream concessions along the tour, which helped.

Tiennamen Square was a short stop before our Forbidden Palace tour. Aside from the associated historical events, it is simply a huge square."
It is a huge vast labirant palace including many rooms and saloons designed for living the empror. Most of it has been built with wood and some part has been coverd by gold but there is no way to entering the saloons and all of them is forbidon yet!
"Very crowded place. In here must minimum spend 4-5hours. You can get a local tour guide or rent a translator machine to understand the history of this building.
This a must visit place in Beijing. Must self prepare a good shoes to walk."
"If you like History and Chinese culture, you will need to visit this place.Be prepared to walk long distances. Best to go with a guide who can explain the differences in each building and point out important detail"
"We were impressed by the size and grandeur of this complex. It required a lot of walking. While we visited in a March which is considered low season, because it was a Sunday (it was closed on Mondays being a museum) we felt it was crowded.

We did not pre-book our tickets. We just went to the ticket windows with our passports. We showed our passports and paid 100 yuan (US$16.00) and the lady handed our passports back to us telling us that our passports were our tickets.

We queued at 1:00 p.m under the hot sun. There was no cover/roof at the ticket counters. And a local even tried to cut into our line. I stopped him from doing that by extending out my right and left elbows, hands on my hips.

Watch out for uneven pavement. There were deep crevaces in between cobbled stones.

And watch out for yellow globs of pleghm on the pavement."
A must see site for Beijing. A lot larger than I had expected and lots of walking which is tiring for young children. There is a food stall/shop onsite selling a few items but suggest if going around lunch then to take own lunch in. There’s plenty of places to sit and eat within the palace.
The Forbidden City is a long walk through that reminds one of greatness and defeat all in one space....so beautiful preserved ..next to Tian'anmen Square
Best thing about this part of the tour is that Intertrips gets you by all the crowds which avoids hours of waiting. The Forbidden City is a must see but about four miles of walking all totaled.
"My husband & I flew for a couple of days to Beijing on our trip for Shanghai, we wanted to have the highlights in a more private way and this tour was perfect! And our tour guide Angie was THE best. Explain every single detail and speaks a perfect English which was important for us since we don’t speak Mandarin. You won’t regret taking this tour, the Forbidden City is beautiful and big, beautiful details and Angie help us navigate it perfectly.

PROS of visiting this time of the year, is not a high season, so there is no to much people so you can walk around and take your time. CONS is super cold! Winter is really hard in Beijing so bring warm clothes if you want to enjoy the walk around.

After the visit to the Forbidden City, Angie took us on shopping to several places until she drop us back safely at the hotel."
"We (parents with 2 teenagers) loved the grandeur and history of this place! It's unbelievable the effort, time, and $ that went into the Emperor's living space. As you go through each large entrance from one building to the next, you get the feeling of Deja Vue, as they are all so similar in style. That being said, it is something you don't want to miss!"
"Impressive huge palace that comprises of three main segments: the management/meeting area, the resting/emperors Room section and then the last section is the garden. You would need a lot of walking at uneven flooring. The details of the interior and the exterior and to forget about the small little “animals” monuments on top of all of the building is amazing an has significance meaning behind it. Do expect huge crowd at all times and hence Pre purchase ticket is advisable to avoid long que. Do allocate at least 2-3 hours and enter the palace before 3pm for good coverage of the palace."
"An amazing place to visit. The building were amazing and lots to walk around and see. The ticketing system was fairly easy once we found the passport window at the fair end. The crowds were unbelievable on the Tuesday we went, absolutely jammed however once in (and there was definitely a stampede getting in) it settled down and allowed you to explore."
It was amazing to see. The whole place was beautiful. But for anyone who has problem walking there was a lot of walking involved with not many places to sit down.
"Seriously, if you do one thing in your 144 hours in China this has to be it. If you have more time, well good for you, you can do a lot more. But this still has to be the bestest ever.

Every gate I went through I was like “Oh my God I’m in the Forbidden City!” And our guide would be like “No, no you’re not even in the Forbidden City part yet.” There are non forbidden parts, that’s how big it is.

It is definitely crowded, although in the vastness of the space it doesn’t seem so bad. People will definitely take pictures of you or your 6’3 husband."
"It is hard to comprehend the vastness of the Forbidden City. The decorations on the buildings are smaxing, as are the carved stone steps.
The court if the Dragon Lady provided a more peaceful intetlude.
An obvious must see in Beijing."
"We traveled to the palace alone and not with an organised tour, when we came out of the tube station a Chinese guide spoke with us, Han who charged 200 rmd pp and what a guide he was! He took all through the palace stayed with us for most of the day and pointed us in the right direction for authentic food. The Palace is a must see, the architecture and opulence of those long ago times."
Seeing pictures of Forbidden City are nothing compared to seeing it in person - we could have easily spent more time here as this place is enormous - but we were with a tour group - a must do
This is another must see in Beijing. The palace goes on forever and it is a lot to take in. Not a lot to see in the palaces themselves as far as we could tell but the overall expanse of palaces is quite impressive to see.
"The size and breadth of this site are amazing. The insight into Chinese culture and life were beyond our expectations. This huge complex with all of it's components is mind boggling. As with most sites in China, watch your step it isn't easy walking."
"Walk through history.It is a lot of walking, but on a cool day in March it was exhilarating. Worth every penny to get in. Be prepared for crowds and tours. I especially enjoyed the gardens."
"You can easily go by subway. Tickets available on the spot through wechat by scanning the code. But online registration only in Chinese. 40rmb entrance fee. ID or passport needed.
Take your time for the visit, it's huge!
Audioguide recommended....."
Lots of walking. The place is Hugh. Crowded but ok. A picture of the past. The largest existing palace. Worth the money and time. Get the audio guide.
I went early morning and it was ridiculously crowded. Do your research and find a better time to go there! Also take water and pre book your tickets online so much easier as you just have to present your passport.
"Structurally, the forbidden city is impressive- it’s massive. We went on a Sunday - bad move, very crowded. There isn’t much in the way of signs or explanations anywhere in the grounds and the electronic guide I hired was faulty at best. I love my history, some might say im a nerd, but after spending two hours here it didn’t grab my attention. Maybe my expectations of the forbidden city were too high, but it never felt more than a large expanse of similar looking temples and concrete grounds. My advise- avoid weekends, do research beforehand and avoid the electronic guides, then it’s worth it. Enjoy!"
"but this place gets CROWDED, even at 8.45am. The main crowd seems to walk through the forbidden city straight through, there are quieter areas in the less-visited side areas of the site."
My friend and I visited last autumn. It was not what we expected. Every single gate you walk through is exactly the same. We planned to spend 2-3 hours but half an hour was enough.
"Worth visiting when in the city but...... It really is a huge place and it felt very crowded. I was often pushed and shoved when talking a look inside the buildings, and there are many domestic tourists who do not seem to appreciate personal space in the same way I do! (We went on a wet, cold and snowy Saturday, but people were not put off by the weather). There is very little information about all the different buildings, which was a little frustrating and after a short while they all began to look the same..... If I were to go again, I would try and get a guide book, or hire a tour guide to really get the most out of it.
Also worth noting that we needed to queue for a security check, even at 8.30 in the morning, and this took over 30 minutes."
Our first day in China Beijing and our second stop was the forbidden city! This is the place to visit. However understand you will never see it all. It’s huge! Rich in history. Beautiful in color and architecture. You could wander these grounds for hours. Make sure to have a guide do that you can learn as much as possible.
"We visited Forbidden Palace with my collegue and the visit was not what I excepted. We wanted to see this landmark and take pictures of that, but instead people wanted to take pictures of us and/or pictures us with them. I would say about 25-30 people wanted to do that. It was fun at first but not after a while. Well its China, like people like to say"
"Its huge and takes up half a day if u really want to see it. At times it gets boring if u r traveling alone!
Considering it was made in 1400, its a great place to see how forward thinking the chinese have been."
We did the Forbidden City and Tianamen Square as part of a tour which was great as we missed all the queues for security checks etc. It was a very fascinating place to visit. It has lots of places inside to look at so take your time and enjoy.
"This is a must see in Beijing. A city within a city. Built about 600 years ago and 20+ emperors of Ming and Qing lives here! In here, you will pass through 9999.5 rooms.... very rich in history and simply breathtaking.

This place can become extremely crowded so make sure you are ready for it."
"Great place to visit very big place you will not do this all in one day, lots of little squares and gardens going off in all directions, fascinating place"
"I went to forbidden city couple of times, it is very huge and whenever I will visit way always forget to the end point. It is very nice to place and must visit historical place in Beijing."
I would recommend making this part of a day-long tour of Beijing. There is a lot of history in the buildings. From the high points you also get a good view of some of the city.
"I had a great experience at Forbidden City in Beijing, China. There are so much to see and experience, and you feel like you transport back thousands of years."
Take your time to wander through the Forbidden City and pretend you are the Emperor. Make sure to check out the park.
"Be prepared to walk a lot, because we didn't. We rushed down to the Forbidden City without eating breakfast because we had to get into the Museum before 12 noon, and I completely regret it. Buying food in the museum? Food inside was extremely disgusting and tasted awful, even though it was really expensive. I ordered a harmless looking spaghetti but it was just a heavy plate of noodles with normal-looking spaghetti sauce that cost me about SGD$7-8. It tasted nasty. Ew.
The place is really one to behold. Especially since I am Chinese, I couldn't help but feel extremely connected to the place that was so enriched with Chinese history and culture. I've watched historical Korean and Caucasian dramas, and I often felt a sense of misplaced identity since the Chinese historical dramas and history are not as mainstream. So it felt really good to be in the same position where so much of the history of my own ethnicity took place. It really is a place to feel pride for being Chinese, especially since so many foreigners, namely Americans, French, Thais and Koreans took in as much astonishment and wonder as I did while visiting this very historic and important place.
The Museum was really captivating and successfully served to withhold my interest in historical Chinese royalty and the Qing dynasty. At the entrance you are allowed to borrow an electronic guide for a small fee where for every area you pass through, the guide will activate to give you deeper understanding and context of the significance of the said area. Already when the guide activated at the Meridian Gate, or Wumen, it was fascinating to know that the gate I passed through was the same gate that the Empress of Imperial China could only go through once in her lifetime on her wedding day! Meaning that I could walk through the gate as many times as I wanted to, so I technically wielded more power than the Imperial Empress! It's really little things like these that really make the trip worth it, and I really would want to bring my children here one day, like my father did when he brought me here decades after he came here for the first time. You get to see the room of infamous Empress Dowager Cixi, still in tact! The significance of that is amazing, knowing how she was such a well-known figure in Chinese Imperial history and that she spent a significant portion of her life here.
There was a lot of great souvenirs to buy, and my mother bought cute Emperor/Empress/Prince/Princess dolls, but I did not understand why they did not sell fridge magnets, or at least I didn't find any. My family has a collection of fridge magnets from all the countries and places we have been to, so it was weird why they did not use fridge magnets as merchandise, especially since all the other places we have been to, like Temple of Heaven, the Great Wall, all had fantastic magnets we bought as souvenirs. Also, I did not really enjoy the exhibits. The Hall Of Clocks was an absolute bore, not to mention that it took place in such a dim building.
While I did not like the food, my other grievance with the Museum was how tiring and long it takes to move through the whole attraction. While it was mid-march and it was a little cold, which was ideal weather for the visit, I would have preferred if the place had modernize a little by renting out scooters, hoverboards or segways. Especially since it was pressurizing to cover the entire place within a day. There are many chairs all over the area to let people sit, since it is tiring to walk everywhere.
Overall, I loved the place. So much history, so much significance, so much culture! But honestly, the food and the intense amount of walking really put me off."
"China is a very complex country and today we have a vision that certainly doesn’t fit with its great and glorious past. The Forbidden City is the “manifesto” of this great empire, its attention to art, the beautiful things and the quality of life of those who lived there centuries ago. The magnificence of this palace-city doesn’t remain much but only architecture, the pavilions that retrace the history of the various dynasties that have followed. The buildings are beautiful although not perfectly maintained. The visit mainly takes place wandering along the avenues between a pavilion and the other and if you like details here you’ll find plenty to discover: on the roofs of the pagodas, the inlays of the columns, paintings on wood and amazing jewels and utensils. The most impressive room is certainly “the throne” even if most of the furnishings have been lost or are kept in the Beijing museum. Even if it's worth it, prepare to make a long line for the ticket office or book them on the internet. I recommend taking a guided tour so you can discover many details about this fascinating place. Visit time is about 3-4 hours. The price is
40-60 yuan (5-8€) but I suggest you to buy the cumulative tickets for visit forbidden city + temple of heaven + summer palace.

"Having seen Forbidden City on countless movies, TV shows, etc., I thought I was well prepared for what we'd see. I wasn't. The size of MANY things in Beijing is beyond the pale. Your first impression, walking through the gate, will be ""Wow - look at that Great Hall""; then you hike up to it, see the 'chair' (as our Chinese guide referred to the throne within) and pass through to the other side. It's then that you realize there are FOUR more, massively equidistant Halls beyond it (not to mention the concubine area, the garden, etc.). Prepare to walk - and be staggered! While the 'chairs' and the one bed are not really much to see, the history behind it is dramatic and fascinating (make sure you take a guide!). One caveat: we were there in early March - and nearly froze! It's windswept and can be VERY cold. Bundle up if you're there in the winter!"
"Wow this place is amazing. After waiting with massive crowds to get into the forbidden city, it was a marathon to walk through it. It took us approximately four hours to go through all the temples and housing places with the explanation from our tour guide. It is a place I would not go unless we have a tour guide or a self-directed tour of some kind. It is a lot of walking and will totally tire you out."
"Thoroughly enjoyed our trip to the forbidden city, it was fascinating and we liked the atmosphere. Make sure you take your passport though!"
"You cannot go to Beijing and not go to the Forbidden City. It is very crowded, regardless of the weather.

It is a pleasant walk through the gates and you can only look into the various building."
We spent a few hours in the Forbidden City. You could easily spend all day or multiple days to see it all. We had a private guide which was helpful.
Our family visited the Forbidden City on a private tour. This is a must see in Beijing and our tour guide provided so much history on the Ming and Qing dynasties. You cannot imagine how grand and how enormous this place is. Put on your walking shoes.
"It was the first time I visited a Palace complex (though I have been to many palaces) and on one hand it gets quite repetitive, in the other they have thrown in quite a nice collection of exhibitions (don't miss the clocks) to keep the interest high."
"The size of this attraction is truly inspiring. It was almost like a Russian doll experience of huge gates opening onto great expanses with other huge gates at the other side which opened on to other huge expanses with huge gates at the other side which... Well, you get the picture. At only 30RMB for the visit (seniors get a slight discount), plus 10 RMB to see the Treasury (quite a lot of other good stuff in this section, so well worth the tiny bit extra), this is really good value for money. We went fairly early on a Sunday morning (8.30am) and there were already quite big queues. By lunch time, they were huge, so the earlier the better. We spent just over 3 hours there and could have spent longer. Loads to see. Recommended."
Visited the Forbidden City and Tiananmen Square. WOW! The palaces and museum go on forever and ever. All very intriguing and to think that huge complex was built for one family to occupy. The structures are very ornate and with colorful interiors. My one disappointment was that they all were extremely similar in design and structure. Saw one you saw them all except for the exquisite statues and ornaments inside each were different. Do not miss this attraction but expect to do a lot of walking.
The Forbidden City is an amazing place however there is not a lot to see once inside. The palace we were told were stripped by invaders. It is very difficult to get a ticket as it sells out the day before because of the crowds. So many local people hardly any tourists. Transport is hard to get close as they have blocked any easy access and you have a to walk a long way to get to the entrance. Once out of the City you can not hail a cab as they are not allowed to stop close by and you have to walk a long way back. probably a little disappointing.
The tour guide I was with rushed us trough the crowd within in an hour. I’m going back tomorrow for a better and slower look. The colour and buildings are fantastic. It is better to watch a few documentaries first to know what you are looking at because there are not any signs in English.
"This is just based on my friends who have visited Beijing since I have lived here.

Everyone asks about the City and wants to visit, but the ones who have been enjoyed the view from Jinshang Park more than entering the city itself. They say it gets repetitive, and if they aren't too interested in the history of the City itself, they just stay for the picture and get out."
"The place is very huge and crowded. If you go to the West or East wing, there will be a shuttle (5 RMB/pax) to escort you to the main gate. Here you will have to buy tickets, and you can rent an automatic guide to accompany you throughout your tour in Forbidden city (I go there with a local guide though, so I don't rent it, but I saw lots of tourist are renting them). There is also baggage storage available by the main gate. They will check your ID or passport so please prepare them.
Once you passed the main gate, You need to walk for around 2 km to reach the exit door. You can pretty much explore anywhere as long as its not blocked or locked. There are many resting areas available, so if you are touring with elderly you can rest assured. My favorite part is the imperial garden near the exit gate. The garden is beautiful with very big and old trees that looks so mystical. It is a very nice photo spots."
"From the outside, you can already say that it's very big, but then you pass the huge red doors and all your assumptions fly out the window. The place is HUMONGOUS! Like 10x my estimate. And for it to be so well-maintained says a lot for its caretakers. I mean I can't imagine how much effort is needed to maintain a place of such size. The antiques there are so beautiful and in very good condition. I love that their history is well-loved enough to be preserved with this much care."
Our guide provided great information regarding the history of the city. Beautiful architecture and garden.
"This is a really big place. If you want to get to visit all the small museums inside of it, you should spend half a day on it.

-Use really nice and confortable shoes.
-If you are a student ask for special entrance tariff.
-Get mentally prepared to visit the mist visited museum in the world (even more than the Louvre, and believe me I’ve been in both places and this one is way more crowded)

But in my opinion, IS WORTH IT. Have you seen Mulan? If you have you gonna love it! It’s simply MAJESTIC and imposing:)"
"This place is huge ! Don’t be worried by the large crowds at the entrance as the forbidden city really opens up inside. The signage was great and really lets you learn about the city.
Bring comfy shoes and your passport (it will be your entrance ticket)"
If you go to Beijing this is a must make sure you have a good guide and have good shoes it’s a once in a lifetime must do
The forbidden city was nice although i find that you have to crawl over ppl just to see tge good things the audio book reccomends. There is a nice painting shop with a very friendly man on the right side of the palace
Well worth a trip to so how it used to be. We didn’t have to queue to get in and you could easily get to be on your own due to the sheer size of the place. Make sure to take your camera and a fully charged battery
The forbidden city is pretty big and there is a lot to see. My camera charger didn't work so half way through my camera died but I still ended up getting some great pictures.
The Forbidden City is really a one of a kind place that has over 3000 buildings surrounded by walls and moats. Even after walking for about 2 hours we only seen a small portion of what is there. Lots of history to learn about here
"My wife & I visited as part of a tour group of 28 in November. The lines at entry were not long. Security in place, but not over-done.
We were here for around 5hrs, and could easily have used the full day.
I suggest a guide to help explain the various buildings & their uses, as well as the meaning of the various icons placed around them.
This is a must-do in China, and well worth the walk."
Make sure to arrive early as even on a quiet day the line can take 1-2 hours. Access to the Forbidden City is through Tiananmen Square. Foreigners can buy tickets at a window to the right when looking at the main entrance to the City. Bring your passport and lunch/snacks as dining options are limited inside. Budget at least half a day for the line and visit as it is huge and worth taking the time to explore it leisurely.
"This is probably my #3 ""must see"" item in Beijing (Great Wall and Summer Palace being 1 and 2). It's huge and impressive in size, but lacks much of interest beyond its big walls. Apparently the royals spent more time at the Summer Palace. The crowds are bad. Go early. Tiananmen Square is next to it, but don't talk about it while there; be discreet."
"We went last autumn and the weather was very nice, no sog, no rain, not too cold, not lines. It was amazing. It is a good ida to hire a guide, BUT beware, because many of them approaches you with unreal prices and a pushiness close to rudeness. We finally hired a young man, named Tony, and paid close to 20 dollars including a very well earned tip. I think it is a must to hire a guide, Tony showed us the special places and palaces, since the forbidden city is too big to try to visit it entirely. he told us about the carved streets, the colors of the ceilings and the many details that can be easily bypass. I strongly suggest to watch the movie ""The last emperor"" before of after your visit, that will give you a weird feeling of reality. Amazing place, but I guess visiting it on summer must be awful."
"Like in many cities abroad, at first I was bummed to be led around by a guide...but upon arrival I was ecstatic to be led past hundreds of people in long lines for security scan and then for tickets.
We walked right past everyone and as a result, got to see so much more.

Wear FLAT shoes! The cobblestones and irregular sized steps and raised thick thresholds made for a challenge for this osteoarthritic 52 year old! I'm 5'1"", 158# and logged 13,000+ steps!"
"Yet another example of amazing architecture. A vast expanse of Palace buildings. A hat and water is needed in hot weather. A definite ""Must See"" when visiting Beijing."
"Had a guide for a small group of people, which was much better than a large group following a flag.

We were rushed through different gates meaning we didnt have to line up for most things and waved through security

This place is magnificent if the sheer size alone doesnt get you. But the detail on the buildings is so intricate it is easy to miss!

It wasn't freezing cold but the wind has a chill so bring a scarf and gloves if you are afraid of the cold"
"I have made this trip many times before and every time there is something new to sea ,the temple is great and you are able to get a lot off souvenirs"
Forbidden city is very interesting place adjacent to Tiananmen square. This should be one of the items if you are planning for a day tour or brief visit to Beijing. It is in the heart of Beijing. Please plan for lot of walking!
"The day I went it was -11 Celsius but the cold wind made It feel colder! Bring hat and scarf and warm coat.

The forbidden city is wonderful , historic and well worth a visit. You could easily spend 4 hours there.

Remember not to forget your passport you need it to buy a ticket and gain entry .

There is a little gift shop on site and a small cafe.

I would recommend that you avail of the audio guide to get the most out of your time."
"Go to Beijing you clearly have to visit the Forbidden City. Very interesting of course and pays to get the translation earphone guides which are easy to use.
Top tip would be for those not fully familiar with the location when you get to back of the city don’t exit there but to turn back and go out the way you came in.
Can be crowded but the historic views and information make for a good experience.
Ticked the box of been there, done that so worth the visit."
"We went during new year celebrations. Not to be recommended as Chinese people are are on holiday and want to visit also. When we went we were 2 of possibly 200,000 people far too busy to do anything . I would say avoid Chinese new year to sightseeing the sights of Beijing"
"That is one of 3 must go sight in Beijing for me forbidden city , Great Wall and temple of haven . If you love planes as I do find a day to visit Chinese aviation museum. (Full day)
Let come back to forbidden city. They have a guide audio in English and other languages , that is a lot of important to understand the tour, you will see the history of the China from the beginning . And take a lot of nice pics.
Don’t be shy a lot of Chinese will ask you for a self pic , but you are not a pop star!
Se você está em Beijing não pode sair sem visitar a cidade proibida. Não deixe de comprar o guia de áudio interativo. Ajuda muito na visita. Eles têm mapas também além de ajudar são uma ótima lembrança.
Na minha opinião uma visita imperdível ."
"Amazing, simply amazing. I would recommend skipping Tiaanmen and coming through Zhongshanpark instead, but no matter what, if you are in Beijing you must see it. To get the grand scale of such a thing is hard to understand."
"It’s really huuuuuuuuge ; I did it a cold day , it was -3 and it was a windy day
My gad it was difficult; and I didn’t spend more than two hours
I think I saw the most important and had very nice photos even if they told me I need at least one or two days to finish it
Even if I had time I prefer spend it in summer palace rather than here"
"The Forbidden City can be a confusing place. Enter through the south gate, but you will have to exit through one of the other 3 gates (one for each direction). The lineup in the first courtyard with no English signs is for the Tiananmen tower (not worth the time in line or the extra cost or the hassle of checking your bag imo). You can get tickets for the Palace Museum ahead of time on the website or at the Passport office (NE corner of the second courtyard), but there are only 80,000 tickets per day so book ahead if you can. Your passport is your ticket, you don't get any kind of receipt or paper ticket. If you buy at the passport office the ticket is for that day, not possible to purchase there for a different day. If you don't get tickets go through the opening to the east and follow the road around to the exit. If you do get tickets stand in the next line to get in. The audio guide is 40 yuan and because it is GPS activated we had trouble getting it to start sometimes because you have to walk over the exact location, but the map on the back was helpful, in fact I would say some kind of map of the Forbidden City is essential. I would hire a guide next time so we don't waste as much time figuring out where to go. There are a few toilets inside and a couple places to buy food, but most people bring their own food. This is a BIG place and once you are in the only exit is at the north gate. There are lots of buses and taxis at the north gate if you don't want to walk any more."
"Was very crowded when we went there as it was during the annually meeting of the Chinese government officials and the extremely security checking had made us queued outside for about 3 hours...But is worth to pay a visit at least once in your lifetime, you don't tell anyone you have visited Beijing if you didn't come to this place. Amazing ancient Chinese palace construction you can't see it anywhere else."
The palace is vast and impressive. In my opinion it only serves as a symbol of how people are easy to manipulate with. The whole palace was built for just one man - the Emperor! And he forbid all others to enter. How brilliant. Do not be afraid of crowds. They will all get lost in the vastness of the palace. Entrance fee was only 40 Y per person (about 6 USD).
Beautiful place to see the past and Chinese grandeur of the emperors. The place gives a great idea of what China was in the past before it became Communist.
"I enjoyed this site. The massiveness is overwhelming as you travel through. I was amazed at the amount of people that visit. I went on a weekend so that tends to add to the crowd, but it was so many people that sometimes I thought I was going to lose my wife and friends who were with me."
"Great architecture, a lot of interesting items and buildings to see and a lot of history. Signs and audio guides are available in English, the latter in a large number of other languages as well, so you are actually able to get some additional information to what you see, which is unusual compared to other places I have visited in China so far.

The tricky part with this place is that they request that you buy your tickets online in advance, which requires a chinese phone number and bank account (or WeChat/Alipay). However, when we got there, it was no trouble buying tickets in a ticket window just to the right of the ticket check. Do note that before you get to this point you first need to pass the security check out by Tian’an men square, and pass through two of the gates."
"This would have been an unbelievable experience had the weather been warmer. It was freezing the day we went in February before the new year and we ran through which should have taken the better part of a day. We were not prepared for the cold weather and had not dressed appropriately so make sure you either do not go In February or if you do, dress for the occasion. We will definitely be back again."
"Well worth a visit, wear comfortable walking shoes as this place is enormous. Just a must place to visit when you are in beijing and most of the tour agency will bring you here."
"We didn’t get in because we were not in the first 80,000 people to show up. We didn’t feel too bad though because there had to be another 200,000 more Chinese who didn’t get in either.
It looks cool from the throngs outside and very large. Maybe we’ll see it next time."
"Duanmen, also known as the Gate of Uprightness, or Upright Gate is the 2nd gate from the southern end of the Forbidden City after the Gate of Heavenly Peace"
"Went there and was surprise how huge the palace is. There are many sections and rooms you can enter. Many historic stuffs and lots of history to read that I think my brain just got overloaded looking at it. You definitely need some time in this place if you are a history bluff. Place is crowded but this is China, what do you expect.
Tips: There is a park called Jingshan Park just opposite the end of the entrance, it is a short hike up to get the whole view of the forbidden city."
the place is amazing and its impossible to express everything through words. its a place where one has to visit atleast once in a lifetime
If you can buy your tickets in advance. Must show your passport when purchasing your tickets. I bought mine through the hotel consigner desk. The cost was 40 RMB. If you decide to walk you will have some security check points. The might ask you for your I D. Now mind you Tieneman square is right in front of the Forbidden City. I would suggest to arrive around 8:30am . There is a lot to cover. I would say it would take you at least 4 hours to view the grounds. I rented an English speaking with a built in GPS recorded MP3 PLAYER. IT EXPLAINED A LOT OF THE CULTURE AND HISTORY. YOU CAN GO AT YOUR OWN PACE. THE COST FOR THAT IS 40 RMB. NOW PAY ATTENTION TO WEAR YOU WILL BE EXITING SO THAT DO NOT GET LOST. DO NOT BUY EXPENSIVE SUVENER AT THE FORBIDDEN CITY. AS YOU EXIT THE FORBIDDEN CITY YOU WILL SEE STREET VENDORS... AND LITTLE SHOPS WITH SIMILAR MERCHANDISE. WEAR COMFORTABLE SHOES. YOU CAN BRING SNACKS AND DRINKS INSIDE. JUST NOT INSIDE THE PALACE.
"We arrived about an hour after opening and didn't have to queue for tickets as everyone had paid on their phone. Make sure you have your passport to get through security checks and to purchase a ticket. There were lots of tour groups who seemed to be speeding through the Forbidden City, straight down the middle seeing only the main sights. We walked around the edges of the courtyards where there was hardly anyone and had some sections completely to ourselves. Allow yourself enough time to see it properly - we spent just over 4 hours, and wear good walking shoes! Once you exit, pay the small fee to climb the hill in the park opposite and see the view back across the Forbidden City."
"Sadly when we went a large portion was closed off. However we still didn’t get to see everything. We only gave ourselves 3hrs here and foolishly thought that was enough. It is massive, opulent, and ornate. It’s no wonder the people eventually got fed up and over threw the emperor. Go and take your time and I recommend grabbing one of the multi lingual recorded self tours to get the most out of the experience."
"It’s pretty nice place, can see the architecture during the dynasty area. It’s was low season (winter) when I visited so not as crowded as it should be but still many people. Not much to see as no flowers and it’s quite dull tbh. But when peak season (spring or summer) they said it’s beautiful but be aware it will be crowded like crazy. If you like the to see and know about dynasty area then it’s worth to visit."
Visited the attraction in a hurry but still worth a visit. Can see all the ancient architecture and some artefacts and paintings at the venue. It’s a huge area to walk through. Lots of eateries and souvenir shops are setup within the premises. The miniature mountain and view point on top in the garden are amazing. The whole fort is surrounded by waterbody . Prepare to have a wechat Account and a mobile connection if planning to book your tickets by your own. Translators / virtual guides are available next to ticket counter which is good to avoid language barrier .
"Review by DrSim001 (Dr. H.C.M. Sim). Tourists Should Visit when in Beijing. Impressive palace. Background for the Movie ""The Last Emperor"", Beautiful architecture. The Palace showed how isolated the last emperor was. He was living in an ivory tower. Bring your own water. Wear walking shoes with good traction. Treasures are nice. However, many of the best treasures were taken from the Palace by Generalissimo Chiang Kai Shek and placed in the Taiwan National Museum. Visited the Palace Museum twice over the years. Regards DrSim001 (Dr H.C.M. Sim)"
"Cactus our guide was great! Very knowledgeable and made trip fascinating and fun. Also very sweet and nice, felt more like a friend sharing her country than paid guide.

Everything about Joe’s was professional and timely and reasonable price. Highly recommend this company and guide Ca tus"
"A visit to Beijing wouldn’t be complete without seeing the Forbidden City.

Make sure you leave enough time to see the site which is vast - you could easily spend a whole day inside wandering through the various rooms and viewing the treasures in display.

Fortunately, the Starbucks that they had allowed to trade inside the Forbidden City has now gone and has been replaced by a Chinese cafe. There are plenty of gift shops where you can buy a variety of FC memorabilia."
"This is a must while visiting Beijing, try to go early in the morning to avoid the crowds.

The whole visit takes half day so plan ahead. Its super interesting the history behind this place, to learn how they lived, the security they had, the responsibilities that came with each rank of the officers and family of the emperor. The architecture is beyond beautiful, they took care of every tiny detail, everything is hand carved and hand painted, worth taking the time to look at it carefully.

I recommend hiring a local guide, they know better about the history and you will learn on your own peace about each hall and rooms inside the Forbidden City.

Bring a camera with you, comfortable shoes and spare money for souvenirs and refreshers."
"The powwr of the previous dynastys can be felt here, a must visit if you are travelling to China. Visited March 2015"
"I loved the Forbidden City. The buildings are upkept beautifully and the signs are very informative. One issue I had though, was everything seemed very disorganized - there was no signs where to buy our tickets and there wasn't an exit near the entrance. There were also two security checkpoints, which seemed unnecessary."
"We probably visited the Forbidden City on the coldest day ever. But talking the cold out of it, it was a great experience. As a foreigner, we had to go to a separate area to get our tickets, but the staff directed us there with no issues.

Once inside I was surpised at how large it was. There were so many large open areas. There were lots of signs to tell you what things were for. There was also an audio tour but we didn't do it.

We got up top and did a walk along the wall part and that was pretty cool too.

This is worth seeing"
Brilliantly displayed items going back centuries which tell the tale of the growth and creation of China from the earliest dynasties and to anyone interested in history it is a fantastic experience to read about it from details in this museum rather than simply from a history book.
"hard for me to believe there is anything that would rival this tour stop anywhere! massive,sprawling complex, incredible architecture, and a chinese history lesson all around. this is without a doubt a can’t miss stop!"
"The Forbidden City-The Palace Museum was one of the highlights of our Beijing visit. I would strongly advise not to miss it.
Following reviews and guidebooks we visited just after opening time to avoid heavy crowds. Visiting in winter also helped avoid this.
As expected there is minimal signage in English, our first challenge was finding the ticket office. If you walk as far as you can until you reach the final security checkpoint before entering the Meridian Gate, the (passport required) ticket office is directly to the right of that. It is confusing as there were people queuing in many different areas but look before the Meridian Gate (to the right) you will find it.
As the crowds were growing, we visited all of the main buildings in the middle such as Hall of Supreme Harmony and Hall of Central Harmony etc straight up and then came back up and then down the outer buildings on the left and right sides of the central buildings. The crowds are most concentrated around the middle buildings so we found the outer buildings and courtyards more relaxed.
Also something not immediately obvious. Just to the right of the Meridian Gate once you enter the first courtyard (turn around and it’s behind you) is a set of stairs that take you up onto the wall and you can walk around to the East Flowery Gate. It was good to look around here once we returned to the Meridian Gate after visiting the central buildings.
Just my thoughts after visiting. It's worth checking out a map of the forbidden city before visiting or entering to have an idea of your plan of attack. Our slow visit with lots of pics took half a day."
The Forbidden City is a bucket list item in Beijing. I’d recommend taking a tour (I didn’t) to get some true insight. Make sure you have sufficient time as the premises is gigantic! And wear a hat! It can get pretty crowded so don’t lose your friends!!
"Excellent and the sheer size is overwhelming. Volume of people is beyond imagination, but disciplined as only the Chinese are. Mind boggling Architecture and a excellent walk to the Forbidden City."
The sheer size and scope of the Forbidden City was awe inspiring. We especially enjoyed the Clock Museum and the Nine Dragon Wall.
"The Forbidden City takes your breath away. I would say that you can easily spend half a day getting lost in the walkways, gardens, and gates of this magnificent historical site. The best reward is probably getting to the very end of the palace, where HUGE gates reveal a little man-made river and bridges along the palaces.

There are tons of little museums and shops along the way, as well as refreshment shops. I came during the peak of the Chinese National Holiday, so if I went through that, you can get through any kind of crowd that assembles here!

NOTE: GET HERE EARLY IF YOU'RE A TOURIST!!! Only 80,000 tickets are sold each day."
"This was a beautiful spot, we were lucky to have a nice day as well. I'd definitely recommend adding this to your stop."
"First of all, the place is incredibly beautiful and very interesting. I’d highly recommend a visit. Beware the scammers outside the gate. (They pretend to be teachers “practicing” English.) Bring water and an umbrella for shade, if possible. And most of all, I would strongly recommend a guide.

All that said, I feel compelled to mention the ONLY negative experience my family encountered in 5 weeks in China.

After walking around the site without a guide (a BIG mistake), we were very thirsty, so my 8-year-old daughter went to the gift shop to get a drink. (My daughter has long blonde hair, so she stands out in China.).

There was an employee selling drinks in the coffee and tea cafe near the exit. She was handing out bottled drinks from a cooler. My daughter approached the woman with money in her hand. For some reason, the woman continued to ignore my daughter, who was standing right in front of her.

It became apparent that the woman was ignoring my daughter, who ultimately came to me with tears in her eyes, saying “That the woman won’t give me a drink!” I went back to the cooler with my daughter, and the woman continued to hand drinks – literally over our shoulders – to other Chinese visitors.

I was initially perplexed, but I quickly became angry. I literally typed “Are we invisible?“ in my translator and held it out for her to read. She read the message, closed the cooler, and walked off.

Her behavior was clearly intentional.

Frankly, our experiences in China were incredible. The Chinese people were very friendly and welcoming. Admittedly, Beijing was not the friendliest city in China, but this woman’s behavior was exceptionally poor.

I’m not going to let this woman’s behavior change my perception of the Chinese people, but it did color my experience of the Forbidden City.

Next trip we’ll go to the Summer Palace instead."
"Really, if you are in China and you miss the Forbidden city then you are a fool.
What an incredible masterpiece of history this place is. The stories, the art, the architecture, the colours...it’s just wow. Head on up to the hill after for a great panoramic view of the city"
"Whenever I get to know a new city, I'm excited to wander on a Sunday afternoon to the city's biggest park or best attraction where families spend the day together.

The Forbidden City -Palace Museum was just the place on a cold January Sunday afternoon. There were lots of people, but it never felt overly crowded. Rather than join a tour, I got the audio tour thats available right before you go into the palace grounds.

After a while, I began to get temple bloat, they all begin to blend into the same thing, despite the fact that each one is unique and they are all cultural treasures of the world."
"We originally planned to come here on a Monday - note: Monday it is closed! You can also only enter on the Tiananmen Square side. It was a little confusing where to buy the tickets so it would be handy to have Forbidden City Entry written in Mandarin to ask around and avoid confusion. We chose the audio tour which starts as you enter different parts of the Forbidden City using GPS. This was very informative and extensive. Wear comfortable shoes as there is a LOT of walking involved. It was not overly crowded in October. Once you finish, remember to drop off your audio guide (to avoid a loud embarrassing alarm to alert that you didn't see the drop-off point). Directly across the road from the exit is a lovely park which has the only (I think) hill in Beijing city. This hill was created from the earth that was excavated during the construction. You can climb to the top which might be a little exhausting after going to the forbidden city (maybe leave it for a Monday). The gardens there are very nice and the view quite good."
"A magical place to visit - best visited with a guide to explain the rich culture. You can visit without a guide though and enjoy the splendor and the historical architecture, but with a guide you will get the depth of meaning to each part. Go in the Winter when the temperature is chilly (around 1degree) and the crowds are less, rather than in Summer when it can be +40 and busy.."
"The place is very big and easily will take couple of hours.

You can get the ticket on the right hand side of the entrance. The information is not clear on where to get the tickets. IF you are confused just go to the tourist information centre there. They will help you on the location to buy the ticket.

Worth the visit when you go to Beijing."
"Amazing experience traveling to Beijing last week and visiting the forbidden city. I went on a Saturday and it was busy but pleasant. I’m used to London but if crowds are not your thing, go early. Ticket is just 800 Yuen. Take your passport! The Palace of the Principle Emperor was my highlight. Do some research before you go so you know what you are looking at. Dates back the 12th century and was built by hand over centuries.
The gardens are beautiful too. In January it was COLD. I would visit in Spring if I had my chance again as it is all outside apart from escaping into the gift shops to warm up.
All together a must see! I will go again in the warmer weather at my next visit to Beijing."
"Walking 15 mins from Wangfujing Street. Forbidden City always crowded, many tourist in here especially if visit at public holiday or weekend."
"We spent the morning with a guide learning about the Forbidden City. I'm sure you could stay longer, but I felt like we got a good overview and got to see everything. After awhile, the buildings all start to look the same. You don't need a guild, but I would have a book or something to let you know some of the history, so you know what you are looking at. The grounds were beautiful and we enjoyed our morning here."
The biggest palace in the world. The palace exemplifies traditional Chinese architecture. The Forbidden City was declared a WHS and is listed by UNESCO --> absolutely must be!
"The forbidden city is a must when going to Beijing, but I wouldn't recommend spending loads of time here, there are better things to see in Beijing such as the summer palace or the Great Wall."
I visited the Forbidden City a few years ago and due to a rushed schedule did not hire a guide. What a mistake. When I was recently in Beijing I made sure to hire a guide and it made a huge difference. The guide enhanced the experience and made the visit much more interesting.
"Our guide was excellent spoke great English.

Had a good overview given and walked round Tiananmen Square also."
you can hire a tour at the entrance. you can walk by yourself through. i'd recommend to arrive early. book a ticket online. admire the art and the wisdom cherished through the ages.
"I managed to venture almost every corner/hall except Hall of Literary Brilliance, which is the where the Pottery Gallery, as it is closed for reno.

As soon as you enter the Palace through the Meridian Gate, on your left is the Hall of Martial Valor, also the Painting Gallery. On your right is the Hall of Literary Brilliance and also where the East Gate is ( not open for exit in the morning). Don't waste time going to East Gate area because there was no notice of the temporary closure at the entrance area.

Overall a good experience and please get audio guide ( >20 foreign languages and other Chinese dialects including Cantonese). The ticket office for foreigner passport holders will be on the right side (3 booths manned by English speaking officer) just before the security bag check queue."
We visited in January which was lucky as we were told that in the summer the whole of the square that we were freely walking around would be covered in tourists..we got to see everything with ease although it was very cold.I saw the army marching and singing that i really enjoyed.We had a very enjoyable morning here
The Forbidden City is a massive complex of historical buildings with beautiful architecture. You could spend days wandering around here. A lot of exhibits were closed when we were there in November but we still got to see the main throne rooms and the garden.
"What can I say. This is the one place you need to be when visiting Beijing. Yes, it's always crowded but there are a lot to see. We have been here several times and each time we found new things to capture our attention. Security was tight on this last time we were there with lone line for security check. It was so crowded that we were not able to get a closer look at the Hall of Supreme Harmony. It's just an awesome experience standing in the middle of this palace."
"I had a 12 hour stop over in Beijing. I stayed overnight near the forbidden city and I woke up early to see it. The forbidden city opens at 8am. It costs 40yuan to enter (I went January time). We went through the forbidden city quickly bec it was very cold and bec we had a flight to catch. But it was worth the while going. You can also walk the walk around the city. There is a free bag check on the left as soon as you walk into the city.
If you would also like to go to Tiananmen Square then you should go there first, as you can’t walk from the forbidden city to Tiananmen since it’s a one way walk path (security stops you)."
"Even if you are in Beijing just for 1 day-visiting the Forbidden City is a must!! To buy a ticket you must present your passport, so always keep your passport with you.The entrance to the City is from the side of the Tiananmen Square. It is also quite time consuming to find a ticket office for the Palace, as it is located at the right hand corner and surrounded by some kind of a fence. To enter the fence you need to tell that you would like to buy a ticket. The beauty and majesty of the Forbidden City is beyond the ability to describe it. It must be seen with your own eyes.There are definitely a lot of visitors even in winter, but the territory is so huge that you will not even feel like being surrounded by the crowd. Simply to see around quickly and to take photos will take 2h. But if you have a lot of time in Beijing you can spend the whole day there. I highly recommend Forbidden City for all Beijing tourists."
I was impressed with the size and beauty of the Forbidden City. The history surrounding it is fascinating. Definitely worth stopping for while in Beijing!!
"The Palace Museum - Forbidden City - is well worth a full day visit.
Most tour groups rush through, just visiting the main halls and courtyards, but there is much to see and explore besides. The numerous side buildings/pavilions contain interesting, often overlooked, displays and artifacts. It is also quite pleasant to relax at one of the several snack bars and enjoy the atmosphere. Take your time to truly discover the many delights presented by this vast, historical, construction. And if time allows, do visit the two delightful parks the flank the entrance way to the Palace Museum. They are treasures in themselves. You will be unlucky to encounter a tourist, only a few Chinese advantaging themselves with an escape from the frenetic activity of life outside the walls. You can even lie down on one of the many park benches and take a quiet, secure, little nap."
"I think that the place is impossible to skip and you feel a sensation like thousands of years historical traditions, very crowed but deserve all the rating possible"
"I would definitely recommend getting the audio guide. It has heaps of information but can get a wee bit slow and boring in places. Wandering around this amazing place is a treat, so much history and culture. Its a real eye opener to Chinese culture under the Emperors. Watch out for unofficial ""tour guides"" who try to get to you before you go in. After all the walking, you can't go out the way you came in so be prepared for a lot more walking to get out of the place!!! Paying extra to visit the Clocks and the Treasure is definitely worth it. For amazing views across Tiananmen Square, pay extra to go up into the gate at the start of the Forbidden City"
I was there as part of a tour group that was arranged from a business trip. We went to several sights like this. Worth stopping to take in a cultural experience older than many countries.
Big place . Recomend one to read up the history prior to visit to appreciate the building and history better.
What I liked was the sheer planning happening by the chinese government .There are english guides whose services we took from the window where we bought tickets.The audio equipment worked well. She took about 2.5 hours to make us go through.After we finished we were taken to a park opposite the exit of the this place and we climbed with the translator and from there we could see a lovely view of the forbidden city palace (golden colour of the roof) was simply awesome. We bought some souveniers along with way when we were coming down. super experience.
"I was at the entrance of the forbidden city, when a young couple speaking a fluent English (no normal in Chinese people) came to us asking where we come from.. Etc etc after some minutes of conversation (where they show some knowledge about our countries) they invited us for a tea. After walk around 10 min we arrive to small tea shop where, we were invited to seat inside a room with just one table in authentic privacy. After start to drink the tea and good conversation the young man ask 4 glasses of red wine in order to wish us good luck (the red is good luck colour for Chinese people). After the good moment.. Came the bill... 1047 RMB (135 EUR). Because I started to see that the Chinese couple didn't want to pay...and they started saying ""if you don't have cash... Pay with card.."" and the owner of the bar in aggressive mood speaking in Chinese... Started to Intimidate us to pay the bill... I decided to pay...
After this... I check on internet and I saw that we were not the first victims of this scam! (in some cases the bill can be 400 EUR)

So if someone invite you for a tea, think 2 times before go."
"Beyond Imagination. I have been watching dramas from China since I was a child, and visiting this place was like stepping into a place I have been thinking about all my life.

The first 3 halls was the most grand, with one emperor chair each. These 3 halls are also the most well-maintained in the whole forbidden city (imo). Some of the halls are under renovation or closed. Netherless we spent 5 hours exploring the whole place even though we did not enter every exhibition. So please be come early or spend the whole day if you prefer a slower pace. If you are going to pay to enter timepiece museum/clock and watch museum (钟表馆), please note that there are performances at 11am and 2pm. There will be a glass display of several clocks at the end of the hall. The staff will randomly pick 2 clocks and you can see how the clock turns and listen to their melody.

Visit Jingshan Park after this to get an overlook of Forbidden City!"
When on a tour and it was a very huge area. You will need the entire day to explore this place. The tour is fine but you are rushed from one location to another. Too alot of pictures. We went back on our own a few days later to see things at our pace which was great. January is less crowded but extremely cold. Suggest you go in April if possible.
"I definitely enjoy the garden because there are some pretty interesting trees there.

I suggest taking the portable audio guide because without it, you would be looking at just building. After a while, all the buildings look the same. But, if you know the background story of that particular building or room, then your trip would be more informative and more enjoyable.

at the end, there are souveniour shops and a mini snack shop selling hot drinks. The hot chocolate was a dissappointment unfortunately. It does not taste like chocolate at all."
"Beijing's existence is centred on this amazing piece of architecture. Built in the 1400's by Zu Di (Emperor Yongle) this palace is the shining light of architecture in the city. Apart from its incredible size, the sights here will easily fill a day (and if you're a history buff like myself) two days. So much to see! Highly recommend the eastern palace area for the Dragon Screen, Treasure and Clock Museums. Don't count on a meal in this area though. The food was bland and dry and the 'cold' drinks were warm. Yongle would have had the kitchen staff executed! lol"
"The Forbidden City is one of those ""must see"" items even though I think Lama Temple and Summer Palace are much more interesting. Some tips to go: first the place is giant, way bigger than you think so it will take time. Second, go to Jinshan Park first and see the view of the entire city, its great. Third, stick to the edges, it is very crowded, but everyone goes to the same attractions in the center (the throne etc.) to be honest you have to push and shove past people just to see a chair (not worth it). If you wander along the outside you can find some peace and equally cooler, if not cooler, stuff. Finally, make sure you bring your passport and walk all of the way through to the last ticket place on the right hand side. We went to the first place we saw on the left and ended up buying tickets to see Mao's body, which we didn't want."
Had a great day very pretty to see but by the end of walking we had had enough of them as they all look more or less the same 😀 the hot chicken burger and coffee at the end for 20y was well needed 😀 good day and not expensive x
Its as if they make it hard on you on purpose. Took us an hour to figure out how to get in. 5 different huts at 5 different places very far away from each other each with a queue and no sinage in english. One is tickets one is for security one is for lockers one who knows what the line is for only once you reach your turn u get to figure out what you were standing in line for. By tge time we got in we did not have much time left. When we needed to go we had to endlessly walk through patks to guess where the exit is. No sinage and no one speaks english. Were not allowed to exist from entrace. Wow! Not fun! I would eithere take a one on one guide next time or not go. A guide also gets you in without queues. But not sure would even want to go tgere again quite traumatized and the little I saw was 80 percent cement floors. Maybe nicer stuff further in. We should have just strolled in theocal streets just outside the forbidden city they have a good vibe and some shops. But were in a hurry so didn't. Not sure this is a must see at all.
"Be ready to send your imagination in the history of the Chinese people. You will feel like a movie hero...Be prepared with a hat and water during summer, also have patience getting your ticket. Please be sure to have your passport with you! Do not carry lighters or any other dangerous materials."
"I visited the Forbidden City on a cold but clear day in January of 2018. Going with a friend who is Chinese, he helped get me through a variety of hurdles. First, you go through security not unlike the TSA at home. To buy tickets, you will need more than one, you must show your passport, but once through the first wall, the vista that greets you is literally unlike anything I have ever seen before and I have been to Machu Picchu and Karnak, the Great Pyramids, even Petra. There are 900 buildings and every one has survived tremendous earthquakes since 1420. We spent a day there and it was worth every minute."
We took the subway here from our hotel. Very cold the day we visited and full of tourists. We found it very interesting and enjoyed seeing the soldiers. The only problem was leaving the area. Hard to find a taxi.
Do yourself a favor and rent one of those electonic guides at the entrance. This place ins aweinspiring. You can vist Teanament Square right opposit it in the same day. I'd recommend going to Tianamen Square first.
No stop to Beijing is complete without a visit here. Walk forever to get through each hall that has been preserved amazing over the centuries.... Yes it is mind boggling...
Obviously a must do if in Beijing. Remember to that ale ur passport or you if ur going solo as you won't be able to purchase a ticket to get in.
Great place to visit ... take a packed lunch and good walking shoes ... once you get in however and decide to leave .. you cannot re-enter ... beautiful architect and history ...
Hugely interesting visit to a world class monument. Felt like going back in time to a different world. Fascinating! Weather during our visit was bitterly cold but we wrapped up well so it wasn't a major problem. Our Travel Department Guide (David) was excellent and brought this visit to life...highly recommended!
"The place is huge and after a while you get to see the same things on and on. The thing is I was expecting to see the buildings inside as well. But most of them are empty or you are only allowed to see them from the entrance, where you have to struggle within the crowd.
There is a watch museum and another exposition, but you have to pay extra to see them."
"Its even better than the films, It's a real journey in time.

- wear Comfortable shoes
-in some places is not allowed to take photos
-Arrive early or Will Be very crowded"
"This was a beautiful place to visit. I would definitely recommend hiring a guide or getting the audio guide. It's a massive complex and going alone, it would be difficult to discern which buildings are interesting and important or to understand the symbolism of the carvings and paintings. I really enjoyed learning about the history of China and how this space was used by the emperors, and just standing in awe of the vastness of the place, the intricate details, and the beautiful art."
We had to bring our passport with us to buy the from the office. But the city in amazing and big and unreal.
"Must-see attraction inside city of Beijing. If you have only a day, pick this!

Entrance is affordable (can skip the audio guide if you are in a rush or not keen to learn about the history). They tried to make everyone pay via wechat, so for the tourists, Q is almost empty (must bring your passport) - anyway you need this to clear the security check when coming in from Tiannanmen.

The whole place is massive and I must say the museum shops are the best among the attractions I been to, not the cheapest but they definitely have the nicest stuff. Don't buy the common stuff you can get outside, get things exclusively designed for the palace. They can break a hole in your wallet easily but there are some tiny corner shops who sell some stuff at cheaper price compared to the rest.

Lots of gardens, artefacts, places where the royals stayed... interesting to see. If you have 100RMB to spare, pay to dress up in the costumes and take home some photos. LOL. It was worth the price and much laughter when I showed them to my family."
"If you have the chance to book the tickets in advance - do it! I stood in various lines throughout the day which easily totaled two hours! Sadly, i'm not exaggerating. Get tix in advance and avoid the lines. Also, unless you're feeling adventurous, avoid the Beijing Tiananmen International Travel Service which is a tour company inside one of the gift shops in the Forbidden City. I paid 300 rmb for a group tour to Mutianyu Great Wall and it was the most confusing yet oddly enjoyable tour I've ever been on. The driver picked me up at 6:30am at my hotel (showed up on time) but could not speak English even though I was promised an English speaking tour. I guess the driver doesn't count as part of the tour. So when he pulled over 30 mins later in front of a Burger King and motioned for me to get out of the van with the other non english speaking customers, I knew I was in for an unexpected day. Let's just say you have to be able to go with the flow to find this tour enjoyable."
Definitely worth a visit if you are in Beijing. It is a beautiful historical place especially if you have read novels about emperor and a Forbidden city...so many things to see
"This was fascinating insight into a different cultures take on divinity of a ruler. Try to go in Feb/March to avoid the queues, you'll also have the Spring lantern festival to top it but it is also easier to move about the place...it was busy enough for us and that wasn't the tourist height!"
"Be at the Meridian gate before opening time with your passport - you’ll need it to purchase tickets, which we did at windows on the right just outside the gate. Only ticket window #4 accepted credit cards. On the advice of a travel guidebook, we made our first stop the ceramics display in the Hall of Literary Brilliance, one of the smaller buildings east of the enormous main halls. The ceramics are spectacular and worth seeing, but go straight to the main halls first, before the crowds swell and make it much harder to get close enough to peer through open doorways (visitors aren’t allowed inside) to see the emperor’s Dragon Throne and other treasures. We also loved the interesting displays of timepieces in the Clock Exhibition Hall (additional 10 yuan entry fee), the courtyard homes in the Western Palaces, and the beautiful Imperial Gardens. We spent roughly a half-day here."
After the greatchinese wall the forbidden city is the second most imoirtant attraction to visit atouns Beijing.
"Amazingly beautiful. Long walks on flat surfaces to view similar artifacts and buildings.
Rich in a culture dedicated to an emperor and his court."
I never dreamt that it would be so HUGE! Walking through the series of interconnecting squares you could not fail to feel the history beneath your feet. Such an impressive place to visit.....the sheer scale of the squares and beauty of the buildings will remain in my memory forever.
"Another Beijing must see. Make sure to take your passport and access the ticket box to the right of the main gate. Audio guides are available for 40 cny and are useful for the GPS map of the site. Obviously lots of impressive history but over the huge site, the temples all start to look the same. Be prepared to press your nose up to dirty glass to see inside some of the buildings or be jostled by crowds to see through some of the doorways. The gardens at the rear of the site are peaceful and lead you to the exit gates. Be prepared to be hassled by taxi touts but when we walked to the ""official"" taxi stand, was refused the request to the silk market due to traffic! What the? It's Beijing!!
We walked to the left along the frozen canal and watched the old men flying kites. Walk along the outside wall keeping it to your left, past some beautiful hutong buildings and you will come to Beijing west metro station. Sometimes the best sites are the ones you discover by accident."
"As my title reads it's boring. You'd think there'd be an attraction or role plays, but nothing. Once you've been in for ten mins you have to come out. Given that this was where emporers lived there's nothing to impress"
Very impressed place to visit. It is always busy but once inside the sheer size of the place lets you get around to see most of the places of interest without too much problem. You will need ID to buy your tickets (foreigners take a passport) brace yourself for crazy crowds and enjoy.
The palace is really big and spacious. You need a lot of walking and you will easily get lost. Too crowded with tourist. You need to spend almost an hour and half.
"The Forbidden City was so much larger than I expected, and truly lives up to its name. The buildings are all very beautiful, and the carvings and paintings intricate."
"We visited Forbidden City all by ourselves because it is near our hotel. There are lots of people going to Forbidden city that time.
The place is magnificent, the buildings are well preserve and the place is clean. There are food stores inside so you can eat and rest inside the city. It was a long walk going out but it is worth it to see one of China's historical place.
There are also souvenir shops inside the city if you want to bring some stuff home.
must visit when in Beijing."
"My second visit of the Forbidden City after the first one more than a decade ago. Much tighter security is in place now and they imposed daily limit on the number of visitors. So, get there early to wait in queue.

This time we visited the buildings on both sides. Off season is less crowded but much colder."
"This is one for history buffs and camera buffs. BUT..... if you have small kids, please don't expect to enjoy this. You have to walk a LOT, and small kids will not like it. You can take a stroller around, but there are so many places where you go up and down stairs, it will tire you out. If you have little kids, find a baby-sitter at the hotel. May be expensive, but worth it. I saw many tourists with little kids coming to grief half-way through the long walk from entrance to exit. Another thing: if it is a hot day (as it was when we went in mid-September) you will need a water bottle! The crowds did not detract from the enjoyment of the place, they were well behaved, and orderly. By the way, read up on this place before going, you will appreciate it better. Also, get a guide to show you around (we were with a tour group, Wendy Wu tours, so we had our Beijing guide to explain things to us). The place is massive, and with so many things to see, and so many buildings, it is impossible to do justice to it without a guide. Must see if you are in Beijing for even a day!"
Very big place and lots of buildings inside and it was all man made. Really worth of visiting here. The main palace and other buildings are covered by tiananmen square. Its covered by these walls so it called forbidden city. The garden was very good. Over all must visit place.
"We went on a Saturday which in hindsight was a mistake as it was much busier but all the websites say you have to prebook your entrance tickets (which you don’t) you can buy on the day.
A definite must for any tourist in Beijing"
"Portable translation machine avalable for the visit - help to understand all the buildings and what's happened to all - a lot of walking, bring water and toilet paper."
Very restored and you definitely feel what it would have been like in the imperial age. Extremely fascinating. Go early. Don’t forget your passport for entry. Large grounds to cover so spend many hours here. You will not be disappointed. Only con is too many people
"There are plenty of reviews telling you to go. I concur, go :) What you need to know is that as long as you do not go in the weekend or on psecial public holidays, you will be fine, there is plenty of room. Just remember to take lots of water or be prepared to buy lots of water or local beer. It's quite a walk and if you have young kids, again no problem. Just do the direct through the middle walk (still feels like it takes forever) and give them time out of the sun and they will enjoy the trek. We went on a hot day and survived. What I do suggest however is that if you have the time and the weather is smoggy, go do something else. It is one thing in Biejing to be hot but the smog is what makes it unpleasant. So if time allows, plan according to the weather. As for this majestic attraction, unbelievably worth the effort to see. Nothing like it, bit like the wall. Beijing is a great place to visit."
One of the top man-made attractions of the world. The History is fantastic! The Buildings are Fantastic. The open yards are Fantastic. Do not miss this Attraction as you will never see anything to compare it to.
My first visit of forbidden city was 10 years ago. Now it is a lot of changes and prepare to walk a lot outside forbidden city. Before entrance and exit was on side of Tianmen square. Now entrance is from Tinamen square but exit is on sideway of forbidden city. Afrer finishing of visit is impossible to return on Tianmensquare. Exit is not marked well and after finding exit you must walk outside walls of forbidden city to reach Tianmensquare. Very stupid to walk on side street. Prepare to walk a lot
"We went off-season, and first thing in the morning the Palace museum is not crowded, and fairly easy to get tickets. You can buy tickets at the Ticket office in the courtyard, closest to the Entrance of the museum, which opens at 8.30am. We recommend you arrive to queue, or if you can, use Chinese online ticket purchasing - an option not open to foreign travelers, i.e. people without a Chinese bank account.

It is an insanely popular tourist attraction, thus we recommend that you start early, and avoid weekends and/or national holidays. By 11am the site is swarming with tour groups who move in swarms from one building to the next. The side palaces and garden is a bit more peaceful, however the gardens will rapidly fill up at lunchtime.

The Palace Museum can easily take a day or more to fully explore, thus it helps to be early, and to plan ahead for meals, etc.

There are a number of restaurants, including a fine-dining lunch venue which serves some of the nicest Beijing duck you can find in Beijing - easily puts Quanjude to shame with a Modern-Chinese twists on its menu. However, make sure you make a booking once inside the forbidden city, and order your lunch in advance. They can run out of things very quickly, and pretty much only serve lunch and coffee during normal Museum hours.

There are many exhibitions within the various smaller palaces, both temporary and permanent, and at the Southern gate is a range of high-end boutiques offering some of the finest crafts China has to offer. There are other gift shops within the Museum grounds.

We recommend a visit to Jingshan (Park) Gongyuan after your visit to the Palace."
It is obviously impressive but Versailles has more charm for me. Visiting in January has its perk as the place is almost deserted.
"Wow!! The scale of the place is incredible! My thoughts are to go early to avoid the crowds- we went in the New Year. What I did notice are that the bulk of people shoot straight up the middle and miss out the many palaces either side of the main rooms that tell some amazing stories. You need at least 4 hours to get through.
We did a self guided tour and saved on a guide or a tour- don’t think I missed out on anything.
PS. Dont forget your passport as there are some spots that require your passport for entry!"
"Worth visit when in Beijing, though the buildings inside may look all similar and repetitive, but we really enjoyed our walk."
"Not to be missed! Wear comfortable shoes and prepare to be in awe. If possible, read up on the Forbidden City before going. The history is fascinating!"
We were on a mission trip to Whuhan in 2000 and went to the Forbidden City as a side trip. The place is huge and very beautiful. The people were wonderful and the colors were many.
"It is definately worth visiting, no doubt. As a local Beijinger, I would like to share some tips for visiting and photo shooting without ""people mountain people sea""
On line booking is a must and visitors must take passport/ID card to pass the security check. Drinking water is allowed to bring in. However, there are plenty shops inside the museum to sell food, water, souvenirs, and their price is reasonable.
There are less visitors in winter season than summer. Visitors may see their official website one day before to see the ticket selling. The same as other museums, it does not service the public on Mondays, but public holidays are exception. The attached picture was shot on the afternoon of 1st January (Monday), with very few people.
After 4pm, staffs start to close the showrooms one by one and do not accept new visitors. Having considered the 1-2 hour security check, visitors are strongly recommmended to arrive at the place at noon-time by latest."
You certainly need to take you time and walk through to get a sense of the magnitude of this place in the middle of Beijing. We had a guide with us so we got a lot of the history and information to put everything into perspective. Amazing!
"Such a vast area to cover, we managed a fair bit of exploring around this site, absolutley amazing the architecture, well worth seeing"
"So much history over thousands of years preserved on this site.

Worth getting a guide to cover this attraction. Plan to spend at least 4-6 hours to get a good tour."
I have seen more beautiful palaces but the sheer size of this palace makes it worth a visit. Very well maintained and its a nice walk inside the palace. Finding a back to come back from the palace is a forgettable experience though; none of the cabbies agreed to charge us the fare shown by the meter and instead quoted at least 8-10 times the reasonable fare.
"Visiting Beijing, you must visit here. We used to watch drama and movies to describe forbidden city. But when I visit it. It is smaller than the scenes in movies. Feel like a park more than a political centre of Qing dynasty."
"Have your hotel book your entrance tickets online, and collect to the right of the main entrance – it is convenient and quick. When you enter, go left to climb up onto the wall – beautiful views. The central axis gets very busy, so detour to the right and left. The architecture is beautiful, and one can only imagine the grandeur during its heyday. On your exit, cross over to Jingshan Park for stunning views to appreciate the magnitude of the Forbidden City. Also, consider a visit to the Working People’s Cultural Palace to appreciate the architecture and landscape without the throngs of people."
"This is an amazing area from Tiananmen Square - a series of palaces. You could only advance as far into the complex as your station allowed - ministers so far, eunuchs and concubines, royalty and the Emperor himself.
The architecture, tiles and decoration on the buildings and odd statues are wonderful. You can peek into some rooms, but irritatingly the only available door always seems to have the view blocked by pillars, while the others remain closed!
Its a huge complex, so will take time and energy to view it. And you'll want to take plenty of photos of the dragons and decorations!"
"This is a must-see place for any visit to Beijing and it doesn’t disappoint. Just be prepared for queues (initially just to enter Tiananmen Square before you even get to the FC), security checks and crowds of people. But it’s still worth it."
"The forbidden palace offers online ticket purchases but if you are a foreign student, you should consider purchasing it in person to obtain the student price ticket. However, do note they have a certain cap on the number of visitors daily so if you want to be extra safe, do purchase the ticket early in the day.

I would highly recommend you to get the electronic guided tour to gain a more in-depth understanding of the palace and its infrastructure as the signs are rather minimal. Overall, a great experience and it’s simply marvelous how this structure came about."
The Forbidden city is immense and grand. We appreciated the audio tour but because it was so crowded it was hard to move around. We visited over the New Year’s holiday weekend so the Chinese visiting the city even though it was bone chilling cold. Still amazing history at this historic attraction. The flag raising and lowering ceremonies take about an hour and no one can move or leave tianamen square during it.
"This place is huuuuuge,so wear comfortable shoes. Buildings and terraces are amazing , sculptures as well. There are places with coffee and snacks and of course with souvenirs - and prices are the same like in other places .
Unfortunately our guide decided to spent too much time in souvenirs shop - obviously we knew why - instead of in the wonderful Imperial Garden...."
"A guided tour is a good idea to get a better understanding of the Ming dynasty (Chinese Imperial Palace) from 1420 to the end of the Qing dynasty in 1912, amazing historical information and culture .
Very busy in August and school holiday periods and can be very hot and humid. Ensure you have your passports with you. Can expect line up delays at this time of the year, also cigarette lighters cannot be taken into the Forbidden City, this can be heavily screened upon entry which is understandable when seeing all the palaces, statues, and artefacts in the Forbidden City.
This is China's most popular single site tourist attraction and is the largest ancient palace in the world, one of 3 still remaining in China and a UNESCO World Heritage Site with 14 million visitors per year.
The history at the site (180 acres) continues to astound as you walk through each unique palaces which are several hundred years old and history of all the monarchs over the centuries is truly amazing.

The Forbidden City is also handy with its central location to some of the great shopping in Beijing (see Wangfujing Street).
Beijing has a 72-hour visa-free entry, Forbidden City is a must on one of these days in the capital of Beijing.
Be prepared for a lot of walking and an early start to make the most of the day."
"You enter from one side and proceed in a somewhat linear fashion to see and feel a beautiful set of spaces linked by terraces and steps, a wonderful experience that makes a strong impression on your memory and your sense of history..."
"I would say I covered about 80% of this ""huge complex"" in about 4.5 hours of wandering around its grounds (and for those who have been to Gyeongbokgung the biggest palace of Korea, just to give an idea of how much ground area to cover here, this palace complex is like twice the size and with about four times as many buildings compared to that one in Seoul).

As far as what to expect, it won't take too long to get through the three or four ""big square-like areas"" after entering from the south gate (which is the only way to enter), but I would say those squares provide ""pretty good photo-ops"" with the great beautiful halls & grand stairways on the ends of the squares (a few minutes' walk to get from one end to the other end of each square). So, it's actually the back areas (which is the north side of this huge complex) where there are those so-named Six Eastern Palaces & Six Western Palaces that will take up most of your hours here although each individual one of those palaces occupies a ""fairly-small"" area that can be covered in a reasonable amount of time; you'll actually likely spend more time ""navigating your way"" from one small palace to another along the narrow passageways than spending time at the palaces themselves where the rooms can mostly be just taken a peek inside from right outside (furniture & things like that to be seen inside) although there are some museum-like rooms that can be entered. There's also Imperial Garden (all the way on the north side pretty close to the north gate which is the only way to exit the palace complex) with its prominent feature being rock formations & some small pavilions than plants or flowers (the narrow walkways in the garden can be quite crowded since most people go through the garden to get to the north gate for the final exit out of the Palace).

Should not be missed among ""all that multitude"" of buildings though are two buildings: the first is the Treasure Gallery with the Nine-Dragon Wall nearby (I was just amazed by that long wall of beautifully carved & colorful dragons at an area near the Gallery and the shiny gold items of various shapes & sizes inside the Gallery), and the second is the Clock Museum (with big & ""elaborate"" clocks inside, some of them so elaborate that you'll think they are ""something other than"" a clock!); both are on the east side of the palace complex (just a short walk to the right after getting through the big squares that you'll have to get through after entering the Palace as mentioned above), and each of those two places costs an additional 10 Yuan for the entry on top of the 60 Yuan for the initial entry.

Coming by metro, Tiananmen East Station (Line 1) is where to get off from which it's just about a 15-minute walk (about 10 minutes to get to Tiananmen Gate Tower with a big portrait of Mao Zedong, and about another 5 minutes after going through that gate). One thing to keep in mind though is that there's ""no going back"" once you get through Tiananmen Gate Tower, so if your plan for the day is to also visit the National Museum (directly across the street once you've come out of the metro station), I suggest you do that first (there's an underpass in front of Tiananmen Gate Tower to get across the wide Chang'an Ave.) before going through the Gate Tower on your way to this palace complex, but yes the best thing in my opinion is to do the National Museum on another day and just set aside ""a whole day"" for this huge site although what can be done on the same day are going up Tiananmen Gate Tower (which just costs 15 Yuan for a ""panoramic view"" of Tiananmen Square right in front across Chang'an Ave.) before entering the Palace and then afterwards going over to Jingshan Park (which costs a mere 2 or 3 Yuan and just across the street from the north gate where you exit) where there's a pavilion uphill with a big Buddha and from which there's a ""pretty-awesome"" bird's eye view of this entire palace complex."
"After visiting Tienanmen Square we continued our walking through the Forbidden City.

This place is soo huge with amazing architecture and history."
This place is huge. Looooottttssss of walking and picture taking. The palace building has been preserved and kept well. We didnt go with tour group because we want to hv our own sweet time in the palace compound. Bring your own water and food for snacking. Come early during weekdays except Monday (Monday closed). Bring your passport because they will use it for ticket issuance. This is a MUST place to go in Beijing.
"I enjoyed this, would suggest a tour guide if you do not know the language.
Or order the headset. Not as exciting as I thought but a must do as it is a huge part of Chinese history."
"I went to the forbidden city twice the time. It is the second time, and now the Cining Gong is open, and they have the exhibition of Buddha statue, it is the place for Emperor's mother used to live and the grand ceremony for birthday or marriage of a princess. I can feel its different with another palace living for a concubine or noble lady."
"Great place to visit very expansive and huge, a lot of walking to do. The architecture is ancient and beautiful.
The place is super crowded though even in the off season like November."
We visited on a tour and enjoyed it very much. Spend at least a couple of hours as it is very large.
Security was rather tight in China at metro/subway & popular tourist attractions. There is only 1 Meridian Gate entrance. All access to it & Tian’anmen square need to go through an hour's queue (my queue was crowded like sardines 200ft only) XRays & 100% body search individually. Only 3 security lines were opened on 26th Dec. Your entrance ticket is meant for Forbidden City's main halls. You need to pay extra to visit other halls like 9 dragons screen with jewelry exhibition. Opens daily except Monday (max 80k pax). You can buy tickets online in advance.
"From the large picture of Mao to the monks. This is truly China. I noticed many plainclothes police. All young men with short hair and black jackets along with more ceremonial dressed guards. It actually added to the experience. The Gate of the divine might. Very crowded. Almost 1000 buildings, you could not see it all in a week."
"Forbidden city is a must visit place recommended by locals , here, you can view the architecture of chinese buildings in olden days. different kind of embroidery like painting on walls. Shame visitors are not allowed inside the buildings itself.
Do not forget to take your passports to get entry."
"In order to get full picture visiting the forbiden city, I would recommend to use s local guide with good English. The place is big and wide, a lot to see, note that it is closed on Monday."
"The forbidden City is an amazing place to visit.
However take note of following:
Be there early to be ahead of the crowds
Take your time inside to appreciate it all
Then make sure you visit Jingshan Park on the northern side of the Forbidden City and go up all the way to the top!"
"Visiting the Forbidden City is one of the most beautiful things I have ever visited. It very strongly reminded me of the scenery from the film ""The last Emperor"". Very well preserved monumental palace, we were very impressed by the imperial thrones (although we managed to get only a quick glimpse because of the crowd). Having a guide was very helpful, but if not, we suggest to have a good tourist guide book in order to get oriented and understand what you are looking at. Probably the number one sight to visit when in Beijing."
"A UNESCO World Heritage Site, the Forbidden City is another must-visit place in Beijing. As tourist, you will need to show your passport when purchasing tickets. The ticket counter for foreigners is on the right side on the entrance. It can be confusing but asked around for directions. We opted for the GPS audio guide the audio guide did not work at times but all you have to do is to pull out and plug in the headset whenever you sense that the GPS signal is weak. The Forbidden City serves as the palace for many emperors during the Ming and Qing Dynasty and the area is huge. Hence you will probably need to cater at 3/4 of a day. Due to time constraint, we walked straight and covered only the major pavilions till we reached the back entrance. From there, we took a local bus to go to a nearby subway station. Do not take the tourist bus 1 and 2 which is a rip off and they only send you to the front entrance."
"One of the most beautiful things to visit in our entire trip. Unbeliavable buildings, monuments, museums etc. Everything is so grandiose- it blew one's mind."
"If's probably a bit of a well-worn cliche but a trip to the Forbidden City should be near the top of a list of places to visit, if not the very reason, when in Beijing. Yes, it's large, it's old and it smacks of an era long gone, but the appeal to see where twenty-four emperors of two dynasties spanning almost five hundred years (from the 15th to the early-20th centuries) lived retains an appeal that is hard to shake. Being such a large attraction, some of the statistics associated with the palace are mind-boggling: 720,000 square metres, over 9,000 buildings, a further 9,000 rooms containing furniture and/or crafts, almost two million cultural relics, the list goes on and on.

Visitors will follow a well-trodden path starting at the southern entrance, first passing through the great halls of the Outer Court which were used for major official ceremonies, before entering the Inner Court that served as the living and working area of the emperor and his family, and eventually exiting at the northern end. It's quite easy to get overwhelmed by the sheer amount to see and take in, so having a guide - be it in the form of an app, rented audio (some reviewers have found this to be awful), or human - may be helpful. Try to start the visit as early as possible - not just to beat the majority of the crowd, but especially if intending to negotiate the security queue by entering from Tiananmen Square. Approximately four to six hours would be adequate to do reasonable justice during a visit although it is easily possible to spend the entire day there. And although there is a restaurant within the palace grounds, it can get quite crowded at lunch time, so bring drinks and some snacks just in case. Finally, while it's been popularly noted that the price of entry in the past used to be instant death, today's entrance fee of 60 RMB (or 40 RMB during the winter months) is an absolute bargain compared to sites of similar importance around the world."
"This is a must do when in Beijing and possible a good reason to visit. We were on a China Highlights Tour, so our guide helped us through the many buildings in the Palace, of which there are many. Basically this was forbidden to all except the Emperors family and visitors until several years after the fall of the Dynasty. Check out the number of animals on the roof corners, the emperors building has 10."
"Great things to see and hear about ancient China. The life style of the emperors and how China has evolved to what it is today.

So many tourists and cold during winter. You may need warm and comfortable clothing."
"Nice to visit, yet not totally impressive.
Architecture is good looking and much details in the buildings."
"Forbidden City tour is only 1/3 of entire area. We had a private guide which I would recommend for non Chinese speaking tourists. You also need to get your tickets in advance as they only sell 80000 a day; your guide will take care of that. If you just show up, you likely will not get in that day."
Way beyond all my expectations. We were here in the Off-season and it was easy to access the whole place. I cannot imagine what it is like in spring & summer... This vast Palace is incredible in its size and beauty. You will need to devote a day to do the Forbidden City and the Jingshan Park overlooking the city back to the south. Wonderful experience.
"Well, that's simply a neverending tour in a infinite city. Golden roofs, three enormus ""squares"" each with his own throne room, exquisites ceilings...
No word to describe it, look at the pictures!"
Around 18k steps in few hours. The translator guide is useful as a GPS to bring you around. The restaurant served nice food with reasonable price. Take the subway to another station to visit shopping centres.
Incredible historic place to see. Almost hard to describe. The beauty and history of the forbidden city is unbelievable. Beijing is a very polluted and smoggy city but it has incredible history and sights to see.
"Intricate carvings on the walls & stairs. It has 7 halls & each one has its own story. Good to know about chinese empire.
Be prepared to walk."
Must see! Amazing place to see for architecture and history! Bucket list must! I would recommend a guided tour.
Amazing place which u can spend a day there. Be prepared to walk a lot. Dun miss the sections u need to buy extra tickets which show the clock n those wearing/ tools etc of the ancient.
"We did this as part of a full day Beijing tour with Leo from beijingwalking.com. It is as everyone says. Majestic and awesome. It just goes on and on forever - amazing architecture and such rich history.

It wasn’t too busy although that’s probably due to it being December low season. We were able to spend uninterrupted time exploring the awesomeness of this place. By the time you’re done you may need a spot of lunch 😜

Definitely go with a tour guide to learn about the background and history. I recommend Beijing Walking Tours. Such great people. Leo actually studied English and History at University so we really got the inside scoop on all the places we visited.

I highly recommend the Forbidden City as part of your Beijing experience. Take water and a good camera. Excellent photo opportunities all round."
"This was part of a bigger trip we did with China Highlights including Tia’anmen Square and the Great Wall.

Whilst the palace buildings themselves were interesting the more valuable part of the experience for me was the tour guide and the stories he could tell us about the history of the Palace and the Dynasties that had lived there. Fascinating anecdotes and information made the experience so much more rich.

Definitely worth a visit if you are in Beijing!"
"Main Access to the Palace Museum is via Chang'An Street at the Tiananmen Entrance. One must alight quite far away from the entrance as vehicles are not allowed to stop along Chang'An Street. There will be several stops for security along the way as Public Security (Police) check visitors for their Identification.

Do not be fool into buying tickets for Tiananmen thinking they are tickets for the Forbidden City. Tiananmen is a Gate of the Forbidden City; there is separate ticket to enter the Tiananmen (tower). Do not confuse this with Tiananmen Square which is a Square facing the Tiananmen Gate. The ticketing office to the Palace Museum is inside the Forbidden City within the Tall Red Walls.

Another entrance is via the South Chizi Street. Not many taxis will take you there as it is difficult to get in and get out.

Purchasing tickets can be a real pain as there are no clear signs for foreigners to purchase tickets. Locals can buy their tickets online or buy through an app which scans a QR Code near the entrance. Foreigners have to purchase their tickets at a ticketing office which isn't called the ticket office but some service centre. Now it is important to note that one will need identification to purchase tickets, one for each visitor.

Once inside, enjoy viewing the many many rooms within the Forbidden City. There isn't any furniture left save for the Throne in the various rooms. In any case no one is allowed inside so viewing is only from afar outside the buildings. As there are many visitors, one will only be able to catch a glimpse of the insides.

Do note some of the nicely sculptured bricks which adorn the side walls of the buildings. They depict either animal or plant themes. Also take note of the metal carvings on the large doors of the buildings, they depict different themes in different buildings. Another item to take note of is the tiled surface within the buildings, the black material is manufactured and not natural stone.

These days the toilets are much cleaner, they are still located in the same place right at the end of the Forbidden City at the Rear Garden.

Save for Tour Buses, vehicles are not allowed to stop along Jingshan Front Street, so when you exit the Forbidden City there will be difficulty getting out of the place. Just hop onto one of those Tour Buses for 20 yuan which will take you to Wangfujing or some other place with public transport.

Definitely Recommend a visit to understand the grandeur of ancient China."
"The first time I went to the Forbidden City was with a tour but this visit was much better because we went with locals. The tours only take visitors to a corner of the site and move on. Not only did that happen to me, in the past, but we saw this happening repeatedly on this visit. Previously, the tour stayed about 30 minutes. As a whole attraction and having time to wander around is much better because you will see more and absorb more of the atmosphere, culture and history. It is a city, with palaces, theatres and courtyards etc. There is a moat around it, which you can see when you exit. If you are visiting independently you will need your passport or a driving licence for proof of ID."
I could not imagine a visit without visiting this palace. This is basically a must do to understand history and how Chinese Empire was big. I was in a day visit due to flight missed and made a quick tour. Going into each detail of this palace may take lots of time. Take your time and enjoy.
"I went in through the eastern gate, featuring a beautiful walk along the only moat accessible to the public. Even in winter, this made for a lovely cold day activity. There was no queue for tickets, perhaps owing to the time if year. I did not go for the guides at the entrance(they ask 300yuan for a private tour), and opted instead for the gps-linked audio guide that I would highly recommend. The length of the tour depends on how much time you have to spend here, I personally found 1 hour to have been perfectly sufficient."
We greatly enjoy the morning at the forbidden city. There was lots to see and Rocky our tour guide was great. He explained everything to us in great details. There was a lot to see.
"One of the great touring experience in Beijing is a tour of the Forbidden City. As one discovers the enclosed city layer by layer, scenes from the movie The Ladt Emperors flashed in one’s mind. Our guide Roy made it very enlightening by giving us a running commentary about each and every aspect. The exhibits in the halls sorrounding the city added to our experience in good measure. A must visit for every visitor."
wear comfortable shoes and go with an open mind. The splendor of the buildings and the history attached to this special place is captivating . Yes some of the architecture does repeat itself but there are subtle differences everywhere for you to enjoy. Be ready to jostle with the crowds but it is very safe indeed .
We went in the morning the crowds were already dense. Be aware you must go through security with your passport before entering actual attraction. Try and get a local guide for a more informed experience.
"The architecture is beautiful, though I feel there is a lot sameness to the buildings in Beijing like the Forbidden City, Summer Palace, and Temple of Heaven. All lovely and worth a visit, but I think one per day. English audio tour was good, not great. Unseated, of course and very cold in December. Watch for the bathrooms, not much until you are about 2/3 of the way through."
"The Forbidden City is a place you definitely have to visit if you go to Beijing. It is unreliably large and the moat and castle walls are incredible. The architecture is wonderfully Chinese and it is one of the most culturally important sites in the world. That being said, after the first few buildings and palaces it starts to get repetitive and they start to blend together in your mind. Luckily there are a lot of other cool things to do around it as well."
"Packed with a loads of ancient Chinese history, this is one place you cannot miss if you are in Beijing. The expanse and the scale of the arts are simply majestic and jaw dropping. I strongly suggest to take your own good head phone along with audio guide provided (since the single ear phone that is provided is not enough to muffle the sounds from the crowd). If you are in group, believe me, it's very essential to stick together to avoid getting lost very easily. Don't get bored just because the architecture all looks the same after few minutes. Don't miss the sundial situated at the top. Take a hat and sunglass to avoid sun."
"Former palace to 24 emperors in Ming and Qing dynasty, it was big to cover on foot. We visited most of the places, but did not pay to go into the 2 exhibitions as we were rather tired by the end..
Getting tickets at the entrance took us quite a bit of time (even though we can speak Mandarin). There are no clear signages on where to purchase tickets. As most locals here just use their phones to scan the QR code and purchase tickets online using Alipay or Wechat pay. So it took us awhile to find out where to buy tickets. You need a passport to get a ticket at 40rmb each. After passing the ticket check area, will see a counter to rent audio guide. 20rmb for Mandarin, 40rmb for foreign languages. We took the Mandarin audio guide and it worked well. Highly recommended to get one, as it explains the different places.
A must visit in Beijing, though it can get a little crowded, but as the palace is really big, you will not feel that it is over crowded. We spent 4hours plus inside.
Upon exit, be prepared to walk 2km to get to Wangfujing pedestrian street, or 3km to get back to Tiananmen square."
Getting my ticket was a breeze during this non peak season just bring your passport to the ticket counter at Wumen. I managed to snap shots of the Emperor’s throne and the famous long palace wall in peace. There were still some groups but nothing as scary as I have read about in the peak tourist season.
It would be easy to spend a whole day here walking around this fascinating place. A guide is certainly recommended if you you want to know about its history.
"It was just ok sort of experience. For international person like me, it was only bunch of rooms with some story of who lived, dined, slept there. I did quick walk and completed in 1 hour...that was enough."
"This place is rich with the Chinese history during the emperor and empress times. A lot of stuff are not original anymore but consider it as a learning journey as you walk through the palaces. There are 9999 rooms and you only only get to visit a few ... there are galleries and stuff so do go in and take a good read.

I would recommend about 2-3 hours here if you really take good pictures and intend to understand the history... otherwise 1-2 hours is sufficient.

Tip: the police at the entrance does body checks and bag scans. Lighters will be confiscated at that time and you’ll be told
That you can pick a lighter towards the exit. However, do be prepared that you might not get a lighter at all in the end. My dad didn’t get it because they said they ran out of lighters so my dad had to buy another. Don’t bring fancy lighters because you’re not getting it back."
It was a cold winter day but still worth the visit. I had no idea what the Forbidden city really was. It was incredible to see the size and scale of this historically place. Read up on the history before you go as it will add meaning.
"Forbidden City is huge! There are waaaay too many things to explore. Be prepared to spend minimum 4-5 hours. It is certainly not the place for practicing to walk in stiletto heels, so I’d recommend wearing comfortable shoes."
This should be in your itinerary if you have 2 days in Beijing. Gives you a detailed understanding of China's legacy
Went here with Odyssey Tours and Kirk was our guide. He is a local and explained all the history. I'm so glad we had him to ourselves and not following someone with a flag and not hearing what they were saying. We could not believe how big it was so prepare yourself for a huge walk.
"Quick walk through of the museum. I had read several books about the emperor and they were made to light in this visit. Allow 3 hours, go left then right to avoid the lines."
This is an amazing place at a scale I have only seen in China. A few of the places need further restoration but overall it is in excellent condition. Only problem with viewing it in tranquility are the crowds. And the locals push if you are in theri way!
This one place not to miss when visiting Beijing. Ordinary people can visit it now. This was the emperor's palace way back then. The architectural designs are magnificent. This compound is so big that it has so many buildings. All walls of the buildings are in red bricks and sturdy. There is also a building that houses the jades and precious stones worn by the emperors and escorts.
History tells about countries future and this place has lot to tell. Good headset available in English.
"I m live here, I don't felt the attraction of the Forbidden City. Till I have been many other country.
Old China is indeed an big Empire in ancient asia. The grand scale of the building will give your Psychic impact.
Thought that, It 's built in time no mechanics."
"I was absolutely blown away by the Forbidden City. It is enormous. The history is fascinating. As a lover of art, I was awestruck by the variety and level of craftsmanship on display: ceramics, textiles, woodwork, painting, calligraphy, stone-carving, bronze-ware, and the overall architecture. We arrived early and spent much of the day walking around, exploring the different courtyards, rooms, and gardens. Highly, highly recommended."
"This was very similar to nesting dolls, except this was palaces instead of dolls. It was amazing to pass through a building, then the courtyard, only to go into another building, then another courtyard, then again, and again. So well kept and clean despite the 30,000 tourists that pass daily."
Joe was my guide and I was so lucky to have him. He paced the day perfectly and I saw as much of the Forbidden City as I wanted. It is so huge but Joe knew the perfect path to take to see the most. It is an amazing place with a lot of very interesting facts. Book Joe and go. You won't regret it.
the entrance opens 8.00am. for us 1 hour was enough. the weather in november was really really cold. it was difficult for us to spend more time.but it was really enough.you can not enter i the buildong everything is close so you just cross the city. of course fantastic experience.have your ticket with you
"You need to purchase the ticket online or ask the hotel to get for you. My hotel Novotel charge me extra 20 rmb for their trouble. Be there early. No just foreigner but local ppl will be crowding this place.
The place is super huge, you will take take nearly full day here."
"1st was 12 years ago (before the china Olympics) and Nov 17 was 2nd time. This place is so huge, glamorous and u stand in awe of it all. There is just never enough time to cover the whole place. 1st time we did the left side after the main halls and this time the right side. We still enjoyed very much 2nd time round. Just that Nov is too cold and windy."
"The name forbidden evokes a sense of intrigue and mystery.I there fore wanted I wanted to visit attraction first before anything in Beijing . However after the visit I discovered there was nothing mysterious or intriguing inside the city.

The city is an Imperial palace built by some of the 24 Emperors of the Ming and Qing dynasty four hundred years ago. The prevailing Emperor lived inside the city with his numerous concubines and wives and Eunuchs as servants to cater to his whims and pleasure. It was forbidden to all others except for special invitees by the Emperor himself.

The palace complex is large and involves extensive walking. .The walk starts at the entrance gate and ends at the exit gate. Once you enter you get out only through the exit gate.There can be no turn backs .The total distance as estimated by our Chinese Air BnB host in Beijing is about 2 Kms of walk and an estimated 2 hours for the tour.

I did not see any wheel chair tourist and am not sure this attraction is senior citizen or disabled friendly.

Senior citizens or others who are not sure about walking through the city may think twice before entering the city. Also remember to take sufficient water. You are unlikely to get any refreshments till you get out of the exit gate.

There is an acute poverty of information inside the city. The communication system in China is generally foreigner unfriendly . The tour inside the city is no exception.Read up about the forbidden city before you visit this place.

We moved with the crowd like a flock of sheep looking at the various exhibits and buildings and snapping photographs of those that looked interesting. Most buildings were identical in style and architecture . If you have seen one you have seen them all.

At the end of the long walk and the experience of looking inside the forbidden city I am of the opinion there was nothing much I would have missed if I had not come here. I don't think any one will take me seriously if I said it was a waste of time and money to walk through this desolate palace. It was however, a refreshing morning walk on a cold November morning and it quenched my curiosity of the insides of the forbidden city. It would be just that for most tourists."
"This is giving a really nice picture of old China and old Beijing. But be prepared to walk, and also many visitors, even though they have restricted the amount of daily visitors. If it is your first time to Beijing or China, do not miss this."
"An historical site with old heritage and cultural and dynasties are well preserved.The Ming dynasty and the guide explained about forbidden city ,the dynasty and his princess could use front gate and the three thousand concurrent have to go thru back door etc.How the dynasty head conducted important meetings were all told by the guide."
Huge and beautiful place to explore. Just a simple tip... do not bring a “ bluetooth selfie stick”.😊
"This is obviously a must see when visiting Beijing.The architecture is stunning and there is so much to look at. you need spent the whole day here , having walked around Tianaman Square already and the Summer Palace to following we just hit the highlights."
"I was delighted when I first entered The Palace Museum and the grand square leading up to the Palace - I immediately recalled the promotional scenes from the movie, The Last Emperor. Instead of thousands of soldiers bowing to the Emperor, there are a few thousand tourists with selfie sticks - but still enthralling.

I spent hours happily walking about the Forbidden City and viewing (at times trying to view but giving up at the most popular sights) the seemingly endless number of sights. And so many beautiful names: The Palace of Benevolent Tranquility, Hall of Mental Cultivation, Palace of Heavenly Purity, and many more. I enjoyed viewing the official dragon art themes (also found at all other Imperial sights). Amongst the splendor (and excess) there are simple items of interest and enjoyment: the imperial sundial and statues of bulls were two that I especially liked. Among the formal sights one that I enjoyed as very low-key and respectful was the Eternal Abundance from Heaven (Auspicious Deer Artifacts of the Palace Museum), which pays tribute to the critical role that deer played in the life of Chinese. Several beautiful paintings, a wonderful vase, and wood carvings.

The number of sights - and the amount of walking involved - are overwhelming. I typically am not much of a shopper, but needed a break at one point to look at something else so visited one of the many excellent gift shops. Also an opportunity for a cold bottle of water.

A quick note for those of us relying upon English language instructions and not part of a tour group: after you have cleared security and then followed one of the lines into the first walled section, go to the far end of the courtyard and on your right will be several lines - it is here that you purchase a ticket. The signage in English when you first come in the courtyard is inaccurate and probably applied when things were arranged for the 2008 Olympics - that signage direct you to the immediate left."
What can I say. Our first day in the city and after Tiananmen Sq we walked using the underground walkway to the city. Great opportunity to understand the culture of China and many pagodas which housed the different class of people
"This is a very crowded attractions...The most in China we saw. There is a whole lot to cover and if you can..Get a guide for there is so much you could learn which otherwise would end up being ..Been there seen that.
We were traveling with kids but still were able to enjoy the monument without issue..Just keep them on a close leash at all times.
Must watch."
"One reason to pay a tour guide could be to get tickets fast since It takes a while to get tickets on your own. But, if you have some time you could visit it on your own. You may need around 3 hours to complete your visit and admire the details of the Palace. If you are going there on your own pay attention to where the entrance is since if you go on the wrong direction it takes forever to get back."
Entering the forbidden city is a great experience that one should do while in Beijing. You do not have to spend looking at exhibits but just walking through the site is very impressive. Lots of dusty artifacts but still the buildings are impressive when you consider their age.
"You can walk around this magnificent site for ages, it was a lot bigger than we thought with 3 temples. The only downside was the the most of the contents was removed and taken to Tibet during a power struggle, it would be nice if they were returned.
That said the visit is one site that we believe should be one of the top places to visit on anyone’s bucket list"
A beautiful mini city made up of small alleys and courtyards all beautifully maintained. Just wander around and soak in the history! A wonderful day out!
"This is a big place so it helps to get someone explain what you are looking at. I joined a tour, but I hear that you could rent an audio guide at the entrance. I was surprised to see many tourists visiting - majority Chinese in the off-season visit. I wonder how much more chaos it will be during summer or their vacation time."
"If your visiting Tianamon square then the forbidden city is opposite, I reckognised it straight away from the Beijing olympics where they did a display by the shawl in monks at the front of it, the scale of it is huge, nice to see some of the original pieces remain, we were with a guide so got lots of information which was really helpful for learning the history of the place"
"We went to the city as we thought we should and it was a fine experience - however, for a foreigner the true experience is hiking up the small hill at the end of the city to see it from above. That was just incredible - seeing the city and its vastness surrounded by the modern Beijing with some hutongs scattered throughout. Well worth the small entry fee of 2 rmb per person."
I am not sure what I expected when I visited the Forbidden City but this place is vast and beautiful. You can visit a lot of sections and it a bit of a walk. Such an amazing must stop if you are Beijing.
"This is a great attraction that costs very little indeed. Well worth the trip, we went by metro which is very easy and accessible to all. You need to allow at a minimum half a day but longer if you can afford it."
"Forbidden city and the palace museum is one of the top activities in Beijing. You have to do it, don't expect too much. There will be many tourists everywhere and the palaces are either empty, closed or really hard to see from the outside. You will need to wait (and push) a lot of people to get a peak of what's inside."
Amazing place. Kevin Dong provided the history and while providing the tour he would give us space to enjoy together without dominating our space.
"This was my 3rd visit to Beijing and my 2nd visit to the Forbidden City and I was still awestricken and had goosebumps as soon as we entered Wu Men Gate.

The sheer size of the imperial palace complex can overwhelm visitors so I suggest take your time and spend a good half a day here if you have time. If you are part of a tour group, you can get the very basic and jest of its opulent, splendid and tumultuous stories and history but if you still have time in Beijing, visit on your own again and take time to enjoy, observe and learn its majestic, sumptuous and salacious romantic saga, tales and history.

Well worth the visit and sometimes the line up can be long but be patient as your effort will be rewarded."
"See it in the news, movies, and magazines, but to see it in person is truly an experience. Wow, a must visit when you are in Beijing, it will take you back thousands of years!"
"We made quite a few mistakes here, particularly because we didn't read up on it well enough prior. Definitely take your passport, theres no chance you're getting in without it, I don't even think a copy or photo will do. Also there is only 1 (maybe 2) entrances and multiple exits. The best way is to start at Tiannemen Square and walk through from there, exiting around the Jingshai Park. We attempted and failed at entering the palace about 3 times because we didn't know of these rules. Pretty cool to see where the Emperor lived and amazing architecture."
"The forbidden city is one of the stops you must do when visiting Beijing. The structure and the history is breathtaking. It is very crowded and everyone is trying to sell you something.

When you decide to visit the forbidden city remember a few things.

1. It’s really crowded... like overwhelming
2. Once you walk in you’re pretty much committed to walking through the whole thing, so plan on a few hours
3. You will do a lot of walking. Plan on walking a few miles, upstairs and downstairs.
4. Keep your wallet in your front pocket. Tons of people touching you and trying to sell you something.
5. Be prepared to take pictures. The locals will treat you like a celebrity and want to take pictures with you and of you. Just roll with it and have a great time!"
Was great to walk around this gorgeous palace. Such a rich history that we were able to share in. Beautiful buildings and waterways. Loved it.
"Loved our visit to the Forbidden City on a recent 7-day trip to China. Beautifully maintained and very atmospheric architecture, including courtyards, walls and gateways. It was easy to imagine what it must have been like hundreds of years ago. Enjoyed stepping from one vista into another through yet another doorway .... and ultimately, the very tranquil (despite many visitors) and pretty gardens at the end. Visiting here enabled a tangible glimpse into the history that we've read about."
"To appreciate better the history, buildings, and all other aspects of this place, best to have a tour guide or at least get an audio guide at the ticketing office. The clock museum is worth of visiting with some great works from Europe you will never see anywhere else."
"The Forbidden City is without a doubt one of the coolest things I did in China. The City is enormous, with thousands of rooms and tons of old buildings chock-full with history. One of my favorite picks for tourist attractions in China"
It starts with a gate and then another gate and then another....Large area spread with across and shows the might of ancient China....a must visit if you are in Beijing!
"Place was not far from our hotel Citytel Inn hotel. We actually were on our way to Forbidden City and bumped into Tian'anmen Square without realising that this was the place...but both venues were back to back. Very impressive...huge complex..so many people visiting at the same time. For tourist, u can buy entrance ticket at booth on the right when u faced the complex. Very tiring but we enjoyed."
"The most beautiful and exciting place to visit , you'll learn the history of how this place restrict from outsider 500 years ago."
"I didn’t have much free time. I managed to find an English speaking tour guide and probably paid too much but he did help with quick access and taking Uber’s from one end to the other. I suggest do the north section first and work your way down to Tiananmen square. The north is mostly gardens. Then you exit and walk down the east side until you find the easy entrance to the main section. That entrance does not have queues. Walk around the main sections and then exit into the square through the main entrance.
There is security check before entering the square directly and that creates queues. So remember to enter the palace from the east gate and then exit through the south directly into the square."
"I stayed an extra day just to see the Palace Museum and it is very much worth it. First of all, book tickets online, it's Beijing, expect to be crowed. Second, it's gonna be a lot walking, Forbidden City is spread out in a huge area. Third, get a guide or an audio guide, otherwise you won't understand a thing, everything in the palace is symbolism, as they serves royalty, the details and what they symbolize are most fascinating. Spend extra 5 Yuan to see the special exhibits, you're gonna see some treasures. Last, see the Palace as it was, not as it is, it is the Republic of China, it can't have lavish spend to maintain it as the emperors had. Feel the momentum of the highest power and the highest standard in ancient China."
"Totaly recommend to all who visit Beijing, the famous Forbidden City! You will need at least 3-4 hours just to walk through the F. City, so take more time for detailed visit! Lot's of souvenirs shops inside,but you can buy almost the same in Liulichang street or somewhere else in the center."
"Despite the crowd, we had an excellent tour of the forbidden city which opened out eyes to the grandeur under which the upper classes of feudal China lived. It also put into perspective the videos we have seen of the parades in Tianamen Square and we could almost feel the presence of the corageous individual who stood in front of the tanks!"
We had a few hours to explore and it was well worth going. Our concierge (Navigator Jefferson Li) at the Renaissance Wangfujing arranged for the purchase of our tickets ahead of time as you need tickets in advance. We were also informed of two windows to go as they try to spread out the amount of tourists going. When we got there we opted for the audio earpiece self guided tour which was well worth it! We felt that we didn't need someone and we were right. The Forbidden City is a must do if in Beijing!
I spent 3 hours there and could have spent more time .so many areas to see and discover. I had an amazing tour guide that gave me the history of this place as we walked around. Spectacular buildings .if you are interested in the history of China I highly recommend for you to go .
"Main reason of our Beijing trip. Well maintained, waiting time was within limits. It was busy, but doable. We didn’t manage to see everything in one afternoon.

In the evening they closed the exit to Tiananmen square. No announcement or signs until you get there, we walked 30 minutes for nothing, be aware."
"In Beijing, you must visit the Forbidden city. It will take from 2 hours to a full day depending on how much you want to visit. The site is very large and some of the museum room can be a little hard to find so plan so extra time."
"Area is huge, always crowded, full of tourists, you can feel the history of China, you can take a lot of photos for beauty of buildings, but you need to walk too much, so wear comfortable shoes."
We went in the morning before lunch and the crowds were already dense. Be aware you must go through security with your passport before entering actual attraction. It is confusing if you do not speak Chinese to find out where you can buy tickets (the far right corner when entering the courtyard before entrance). Overall a lot of walking but an amazing experience lots of old buildings and history!
Be prepared to walk but if you're a traveller that is into learning about the history of places you visit and admire local architecture that reflects that place's culture this place is filled with stories. Unforgettable. Try and get a local guide for a more informed experience.
The palace is really really really big and spacious. You need a lot of walking and you will easily get lost as each of the exterior design look almost the same except the sign board infront of each palace. Too crowded with tourist and they only open a door size space for you to peep in the internal of the palace hall. With peoples squeeze and pushing all the times is really difficult to get a good look at the internal part of the palace. I only manage to take some photo outside of the palace hall bearing the name of the hall with peoples around me.
"A visit once your life, is a must such as the Great Wall. Both characterized the Chinese civilization and culture. Magnificent hot spot and very crowded. You need to spend almost an hour and half."
"Well worth a visit, wear comfortable walking shoes as this place is enormous. Our ""trip a deal"" tour guide had excellent knowledge and was very informative - interesting life of past Emperors and their concubines!!!"
"If you like History and Chinese culture, you will need to visit this place. You can see where King Sleep and where King throne is. Just a must place to visit when you are in beijing and most of the tour agency will bring you here."
"Be prepared to walk long distances. The place is vast and at a scale that most westerners might not be prepared for or expect. Yes it is very grand, but becomes rather repetitive as you pass from one vast courtyard to the next and from one palace to the next.
Best to go with a guide who can explain the differences in each building and point out important detail that could be missed."
"Been there few month ago and we really enjoyed that historic place. First, if you are not with a guide, remember to take your passport otherwise you’ll can have one more ride to your hotel. The place was crowded but we can still breath and didn’t feel oppressed. There are so many things to see that you’ll need few hours to visit."
"The security check was very tight on the day of our travel. The queue to go through the security check was long. We start our Visit at Tiananmen square. Then, use the underground walkway to cross over to the forbidden city. We bought the entrance ticket at the ticket counter which was open for foreign tourists only, and it was fast. After visited the forbidden city, we cross over to the Jingshan Park. Take a short climb up to the hill for the overall view of the forbidden city."
This place is so big and after a while started to get a bit jaded. Don't need to see every section inside the walls as it blurs into one.
"We combined this with Tiananmen Square (as would most people logically).
It is a series of palaces and building built on an epic scale and with breathtaking beauty. It is truly lovely to look at.
What is not so nice are the crowds. We were there early but it really doesn't matter what time you arrive. The raising of the national flag in Tiananmen Square attracts many thousands of Chinese visitors shortly after dawn and there just isn't a quiet spell after that. Not the Forbidden City anymore. More the over-run City.
At times the site is also closed or at least partially closed to facilitate VIP visitors. `It really is worth checking up beforehand as this seems to happen at least once a week most of the year. The week before we attended most of the palace and square was closed for the Chinese Communist Party Congress and then for the visit of a VIP from Russia. Whilst we were there the barriers were going in and additional checkpoints were being set up for Trumps visit. Security is very intrusive and creates massive long queues but - hey ho- thats the world we live in now."
The forbidden city was ok but is very overrated. It was very commercialized and things are over priced. Not saying don’t go just lower expectations a bit.
"I was fortunate to have a guide and driver to help me navigate my way around Beijing - thank you Trailfinders

This pace is huge, and I mean huge.......

The architecture is stunning and there is so much to look at. I could have spent the whole day here meandering around but with only a short time to spend in Beijing, having walked around Tianaman Square already and the Summer Palace to following we just hit the highlights.

It was busy, very busy and impossible to take any pictures without people in!

Again so much to see, look at, absorb and process. As with so much in China it is overwhelming and stunning and beautiful.

So much of the history to try and process and absorb as well as the cultural side of so many things.

Well worth the visit.

The photos are just a tiny snapshot of what there is to see"
If your in Beijing you can’t miss this - it’s a must see! It does get very busy here and you need to think about the time of year you visit! The temperature in summer can be quite high plus the air pollution may be an issue - having said that it’s an extremely interesting look into China’s past.
"This is obviously a must see when visiting Beijing. I would strongly recommend going a little earlier, although you will still need to contend with large tour groups... also I’d avoid going on even a slightly rainy day like we did as the sites will be drowned in umbrellas as you can see!

There are amazing little things seen here which you will see across a lot of the buildings in Beijing. *Hint look at the corners of the roofs and count the animals*

We took the audio tour Guide which was really informative and gave a lot of info and gave you a nice light indication on the map of where you have already been. Although, we still got lost multiple times. One things we didn’t get is a through ticket which I would also recommend as a lot of exhibitions will be closed throughout and the cost will add up quickly if you were to do them all."
A bit disappointed. This place is huge but don’t take too much of your time if you are visiting there. Most of the places are inaccessible and you must to get an audio guide. But the crowds are really. Annoying and you practically don’t enjoy your visit... the best for me is the view from outside
"The Forbidden City is a very busy attraction, which I found off putting. I found there are great views of the city from Beihai park, this is just over the road and can be entered for a small fee. If you walk to the top of the hill you get a great 'birds eye' view of the Forbidden City and surrounding areas."
"The venue is located in the heart of Beijing and the very famous Tianmen square. Parking is not possible there. The security measures are tight, no entering, normally without passport. The queues can be long on the typical Chinese holidays. The area is huge, to cover it all, you need to walk a lot. Take a guided tour or an electronic guide, otherwise it can get boring."
"This is a majestic palace. I have been to this venue many times and it has become much more crowded, hence it is advisable to avoid the weekends and public holidays. Previously it was only a short walk from the car-parking to the main entrance but with crowd control, it has become a long walk from the car-parking in Tiananmen Square to the main entrance. There is also a security check gate. The palace has not changed since my visit many years ago, although in walking to the main entrance I passed the decorated Tiananmen Square and saw the motorcade of D. Trump who was visiting Beijing at that time."
"Definitely a sight to see. The palace is beautiful and huge. We took a guided tour of this place so it was nice getting to learn all about the history about the location and the emperors who used to live there. Would definitely recommend visiting. Just be prepared for lots of people and crowds. I would recommend using a tour guide or somehow preordering tickets, as our tour guide got us straight in past the long long line to get in."
"The Forbidden City attached to Tianamin Square is large and impressive, but if I am honest a bit boring really, however it is a must see because of the history. Our guide Jin from Webjet tours explained quite a lot. It was our first day in Beijing and we were a little tired from our journey to get to China, so perhaps we were still coming to grips with everything. We did feel as if we were being ""watched"" the whole time, as much for your safety because what are you really going to do.The Forbidden City seemed a little humble, but as I said it is a must see whilst in China.
A place for anyone to visit, we did it with Webjet and I would recommend it to anyone."
"Without the audio guide tour, it's just an empty palace. Knowing the history is a must. Most of the furnishing are gone but still an amazing place to visit."
My tour guide Laura from chinahighlights.com was really informative. She taught me so much during the tour their. Laura shared with me the reasoning behind why the palace was set up the way it was and little details that made it so memorable.
"A Chinese friend recommended this place as a must seen... definitely we recommend to be here and take as many pictures as you can, it is beautiful, full of history and amazing typical Chinese touristic place"
"We have toured many historical places, but got turned off and left.
Why? One reason is the crush of people. Tian'anmen and the Forbidden City are probably TOO popular. And we attempted to visit in low season on a cold, non-holiday, non-weekend day. Just sooooooooooooooo many people.
Reason number two simply has to do with security. I quit counting the cameras, or the number of times our backpacks were inspected and x-rayed, or what I felt was the overpower presence of military and police. Perhaps this has something to do with a certain time from back in the very late 80s, but it was just unsettling.
I have decided that there is so much more to see in China that is not so politicized.
We enjoyed the trip to the Great Wall, the Temple of Heaven and even the awesome efficiency of the Beijing subway system so much more than this."
"We went on a Sunday morning and there were already a huge number of tourist groups entering the Meridian Gate. But I think due to the vast area of the Palace grounds, I seldom feel the crowd.
The clock gallery requires an additional 10RMB to visit but the exhibition is good."
"The Forbidden City attached to Tianamin Square is amazing. China is such a surprise despite the whole past of oppression the people are so friendly. Yes you are watched, as much for your safety because what are you really going to do.
Once again it is a humble building given Europe's opulence, it is huge and the history is amazing. This is a country that is somewhat miss-understood, it is more capitalist than Australia. A place for anyone to visit, did it with Nexus Holidays and I would recommend it to anyone."
"This being a must see place for all the people of China and the world for that matter ... one must learn to push people out of your way. Just like at Christ the redeemer statue in Rio de Janeiro.

The beauty of the tour comes at the end when you enter the living quarters and the garden. Make sure to bring extra batteries for your camera."
The grounds of the Forbidden City are quite extensive and full of beautifully restored and maintained buildings. Allow a lot of time to explore the many buildings and learn its history. There is so much to learn about the different dynasties and the signifigance of the most minute detail.
"Most of it was just a large blank space. The temples were amazing but the historical value to the location added most of the enjoyment, the rest was to be frank, quite boring.

I would visit just for the experience but wouldn't recommend spending much time here at all."
"As a lover of history who has been reading a fair bit of history lately, it was really amazing to walk on the same spot as the same people I had just been reading about.
Tips, buy your tickets online, that way you just need to show your passport. Also when you enter through Tiananmen Square, you cannot leave through there, you must go through the North Gate or the East Gate."
"We spent about 3 hours in the city, entering through the Meridian Gate walking north to exit via the Gate of Divine Prowess. The fine detailed architecture is stunning and contains so much history. An unforgettable experience."
"If ever you are in Beijing, this is the place you need to see. Different from anything else. At different time of day, different seasons of the year, you will see different things. Just amazing. No matter how many times you've been to the place, there is always something new to discover. And, don't forget to say hello to the roaming cats within the palace."
Definitely a “must see” when in Beijing! Reserve at least three hours to tour this expansive site. A guide would certainly be helpful as well as an advance reservation to avoid lengthy lines at the entrance.
"This was a big tourist attraction but it all looked the same and it was most crowded tourist attraction! We stayed 10 days in China and this was a pretty neat place to see. To be honest, this wasn’t my favorite!"
I got a first hand VIP view of the Forbidden City because of my job. It is a beautiful place full of cultural history. I highly recommend visiting this location while in Beijing.
We only had a couple of hours. It was not enough to take it fully in but long enough to get a feel for how amazing this place really is. Beautiful architecture and artistic creations. Highly recommend a tour guide so that you don’t miss the history while exploring.
"Spent four hours at the Forbidden City, take the side entrance. Well worth getting the audio guide. Make time for the clock museum it is very unique. The major court areas can be very crowded so take your time. The side court areas through the various gates have surprisingly few people exploring these areas. Well worth the time as then you have the space to appreciate the the grandeur and the architectural elements of the Forbidden City."
"This must be the greatest place we have ever visited. It's so overwhelming that it is difficult to describe. Take a plane and go there. There are not enough words to describe this enormous and beautiful palace. Unique, great, superb, historical, huge, superior craftsmanship, perfect harmony etc."
"My husband was lecturing at various universities in Beijing over a two week period. As an archaeologist we were lucky enough to be given a personal guided tour of this amazing place.
They only allow 80,000 visitors a day which gives you an understanding to how vast this place is.
Home to 24 emperors and set in the heart of the city. The largest palace complex in the world. Over 800 buildings and 9000 rooms. So much to see, the Hall of Supreme Harmony, the ceramics gallery but don’t miss the Nine Dragon Screen, used to protect the Hall of Imperial Supremacy. One day is not enough! Should be one of the wonders of the world!

The minute details in these bui;ldings and the cleanliess is mind blowing... history made current - Wow
The Forbidden city is full of history and amazing stuctures. Beginning Oct 2017 you are supposed to buy tickets online but you can get away by buying it on the right side ticket booths designed for walk up sales. You are supposed to have your passport but one of us forgot but was able to use the drivers license. There are so many buildings and will take at least a few hours to attempt to see them all. People can be pushy so hold your ground. Earphone guides can be rented and aren't too expensive. If you're really into the history of it and want to spend the whole day there then I would recommend renting them.
"The scale of the forbidden city is amazing. The construction techniques and its antiquity are awe inspiring. Allow a lot of time for your visit.
Tip the 4 star toilets are the best."
We walked from Tiananmen Square to the Forbidden City. Red is the dominant color everywhere. The Imperial Palace is a very large complex of buildings and concrete. You don't notice any green until the end when you walk through the gardens. Be prepared for the crowds. It was probably the busiest place we visited in Beijing. You walk under a large portrait of Chairman Mao as you enter the complex. There are so many buildings and hard to see it all but the highlights are worth walking around. Be prepared to take your life in your own hands when you walk up to some of the buildings to get views. People are very aggressive and pushy and there is no lines to view things.
"Go early! And bring your passport. You need it to buy tickets.

If you get there when they open, it'll still look busy because of all the tour buses. The tours B line down the center. Stay away from them, there's tons to see from the sides and balconies looking down. We were treated to a private experience by staying away from the tour groups and their loud speakers."
"The complete forbidden city is one huge museum. But they charge you extra for the palace museum.
it is only 20 Yuan but it is not very special."
"It's large and impressive. The architecture of the roofs was interesting. The more animal carvings on the roof the more important the building. Two areas where you had to be pushy, but otherwise very spacious. Another great part of China's history."
"Forbidden city its a must go place. Lots of history and unique views , mostly during fall season. Great experience!"
"We have all seen pictures of the Forbidden City. It is on the Terraces that the officials watch the Military Parade. However none of these pictures really do the ""City"" justice. It is very large. Much larger than I expected, with some 1800 rooms. History has affected the Forbidden City as most of the real Treasures are now in Taiwan as Chiang Kai-shek took all the Treasures to protect them and they have never been returned. This is unfortunate but the structures are amazing.

There is a lot of walking in the Forbidden City and if you have mobility issues a Wheel Chair and person to push it can be hired, relatively cheaply. There are still steps at the base of the large gates to keep the ""evil spirits"" out that have to be negotiated. Men should step over these with their left leg and women their right - women are always right?

There were a lot of people and noise at the Forbidden City so our guide provided us with head sets (for a few Yuan} that allowed us to hear about the City and this kept us all together so that was an additional benefit.

All around a great day."
"Six hundred years of history, just under 200 acres inside its walls, nearly 10,000 rooms. The seat of the Dragon Throne until 1912 is a must see place in Beijing. So much to see and learn about the buildings, the emperors, empresses, and the others who lived and died there. With so much to see, there is much you might miss, secrets that might not be revealed. Unless you have way more time than me to research and visit, I recommend a tour such as Lily's Discovery Tour. In 5 hours, Lily showed me places I wouldn't have seen and taught me things I wouldn't have learned without her. And we bypassed the lines! As much as I saw and learned, I'll visit again."
"Forbidden City was outstanding and takes up about 170 acres. It has 9,999 rooms or some say 8,984 according to our guide! Nevertheless, we saw all we could and it’s an impressive work of art. Nice gift shops and bathrooms. Also some lovely tea shops if a break is needed. Built over 600 years ago, there is history on every corner. From the Grand Hall to the Emperors residence, it was beautiful!"
"What more can it be said about this place, from the magestuosity of the site to its size, gardens, and history is a maze of stories woven in time. Don't judge it, just appreciate the fact that you are there."
"This attraction just seems to go on and on, with wonderful palaces and temples adorned with attractive marble carvings. You need to visit this and see for yourself, my vocabulary is too narrow to describe"
"We've visited the Forbidden City today (because it was closed for Trump yesterday) and we were shocked by how many people were already there at 8:30 when the ticket offices are opening.
Most of the Chinese tourists were just interested in the emperor's palace only, so we can recommend checking out the sides (particularly right). It was great to see such an historic place, but overall we considered it a ""must-see because it used to be important"" but not a ""breathtaking must-see"".

Info: The map of the Forbidden City in the Lonely Planet travel guide are not 100% correct."
"History, history, history. Forbidden City is a must see. Go first thing when it opens to avoid the massive crowds. Start on one side, take the mini tram and get picked up at the exit"
The palace museum is awesome. Chinese artifacts of any and alltypes. Another ancient classic building that has survived the ravages of time. Highly recommended.
"Really enjoyed my visit to the Forbidden city and Tiananmen square. It's very crowded,so there may be some queuing. It's a good idea to bring a folding umbrella with you,it's handy when it's raining and when you need to be shielded from the sun."
"Had the pleasure of visiting this historical masterpiece. Was warned by friends in Sydney about crushing crowds but we attended between Xmas and new year, during Beijing winter and clearly a low visitor time. Next to no crowds so could really immerse and read the many boards explaining the role and development of the Forbidden City over the centuries. If visiting at busy times, just be patient."
"Allow yourself time to get into the Forbidden City as the ticket queues can take time. Also take some food and drink. While there are restaurants and drink outlets they are spread out.
This place is huge and only as part of it is open to the public. The thing to remember that it was all build by hand and the artisans who crafted it were highly skilled. Sure it may have been stripped of a part of its heritage content but this is still one of the worlds great sights and sites. Explore some of the areas off to the side and no need to take a tour or guide as it is fun just wandering around looking. There are some interesting museums on site and visualizing how a cloistered society operated within the palace confines is intriguing.
Sure you could rush straight through in a matter of a couple of hours, but if you take your time, rest under trees in a side garden, and wander the back alleys, you can absorb the place away from the tourist crowds."
The Forbidden City was one of the most interesting and profound experiences of my trip to China. It can be a bit overwhelming and vast yet impressive at the same time. Plan to spend at least a half day exploring all it has to offer. From the museums/galleries and beautiful architecture. The earlier or later you go will be less crowded. Wouldn't miss this opportunity while visiting Beijing.
"This is a must see if you are in Beiging. Allow about 2 to 3 hours to visit this site, it is large with many buildings to look into."
The Forbidden City is huge. Wear good shoes and be prepared to walk for hours. the buildings are amazing and there is symbolism in every statue and everything you see. I hope your tour guide is as good as our Nexus guide was as there is so much information to absorb and he was very knowledgeable and experienced. Bring plenty of water as it is a big day.
"I visited in an afternoon. Overwhelming locals. The place is steeped with history. Would better appreciate the place and it’s history if there were a guide or audio guide as the place is very very big.

Do cater time for security checks. At least half an hour."
Vast place with extensive history. The Chinese architecture is really amazing which take care of minute details for the gigantic structures. The history tells how different the views and beliefs of people were there long back compared to today's. The idea of the symmetry is worth mentioning.
"Maybe I'm unique, but I thought the Forbidden City was a lot of the same thing. There's no question this is a BIG place, which is impressive and I'm glad I saw it, but each time I entered an inner city it looked the same as the previous one....and this also applied to the outer courtyards. One thing I didn't appreciate is they try to nickel-and-dime you to death with their exhibit buildings - the Clocks building was interesting, but I didn't waste time or money on their ""Treasures"" building."
"This is an enormous complex with, to me, a similar style, so I had difficulty specifically identifying my photos afterwards. Beautiful, gilt, impressive, jammed, combines architecture with small heirlooms. I ended shooting the attached picture from atop a hill across the room (there is a temple there), and the overview was a better introduction than the ear-guide provided -- I wished I had started with it. Building after building, arranged as they were used, with exemplary artifacts, and each empty of inhabitants. We were a little like gawkers at ruins of a neighbor's mansion."
Incredible to see in person. It was great to have a driver and Shirley our tour guide from Wild China!
"This is a must see in anyone's books.
Advice....get there really early. They say 100,000 people a day visit. We got there just after it opened and there were already a fair number of people around. By the time we left there were huge amounts.
It is as astonishing and beautiful as imagined. Do make a point of exploring the side areas as well as the main buildings. There are times when there are very few people around in the side areas. There were also exhibitions of ceramics and clocks.
So glad we went."
"Went here on our China tour.

This is an enormous complex with massive elaborate buildings, carvings etc. It was interesting to see they could do all of this so long ago when modern machines did not exist. As an example huge carved slabs of marble were used on ice.

This clearly shows the wealth, veneration and power of previous emperors. Building after building, each huge and ornately decorated.

A must see in Bejing"
"For us the Forbidden City complex was fascinating. While there aren't that many rooms visible to tourists, the architecture and complexity of the site were most interesting to us. We particularly loved the trees in the Dragon Lady's portion of the complex."
Need to have a whole day to appreciate this place and absorb the history. The Chinese government did a good job preserving their history and culture. We did the layover tour but would appreciate more time in this place.
"This place is massive.
It is so worth the visit.
It is so clean and still used.
So many impressive buildings.
The history is fascinating.
So clever were these people.
The attention to detail is amazing.
Well worth the trip alone."
"This is a must see when visiting China. The history is mind blowing. It was home to some 245 Emperors for nearly 500 years. It was completed in 1420 and is the world's largest palace complex on 250 Acres, with 9999 rooms, protected by a 20 foot wide moat and a 32 foot high wall, it is an amazing attraction to experience. You go into this ""yesterday world"" when walking through the many sections of the City.
It is suggested that you take sufficient water and some food to eat. This is an ancient relic and , whilst it has been restored in many places, it remains very much as it was. It has not been ""westernised"" with food outlets. ( A good thing, as the integrity of the site is being maintained).
All that can really be recommended is go there and experience it for yourself. You won't be disappointed. A must to tick off your bucket list."
"This was maybe not the most exciting place to visit, but with the important regards role this play in the history of the country, a place one should stop by.

Great view of the square her, but be aware that you go out on the back towards the Forbidden City - so if you also plan to see the square, do that first"
From the chaos of getting tickets to getting in the door and hiring English translation head sets which seemed to always be out of sync to where we were in the city we found the whole experience very over rated. Possible we were tired so didn't fully appreciate the history of the place but it seemed to go on and on like an Ikea store with no way to get out!
"Great history and culture. When you are in China, must see Forbidden city the palace museum. Highly recommended"
"You will want to have a guide who is knowledgeable about the Palace. It is a fascinating place. Tickets can be purchased ahead of time. If you are visiting during a busy time, tickets will be sold out, thus buy them ahead of time. The Palace is well maintained. If you are there during a busy time be ready to be swarmed with people. You will need to be assertive to get to where you want to take pictures if it is busy. The Palace is right downtown Beijing. Tiananmen Square is directly across the street. The subway system is easy to use and will drop you off close to the entrance."
"Enjoyed the first hour including Tiananmen Square then Forbidden City. Very tight security and line up to long.
Needed better organization knowing big China election also in City.
Too much waljing6of similar building to just look thru Windows in most cases but gardens etc worth spending time.
Lots of history but..."
"The scale of the Forbidden Palace is truly awe inspiring, from the moment you walk through the Meridian gate to gaze at The Gate of the Supreme Harmony leading to the Harmony and Purity halls beyond.
I agree with others that it’s not too long before you get historic wooden structure overload and the real interest to the history of the Forbidden City is how all these different areas were used by the emperor and the various members of the royal court during the years of the various dynasties and for this you really need a guide as there isn’t that much information available on plaques around the various sections of the Forbidden City.
This is very relevant for the smaller palaces radiating East and West from the Palace of Earthly Tranquillity as there are a lot of interesting ones hidden here that you could miss without a guide. And then just when you’ve seen everything you come across the Imperial Garden and the excellent Hall of Imperial Peace just before you exit.
Yes it can get very crowded but there is an advantage in the one way system as you move from the Meridian Gate through the City to exit through the Spiritual Valor Gate, in that if you get stuck behind a large tour group, just hang back a while and wait for them to move on."
Excellent our guide Ivan was great with his knowledge on the place a long walk through the city was full of historical facts & sights that any one would enjoy.
"A visit to the Forbidden City is a must when in Beijing. Our guide, Tom, from China a Odyssey provided invaluable historical information about this site. Highly recommended."
"The Forbidden City

Beijing, China, used to be home of the nation’s emperor. He lived in the forbidden city: a huge palace, built especially for him. He lived there with his his wives and servants. The palace was used from the Ming-dynasty in 1420 until the Qing-dynasty in 1912. It was also a political center for the government for almost 500 years. Now, the palace is a museum, established in 1925. These days, they have up to 14 million visitors each day!
The building is designed by architect Kuai Xiang. The palace is also a UNESCO world heritage site.
The palace, constructed from 1406 to 1420, consists of 920 buildings and covers 72 hectares. The palace is built in the traditional Chinese palatial architecture and has influenced a lot of other architectural projects in China. The palace was declared a UNESCO world heritage site in 1987 and one the largest ancient wooden structures. The palace is named “the Forbidden City” because no one was allowed into the city except for the servants and wives of the emperor, the emperor himself and politicians.

The city is built in a rectangle, 961 meters from north to south and 753 from east to west. It consists of 920 buildings and has 8,886 rooms. The Forbidden City was designed to be the centre of the ancient, walled city of Beijing. It is enclosed in a larger, walled area called the Imperial City. The Imperial City is, in turn, enclosed by the Inner City; to its south lies the Outer City. The Forbidden City is still important to this day to Beijing. The central north–south axis remains the central axis of Beijing. The axis extends to the south through Tiananmen gate to Tiananmen Square, the ceremonial centre of the People's Republic of China. To the north, it extends through Jingshan Hill to the Bell and Drum Towers. This axis is not perfectly aligned north–south, but is slightly tilted by two degrees. Researchers now believe that the axis was designed in the Yuan dynasty to be aligned with Xanadu, the other capital of their empire.

The Forbidden City is surrounded by a 7.9 metres high city wall and a 6 metres deep by 52 metres wide moat. The walls are 8.6 metres wide at the base, tapering to 6.6 metres at the top. These walls served both as defensive walls and walls for the palace. They were constructed with a soil core and surfaced with three layers of baked bricks. At the four corners of the walls are towers. These towers used to be the most visible to the commoners so there exists a lot of folklore about them. Each wall has a gate: at the southern end is the main Meridian Gate, to the north is the Gate of Divine Might. The east and west gates are called the ""East Glorious Gate"" and ""West Glorious Gate"". All gates in the Forbidden City are decorated with golden door nails, except for the East Glorious Gate.

The Forbidden City is divided into two parts. The Front Court was used for ceremonial purposes. The Inner Court includes the northern sections, and was the residence of the Emperor and his family. Generally, the Forbidden City has three vertical axes. The most important buildings are situated on the central one.

Religion was an important aspect of the lives of people in the imperial court. In the Qing dynasty, the Palace of Earthly Harmony became a place of ceremonies. There are two Taoist shrines, one in the imperial garden and another in the central area of the Inner Court.
Another form of religion in the palace was Buddhism. A number of temples and shrines were scattered throughout the Inner Court, including that of Tibetan Buddhism or Lamaism. The Pavilion of the Rain of Flowers is one of the most important. It housed a large number of Buddhist statues, icons, and mandalas, placed in ritualistic arrangements.

The Forbidden City is surrounded by imperial gardens. To the north is Jingshan Park, also known as Prospect Hill, an artificial hill created from the soil excavated to build the moat and from nearby lakes. It has three temples on the top.
To the west lies Zhongnanhai, a former royal garden centred on two connected lakes. It now serves as the central headquarters for the Communist Party of China and the State Council of the People's Republic of China. To the south of the Forbidden City were two important shrines – the Imperial Shrine of Family or the Imperial Ancestral Temple and the Imperial Shrine of State or Beijing Shejitan.

I really loved visiting the beautiful palace. It was very impressive to see the buildings and squares. It was truly a big palace: after we visited the palace we climbed the Prospect Hill. From there you could really see how large the palace really was. It was a beautiful sight to see. When walking through the palace you walk through a building to a square, and then through a building again to a square, and to a building again, so on. Each time buildings and squares get bigger and bigger. It kent Boeing surprises about the size of the city. It was really impressive.The architectural style was really pretty: there was a lot of winged roofs and red walls. I really recommend visiting the Forbidden City, it's a one in a lifetime thing and I definitely think that if you have the opportunity you should visit it."
"Perhaps the main chinese attraction of them all. Impressive, massive, great first stop to then understand the rest of the culture and visits.

Emperor rules all."
"Growing up loving Chinese culture and watching kung fu movies, it was always a dream to see the Forbidden City... It is awesome to see all the history and beautiful architecture and artwork..."
"Enjoy the self-guided tour of the Forbidden City Palace and Gardens. Incredible views, architecture dating back to the 1400s. Plan on lots of walking and tour at least 2-4 hours."
"The forbidden city was probably the highlight of our trip. We went on one of the busiest days during Golden Week so we faced some ques getting in but once inside the crowds dispersed.

Trying to buy a ticket was a task in itself and I wish we had seen the tips in a previous review. Just walk through the arch under the painting of Mao and keep straight ahead, through the security checks and again straight ahead. You will get to a point where you can go no further having passed the tourist or visitor information to your left. In the far right hand corner, under a grey tile roof is a very discreet ticket office for foreign visitors with passports. Probably the one with no ques whatsoever! The entrance styles are now behind you.

Once inside we were overwhelmed by just how expansive the city is. Vast square after squares stretches out ahead of you and you wonder if its ever going to end and the detail on every object or surface is amazing whether its a step or roof tile. Whilst you can touch just about everything you can see it a shame that some people have clearly caused damage to door furniture and tiles.

There are a few cafe restaurants inside and ice cream carts. We just grabbed a chicken burger and sat in the hidden garden near the far exit watching the world go by.

We made our way there via the metro which was really easy. We didn't use a guide or audio guide and found the signage sufficient enough for our needs."
"A huge palace complex that looks awesome and colorful (red dominates as in all traditional Chinese buildings). The palace doesn't display much pomp (compared to ones in say India or Thailand). But it is the vastness that inspires awe. You can expect to spend at least 2 hrs here to glance through. Not very stroller friendly as there steps in various places. This place looks impressive in pictures. Must visit.

P. S. Visited in March 2016"
Came here a long time back but this time with my wife. Very inspiring. We both used the museum style audio guide devices which worked very well and cost 40 Yuan each.
"The Forbidden City is a very large place, so be prepared to walk and climb stairs. They have overlaid the old stone steps with new wooden steps in many places to make walking up the stairs safer. Would recommend having a guide to explain the significance of all the buildings. There are rest room facilities on location and some shops."
"This is a big area. You can spend 30 minutes there, or all day wandering around. For me, about 1.5 hour was sufficient, as it starts to all look the same. It's a very big area, and the structures are amazing."
"We saw the Forbidden City with a private guide who was very knowledgeable in history, so I'm sure our experience was a little different than if we were to have gone on our own.

We spent about an hour or so in the Forbidden City, and only really saw about a quarter of it. I see how you could spend a good part of the day here, but there are not a lot of labels, so you'll need to bring a travel book with you to give you the history of the buildings, which were in good condition by the way.

Wear comfortable walking shoes and if you have time, explore the nearby Tiananmen Square, and Jingshan and BeiHai parks."
"After walking across Tiananmen Square our group were taken to the infamous Forbidden City with its palaces and courtyards, gardens and stepped staircases. Having just watched the movie some days before on one of the Chinese tv channels the story of the last emperor, one of twenty four Chinese emperors who lived there in unimaginable splendour , refreshed me on the history of the place. I am fairly un-schooled in the history of ancient China and to be advised by our guide of the history adds to the visit.
Huge crowds are to be expected and wear comfortable shoes as you are on the move all the time. Well worth a visit though and to be recommended."
"Great experience. Love the feeing of spaciousness. Compares very well with the other palaces worldwide. Getting in was a tough experience. Waited in the queue for an hour for the security check. Was poorly organised.i think if you go a bit later , the queue may not be so long.But not sure of this. Once inside, it was smooth sailing. The queue for the tickets also was small and this was well organised. Once inside, we felt the wait was worth it, although our thoughts were exactly the opposite while waiting. Spent almost the entire day here and then felt that we could do some more. Ate in the restaurant in the museum. This was also fun . The service was fast, the food was average. You are allowed to get your own food in, so can plan accordingly. Take your passport along to buy tickets. Don't listen to anybody who says that you have to book online. They have a limit of 80000, so you will be taking a chance, but if you go soon enough, there should be no trouble, unless you target the holidays, in which case, it is safer to book online. There is a racket on for booking tickets online, because you need a Chinese phone number . Our hotel staff wanted 30 yuan extra for one ticket. We did not use them, but took a chance."
"Amazing, but very tiring. The crowds are enormous and you have to fight your way to see anything. Lots of pushing and shoving."
"Contrary to what other travelers are suggesting - to go as early as possible due to big crowds and the number of people allowed in every day, it was stress free for us. we arrived at the forbidden city subway station around 10am, followed the crowds out, and there was a security to go through along the streets (it was during the 19th congress).
after that, there was a sea of chinese people walking towards tiananmen square.. so we started to freak out... and walked fast.. about 10 mins through the tiananmen square, you will have to walk about 10 mins in again. at this stage, you will need to keep your eyes open and watch out for a booth on your RIGHT, IN A CORNER, that is specially for foreign tickets purchase. there will be personnel to stop people from going in, you just need to show your passport to proof you are foreigner.
there will be no signs to guide you to the foreign booth for the first 20 mins walk. so you just need to keep a look out.

for me, i had 3G connection on my phone and i opened up some webpages with detailed explainations. it was really good as there are some stuffs around the museum which gave no explainations cept on internet. for eg, on the ground, there are big pieces of dragon carvings that are made from one piece of stones.
besides that, the imperial garden is a must visit. after that, you exit the palace grounds, and opposite you will be the Jingshan Park. take the underground passage and you will arrive there.
Once in Jingshan park, make your way to the top. a little climb, but the view is worth it. you get to see the forbidden city, and with the fog (or fog, it looks so mysterious)."
This is a lot of the same thing and it is very beautiful but good for about 2 hours at most and then it gets a bit boring.
Visiting the Forbidden City was one of those pinch me moments! Get yourself ready for LOTS of walking but every step is worth it. My advice is to make a whole day of the visit and go slow. There will be tons of tour groups rushing thru the place and at some points it will get crowed but I found if you are willing to sit and wait there will be times between groups that you can get a better view of the actual sites! Do rent a audio tour headset because there are very limited signs in the whole palace! Once you exit find a city bus to get transport back to a metro station or you can take a walk back to the nearest station!
"Here it is easy to understand better Chinese culture. Stress is put on hierarchy and authority. All buildings are carefully designed. Many small details and charming interiors to see.
I am not a specialist in China so 3 hours of walking was enough to get sufficient overview. I understand that for more advanced people the place will be attractive by more than 1 day.

I would recommend headphone guideline - works fine. Tickets are cheap. No passport presenting necessary.

Be careful with few things
- they sell daily up to 80.000 tickets so it is over-peopled place
- safety checking and ticket purchase can take some time
- there is no parking place nearby"
"Read some reviews which made it seem blah. I thought it was the most important thing to see. The size and wealth of this ""City"" really helps you understand the power of the Chinese dynasties. Most of the royal compounds throughout Asia are modeled on the City - just less grand."
"This place is huge, prepare for a long walk, on holidays it is impressive the amount of people that visit it, it is good to have a guided tour to know the details of the place. It has a lot of history and culture. It is a place you must visit"
The Forbidden city will consume about half a day to tour. Be sure to take your passports to purchase tickets! It is inexpensive and truly an amazing glimpse into ancient China dynasties. Most buildings predate Columbus discovering America. As you walk through layer by layer of the city which housed the rulers and elite it is truly a step back in time.
"Forbidden City-The Palace Museum - One of the top destination in the city, is really worthwhile to visit."
"Getting tickets is tedious. There are 2 ways - queue up at onsite (require passport) to the right of the entrance (which according to other reviews requires an early start) or purchase online. The caveat to the later is that u need a local mobile phone to do that, but the way around that is to get ur hotel to do it (which they charged us an extra 10rmb). I reckon it’s worth the extra cost as u r then guaranteed entry without queuing for a ticket (queuing for security and entrance still required - total 20 minutes for us on a weekday at 11am), as long as u enter b4 noon for a morning ticket. Remember to bring your passport/ID.

As for the actual palace, I really don’t understand others saying it is repetitive. Seriously, that is the architecture of the period, so why would one have different styles?!? The difference is in the intricate details to the buildings, like the number of beasts at the roof edges and the tiers/ eves of roofs in different grade buildings. There was an especially enjoyable exhibition called “we all live in the forbidden city” in the palace of great benevolence which was educational for young and old alike, which is well worth the effort.

Tip: stay til the last hour before closing time and the crowds will have thinned enough to experience the true grandeur of the place. I even managed to take several photos with no people in them."
You cannot tell how large an area this is just from the pictures. When you enter the Forbidden City you really get a glimpse into the past. It is truly an amazing journey through China's imperial history and a site that should not be missed.
The most interesting beutiful amazing place that you can be and see in Beijing. It takes many hours to tour the forbidden city and no place is compered to it. you walk there and ask all the time- how can all this was made only for one emprer and how many people where working for how long to make this amazing city. If you go to Beijing its no. 1 place you should go to.
"Staying in Beijing there are two places where the visit is mandatory, Forbbiden City is one of them. Four hours of visit is the minimun time to spend there. I also reccomend two different visits, during the day and at night! Full of amazing history!"
"This was my 4th or 5th visit over the past 20 years. Always awe-inspiring experience. Only downside on this occasion was the length (and slowness) of the security queue outside Tiananmen-East subway gate. This was probably on account of the National Congress meetings being held at the time, nonetheless the slow, cramped queue took well over an hour to move."
It is a short walk away from Tiannamen Square. It is a huge complex but only a small part of it can be visited. It would be better if visitors were allowed to explore further inside to really appreciate the place.
"Great place so rich in culture and history, a must in China's historical lessons. This place is overwhelming BIG so be prepared to walk allot, it's like it never ends."
I was fascinated by the absolutely huge courtyard which has 15 layers of bricks to prevent enemies from tunneling in to assassinate the emperor. 500 years of history.
"We spent a week in Beijing and the summer palace was the most worthwhile attraction. It is easy to access by subway and is absolutely beautiful. It can be visited with only a few hours to spare, but it is certainly worth setting aside an afternoon to see it properly.
Be sure to visit the south and north sides of the central hill. The north gate is equally interesting. Also take some time to explore the park areas to the west after venturing across the bridges.
Certainly worth the visit!!"
"A visit to the Forbidden City in Beijing should definitely be on everyone's list of historic places to experience. Just the size of the structures and complex itself was overwhelming. It would have been stunning to have actually seen more of the splendor of by-gone eras replicated in place throughout the complex, but seeing many artifact in the museum had to suffice. Much of the Forbidden City simply resembled large, ornate and often open structures. The complex was overall impressive but repetitive to the point of eventually becoming tedious. That said, a visit is a must."
"While this is clearly a place for tourists, there is so much to see and enjoy that one should not leave Beijing until spending a good deal of time there. Be careful of one element: being a Westerner, true for everywhere in Beijing and elsewhere, makes one a target for knowledgeable and engaging people looking to draw one in to a particular spot. We did see a display of art and calligraphy, and of course ended up buying something, and had a bit more to see as a result of the outer court, but one should be cautious. There were just the two of us, and I will add that despite the ""apparent distraction"", never felt in danger or ""abused"". Major point: bargain! Especially in taking a rickshaw: Prices are easily doubled, if not tripled, for Westerners, and one should offer a very low price (almost embarrassingly so) to insure a refusal of your offer, then come a bit."
"Make sure you get there early, bring your passport, and bring your comfortable walking shoes. We enjoyed our time at the Forbidden City, but there are just SO many buildings. The place is absolutely huge and there isn't a lot of information once you are inside of the palace so this is one place where a guide or at minimum the audio guide would be very helpful."
"If you do not have internet to book the tickets - just buy it at a counter nearby the entrance of the palace (I was lucky as I asked around because other people/locals were busy buying the tickets via their phone). Its a very long walk with scenic view. If you want to exit the palace, make sure you do not exit at the entrance back! You can't! Just exit at the South or West or East Gates. Otherwise its a very long u turn back"
"very Beautiful interesting and fascinating mainly to those interested in ancient Chinese culture. Recommend to visit with tour guides for explanations about the site

"As of October 2017, the Palace Museum has capped their number of visitors to 80,000 per day. While it may seem like your chances of being included in that large number are high, take a peek at Jingshan park and you'll notice that the grounds are confetti-ed with tourists trying to steal a taste of imperial life just like yourself. I was warned by friends who had made the trek into the heart of the city, then promptly turned around, ""book your tickets in advance."" Now you would think that such a tourist centric spot would have a more internationally friendly website, but...if you've been in Beijing for a few days already, you'll know that nothing is THAT easy. The website to buy your ticket is all in Mandarin. Surprise. There is a live chat box for assistance, but every step from inputing a passport number to the not so seamless pay options... will make you want to give up. Hopefully, when peak season hits again, they will have a translated site to navigate, otherwise, pack your passports and your determination (maybe some elbow pads too), and ask to be dropped off at the southern gate; Meridian Gate – Wumen. I got there at 3pm (check season for last entry) and after asking if I could purchase them on WeChat, the guards directed me to a special booth with other non China passport holders. At the end of the day, I finally got in, so told myself that I wouldn't complain on how exasperating the process was, but would simply share my experience online for future visitors. Basically- first check the site for an English update. If not, go to the booth and be persistent. Don't take no for an answer, that's how it works around here!"
"Worth to visit when you visit Beijing, you can see the history if China, very huge area, lots of tourists, really was a nice place"
"A must-do stop for sightseeing in Beijing, the Forbidden City is a massive sprawling site of palaces, gardens and concubine's pavilions. Wear comfortable shoes!
This is one site that is best seen with a tour guide - lots of significant facts and history that make the place come alive. E.g. number of gargoyles on the edge of the roof signifies importance of the individual, dragons with a baby dragon beneath it's paw are female, giant vats in the square were ancient fire-protection mechanisms, the empress was allowed to leave the city only once through the south gate, etc. Beautiful figurines in palace courtyards. Definitely worth the walk and a tour guide.
Enter from Tiananmen square gate and exit from the Palace North gate. Walk on Jingshan Front St to see the moat around the palace."
"This is really a vast site. Many impressive buildings and history. The interiors are difficult to see because of the crowds, and the buildings can seem a little repetitive, but this is a must see when in Beijing."
"We had a wonderful time visiting the forbidden city, amazing site. We took a private tour and our tour guide, Sophie Lee, was absolutely wonderful. She took care of all the logistics, tickets, private transportation, meals etc.. and she knows the history of the place, as well. Prepare for lots of walking as the site is huge but well worth the visit."
"You cannot visit Beijing and not go to the Palace Museum know as the Forbidden City. Take a tour guide as it's important you understand the reasons behind the various layers and gates to protect the Emperor and his family and to preserve the class structure. Be prepared for crowds.
We loved the Palace Garden."
"Hard to get in, if not by tour. Unbelievable big. Great impression of ancient china! Would go by tour as there a very few information written somewhere."
This historic site was awesome. I would not have learned as much were it not four our outstanding tour guide. Don’t see Beijing without her. She is the best!!!!!
Visiting this site with Cathy wS awesome. She explained everything thoroughly ! She made this trip to this historic site worth it!!!!
"If this was our first excursion in China we might have been more impressed. But after nearly a month in China, we couldn't help comparing it to all the other places we'd visited and felt underwelmed. We were told to arrive by 9.30am to secure our tickets as they only allow 80,000 people on per day. The queues moved quickly and it took us about 30min from the street until we got in. The first thing we noticed was the huge crowds. We avoided following tour groups and tried to find our own path through. Although there were some interesting exhibits overall we found the buildings and courtyards very monotonous. The gardens at the end were lovely, but so crowded that we couldn't find anywhere to enjoy them. To be honest we were glad to get out. But we really enjoyed our walk back to the city past the river and down the quiet treelined streets. "
Impressive place. Hard to believe it took only 4 years to build (plus 10 to plan and bring materials) with no nails or bolts. Spectacular.
Another place you need to see while in China. It is massive. Make sure you wear good walking shoes. It was overwhelming how big it was.
"I suggest a guided tour is a must, otherwise you'll just be looking at buildings and squares. The history behind most of what you're looking at is extensive and fascinating."
Very impressive- a must see! Very crowded and quite a lot of walking. It is a well worth a visit and has some beautiful features.
"For centuries the common folk were forbidden entry to this palace complex. No more. And the Chinese out of curiosity flock to see the innards of this site. For me perhaps having tramped around so many such historic sites, I was losing my enthusiasm I regret to say. But I was struck by the giant painting (not photo or poster) of Chairman Mao Zedong that adorns the Meridian Gate entry for Tiananmen Square. Go get more out of this than I could!"
This is another place that I do recommend seeing whilst in Beijing. It has many photo op spots and tons of history to learn about.
"Its a nice place to visit. But with their new implementation, if you are planning to visit there without tour, pls get your hotel to assist you to book tickets. They are only selling tickets via online starting of october . Because, the online ticketing only accepts alipay/wechat or china bank cards. No international cards which was the main hassle. Do bare in mind to give yourself more time to go through their bag checking.

You can take the train until tiananmen east and go through the security check."
"Because of traffic restrictions you start at Tianamen Square which is huge and was festooned for the Autumn Festival....an amazing place bordered by Mao's Mausoleum, the Great Hall of the People and the Forbidden City....The layers of the Forbidden City are long but each has its own special stories and seeing the Golden throne and the numerous concubine quarters evoked the scent of another time and place....very full of local tourists who displayed the same sense of awe as their foreign counterparts...good shoes a bottle of water a warm coat and a camera is all you need.....ending in the Empress' ornamental garden...well worth the long walk !"
This was a very good place to visit. please make sure you have good walking shoes on and a good guide. Karen was our guide and she was very friendly and very knowledgeable on everything.
"We visited at about 10 on a Friday morning in October and the queues to get through the first security were immense but they do move albeit slowly. There are toilets when you are through which are welcome if you’ve had lots of coffee for breakfast. Make sure you are in the right queue, one side of the road is for the National Museum, that for the Forbidden City is on the other. If you are non Chinese you can get your tickets at a window once inside the security entrance, remember to take your passport. Cost was 30 Yuen per person. The crowds are huge and it is often difficult to get close to the openings to see inside the buildings. You walk a long way so allow two hours and you end up at the back of the park, you cannot walk back again. It is then about a mile to the nearest metro station."
"On my first visit to this venue 24 years ago , it was a fabulous and magical palace of the great rulers of China. Now it has descended to an over-crowded unruly crowds of people pushing their way to any spot to take photos and blocking the few windows with displayed contents. My first visit had Chinese ladies dressed in old-fashioned attire showing us many interiors of the palace. This time there were none and were replaced by shops in various parts of the palace buildings selling tourist goods and foods etc. The shell of the palace remains, but the ""forbidden city"" is no more as every Chinese person and tourist can now venture in to admire the past splendours of the past rulers.
See it by all means but beware of the crowds."
"The forbidden city is a really impressive piece of work. I only spent about one and a half hour here, which is enough to get a feeling for the magnitude of the complex. I would recommend visiting it to everyone, but take your time if you want to see the expositions and buildings.
Be advised that it the queue for security checks can take very long (approx. 1hour end of October, probably longer in top season) but is is certainly worth waiting for!
Tickets can be purchased on site, walk all the way to the front, close to the ticket check at the right are a few counters to buy tickets. Make sure to bring your passport!"
We toured the Forbidden City with a guide and I would recommend the use of a guide as there is so much history to be learned. It takes about 2 hours to get around the City and there is quite a bit of walking so wear comfortable shoes.
My wife and I visited the forbidden city as part of our tour to Beijing this was an amazing experience don't miss thus if you come to Beijing
"It has a few pretty temples and massive concrete open spaces. I don't have much more to say. Getting through security, twice, s not worth it. Buy a postcard and so something else. Tianemen Square is equally pointless."
"I have always loved Qing History and this palace. Has always been my wish to visit this place after seeing dramas of this Era on TV everynow and then.
Finally visited this place in Oct this year.
The palace wasn't so well kept as to what I thought. Alot of artefects have been destroyed or stolen or taken to Taiwan. So basically we are just looking at an empty shell.
The furnitures inside are mostly replica.
A bit disappointed though, was hoping to see alot of things inside.
Majority of the artefacts are in Taiwan.
Palaces look glory on the outside but on the inside, they were actually quite run down.
Colours were coming off on the pillars and roofs of the palace.
They only touched up the colour on the exterior of the palace a little bit for olympics that time.
We hired a guide so all these were told to us by our private local guide."
"A must see attraction whenever you visit Beijing China. Amazing colours projected by the garden landscapes.
Amazing history shown through the sculptures and Tour guides knowledge."
the place is very historic and plan to take a lot of pictures.it is beautiful and have a guide to show you where the king lived and the guards lived. it's a city within a city. a hommage to communism
"Spent a whole day at the palace and still rushed at the end of the day. Lots of people on Sunday but the ticket purchase had been moved online . For passport holders, there is not a lot of time saved as one has to line up at the window to get the paper print out. Locals all use their ID to get in. Tried to see the special painting exhibit but did not get the ticket (2400 per day, a painting about the country). Rented an audio guide but it did not work out that well. Logged over 20k steps! Highly recommended. Ticket is 60 Yuan, opted for the treasure exhibit for 10 Yuan more. Needs a lot of walking and some history knowledge to fully enjoy."
Must see in Beijing. Years and years of story and 14 years only to build. Home for 24 emperors it’s a place full of magic and secrets.
This is one of the have to sees in Beijing. It is one giant temple looking building after another. The size is impressive as is the history of the emperors who lived there. Bring a pram with kids as there is lots of walking to do.
This place is amazing. If you have seen the last emperor you can imagine how they lived. The place is huge and well kept. I would truly recommend a visit.
"Recommended for people who wants to learn more about China’s imperial history.. some parts of the palace is on renovation when I visited on may 2017.. nevertheless, the place is breathtaking from certain views over there.. the weather was good in spring and go during winter to avoid the crowds.. remember to try their Beijing duck!"
"I last visited the forbidden city in 2012 and it remains a superb centrepiece attraction.

Today security is very high, daily visitors limited to 80,000 and you are well advised to book in advance. And to get up early so the intense security check ordeal is out of the way quickly (long queues!). With the booking website being chinese language only there is quite a bit of fun to be had getting in...apparently one can turn up on the day but with all the queues and the limited numbers that seems quite a gamble to take on.

Putting these minor obstructions aside, this rightly remains one of the premier venues in China with a minimum half day visit recommended and, if you can muster the energy, a full day to take it all in."
You have to visit the Forbidden City if you're traveling to Beijing! Thousands of years of history in one place!
"Alright... so the palace and site itself are truly amazing. So much history! Lots of space. For sure get there early (for the time your tickets start), and make sure to bring the ID that matches your pre bought tickets.

LONG line to get in to the site when we were there from the subway (but T-Square was closed with extra security due to the Communist Party of China conference going on). Took an hour to pass security.

The English audio guide had much less information in English than my colleagues mandarin guide. It was good and worth it.

Really enjoyed, but the pollution was bad. Get a mask, and don’t feel bad using it!"
The total location is huge and requires a considerable amount of walking. Many beautiful buildings and impressive construction units of the past. A guided tour is recommended as it helps to understand some of the historical background.
"This is really a must see when in Beijing. Even though it's always crowded, you can find a lot of history and interesting facts about this imperial area while visiting.
Come in the morning to make sure you get a ticket and avoid some people's traffic."
"Been here twice, the place is huge and every temple/palace has entrance fees. To avoid long queues seek the help of locals to get tickets on line. Every time we come here, the place is always crowded. Much to our surprise the place was jam packed on holidays like the mid autumn festival. Good thing security is a priority here. The management anticipates the big crowd by placing security personnel on every entrances and every exits. You get in on one gate and exit on the other gate. We didn’t hire interpreters, we just observed and watched what the crowds are doing. From what we observed, this was a place of reverence. A place where the Emperor and his concubines live. A place where the Emperor conducts meetings, made announcements, made laws, planned war strategies and lived in grandeur. Most of the temples look the same - colored brick roofs shaped like sailboats.
From the Forbidden City walk to the Tianamen Square. Farther down the square is the Beijing Railway Museum."
"I went to the Forbidden City this May after watching the wonderful video "" Repairing Clocks at The Palace Museum"". The Clock Museum and the Treasure Museum are must-visits. All kinds of handcrafted clocks and treasures from Qing Dynasty are there to surprise you with advanced handcrafting techniques. Not mention the redecorated display rooms in Residences of the Kings and their wifes, they are telling stories about their life hundreds of years ago. I spent my whole day wandering from room to room until the sunset. Some special tips: 1) book your ticket online from official website and skip the queue in the morning( the clock museum and treasure museum need separate tickets which are also available online; 2) bring enough water during summer time since you'll need them to walk around a palace with thousands of rooms; 3) don't miss the sunset! People started to leave the museum at 4pm and the museum start to evacuate at 4:45 to ensure the 5pm closure. You'll find it better to take photos during this period of time with far less crowds and magnificent sunset view of the Forbidden City."
A beautiful place with a lot of history. Paying the extra for the audio guide was well worth it. I also recommend getting a chinese friend or staff at your hotel to book tickets online for you to beat the queues. The website is only in chinese. Far far bigger than us every imagined and very interesting 3-4 hours of exploring!
"This “city” goes on forever. It is a plethora of history and I would recommend that anyone visiting the city has s guide because otherwise you will not be able to absorb the vastness of this place. It once housed 20,000 Eunuchs and hundreds of concubines but without the purpose behind this history the trip would be a bunch of buildings."
This palace is real lyrics huge!!! We have been there during the national celebration of china and it was full of people. By being there the only thing that you doing is to see the buildings there is no something special that you can see.
Like all little shops they sell items to remind you of where you have been. Usual tourist items inside. Also a small seated area where you can have a cold drink or ice cream. A lovely haven after being out in the hot sun!
Forbidden city is large and will take a good couple of hours to get round. On top of that time we stood in the queue for security/bag check for an hour as well. We got the guided tour which automatically tells you info about the city as you walk round. It uses GPS so changes when you move around the city. It is very similar as you walk round as most buildings look the same but the gardens near the back of the city are worth a visit.
Fantastic museum and a wonderful place to waste an afternoon. You get a real insight Chinese history and old Beijing. Absolutely beautiful.
"I visited with my 58 yrs old mum. It is one of many ppl bucket list so we wanna c it.
I hv read from many reviews that we should entrance @Tianmen gate and walk through the north until reaching another side by evening time and climb up to the hill to see palace view.

To go there, station Tianmen East exit A, bring ur passport and be aware of long q for security check before enter the gate.

We were there in a week of government congress or something so security checks in BJ was v strict. It took us 1.3 hrs to finish the q and got inside (the day b4 I heard ppl said up to 2 hrs) but somehow watching ppl in a line was interesting enough, I and my mom just chat and waited so didn't feel that long hahah

Recommended to arrive in the afternoon so u can get the view at the end of the trip at late evening, we finished too early so it's still day time wandering wat would be when it's dark."
This is an amazing building with so much history. It is worth getting a guided tour if you can. Very busy.
I first went to the Forbidden City in 1985. It was very quiet back then compared to now. It was closed to most of the public back in 85 but fully open now so always busy. Wonderful place to visit
"This is my 3rd visit to this amazing place.

We’ll start this review off by explaining that we went during an important Chinese Government Conference so there might’ve been added security.

The first two times I went to the Forbidden City I entered through the North Gate. However, this time when I showed up I was told to go back to the South Gate near Tiananmen Square. After spending 15 minutes to find a bus and get dropped off at the proper gate, we were greeted by a 45 minute line for ID and bag check just to get to the Gate of Heavenly Peace.

Once at the ticket office they wouldn’t accept WeChat pay or Credit Cards, so I was directed to find an ATM which was thankfully close at the tourist-center, but it
only services Chinese bank cards.

Once inside it was amazing as usual.
Bring comfortable shoes and allocate enough time to properly explore everything in the vast complex."
"Mind Boggling expanse of beautiful buildings, palaces and houses; statues of golden lions, birds, tortoises, with the back drop of Jing Shan park_ just amazing!"
"The size of the site and the wealth required to keep this vast enterprise going is staggering, no wonder China went communist. Don't miss the ceramics, jewellery exhibitions and the clocks are bizarre in the extreme. Be there for 11 or 2 to see some in action (at the back of the hall)"
"I was there with my family and friends in October 2017, We had a guide who told us the ancient stories about forbidden city. It is a huge area covered with places. Effort has been put for this construction is unbelievable.Place is always crowded. But arrangements have been made for a free flow. It is the next best place to visit in China after the Grate Wall."
The Forbidden City is one of the world's most recognized (and visited) tourist sites for damned good reason. The guided tour was spectacular with the guide provided a commentary on each of the main point as we viewed it. And the history is amazing.
The size and scale of the place is amazing. You can visit for hours - probably days and not see it all. It's much more interesting with the audio guided tour or a local guide like we used to provide the background and history. But you can just visit to see the scale and grandeur of the whole area. We took the time to climb the 300 steps to the Pavilions atop Jingshan Park for a better view of Palace Grounds. Don't miss if you are in Beijing.
"It's hard to describe the sheer scale of the Forbidden City. When you closely examine the detail of the buildings with the ornate paintings and tiles the number of manhours to complete the Forbidden City is staggering. Even the size of the tile and brickways is mind boggling. A very beautiful place to visit but wear good walking shoes. To enter all the gates and see the entire city you will walk miles. Our tour guide told us about 10,000 people lived within the walled city. We are very fortunate to have the 'Forbidden City' no longer 'Forbidden'. A must-see while in Beijing! A security check is required upon entrance."
I will come back to Forbidden City andThe Palace Museum that fact that you can not walk inside the palace it was to crowded to pick from the outsise
"Crowds kept us from enjoying the full affect of this striking display of architecture. Still, you really do have to see it if you’re in Beijing."
"it's a place you need to see but everything will start looking the same in a short time. many of the anice sitesyou cannot take photos of. The place is huge and inde tour guides will approach you as you enter the grounds offering you a pvt tour for 200cny. There really is not a need for one because like i said everything will start looking the same and your not going to remember what they tell you anyways but they can steer you away from things that are not worth the time or effort to go look at so could be worth it. people were elbow to elbow and you had waits for everything or people pushed in front of each other for better looks, either way it was jammed. Word of advice, NOTHING AND I MEAN NOTHING within 20 miles of the middle of beijing should be more than 50cyn. Every rickshaw, or non cab will try to take you for at least 150-300 for a 20-25cny trip. They scam every foreigner they see and will even drop you off at the wrong spot. Take a real cab or be on a real tour..PS gift shops in just about every building."
"Not enough flowers , trees ; only a few near the emperor house .Cannot go near the buildings ; have to see them from nearly 150 feet far away , since there was too many tourists , the administration have to fence all the attractions"
"The Forbidden City has a large number of beautiful palaces, including emperor office hall, palace and her wifes' palaces. A must-go place in Beijing."
"Tiananmen Square is HUGE, it can hold about a million people at one time. As a result of tourism it was unbelievably crowded. The Forbidden City itself is very crowded but it was not as bad as the square outside. The grounds itself are amazing both in size and detail. The attention to detail was unreal, a definite worthy visit. Lots of walking so make sure to pack the appropriate gear (shoes, water, etc.)"
"If you only have a few hours, or a few days the Forbidden City is a must on any Beijing visit. Palaces are all restricted access and can only be viewed from the doorways."
Well worth a visit leave yourselves a couple of hours to explore the site. Most of the buildings look alike but use your imagination.
"Every nightmare you have ever had of the world being overrun by humans, will manifest itself as you approach this site. In China, domestic tourists probably outnumber foreign visitors by 5000 - 1. Impossible numbers of unruly, ill-mannered, screeching & shoving crowds create a stampede-like atmosphere at the multi-layered security checkpoints. Large tour groups is one thing, but whole villages on the move is quite another - and this is what you will encounter at most historic & political attractions in China, especially those promoted amongst its rural population.
Standing in the queues we got sniffed at (I swear I could feel a tiny old woman behind me nuzzling my neck), our belongings touched & looked into, coughed & sneezed on & probably made fun of. And the security is atrocious - you'd think the country was at war!
Take heart - as soon as you can enter, don't stop for photo ops, do it on your way back when the crowds will have thinned out. Head straight for the galleries that cost extra to go into - the masses will not make it to these. Many of the galleries may be closed - the gold & silver, & jade halls were closed (unannounced) during our visit.
The buildings look great in 3D, but not really in photos where they appear pretty flat & one-dimensional. Seek out some interesting spots in the back gardens & quieter parts of the palace.
Bring your own lunch!
If also visiting the National Museum across the street, we recommend doing that first as it closes earlier, and you will be able to cross the road from an underground pass directly into the Forbidden City instead of having to walk around the whole block again & going through the Tiananmen Square security check all over."
"The big squares and building in the start were quite magnificent. The treasury was well worth the visit, and we enjoyed the dragon wall. Though we missed something unique to make it unforgettable. It is a stretch to walk through, as it get less interesting at the end, at least for kids."
We visited forbidden city with our friends in winter. It is a must visit place in Beijing. Please opt an Audio guide available at ticket counters. :)
"The only thing I would recommend to make this attraction better, is to watch some of the recently made ""western"" movies depicting the last Emperor, which were actually filmed here.

Watching some of these movies will give you a better sense of the History of this magnificent place."
"I must have been here more than a handful of times, but it never seize to impress, and I discover new things every visit. Remember to also visit the gallery of timepieces and gallery of jewelry/jade/artefacts collection, which you have to buy separate tickets RMB10. But it is definitely worth it. The Palace Museum Resturant offers quick local dishes and great coffee/beer, USD12 for a fast meal with beverage. Efficient, hygienic and tasty. It a a huge 'city', so remember to wear sensible walking shoes and bring a good camera along."
"A unique place to see many exclusive treasures while exploring the history and architecture of this ""royal palace"" of china."
my friend visited beijing so I went here with her. the exhibitions were about chinese ceramic and sculptures. they were decent but I am sure the painting exhibition would be more exciting
"60CNY to get in, totally worth it. Huge place and it wasn´t actually very crowded!! It takes couple of hours to go through the whole place. Buy some snack before entering the place because there´s no ""real food"" to buy."
"My husband and I went during ""Golden Week"" which is a week long Chinese National Holiday. Pretty much what I am saying is it was pyscho filled with people. We got to the Forbidden City at about 8am and only found the ticket office by 8:30am. We were worried about getting in because they only let 80,000 people in a day and you have to get there early because they only allow Chinese Citizens to buy tickets online. We were told many times that the tickets were sold out and that we couldnt get them, but we found the ticket office anyway to try. There were signs all over saying sold out, but a few foreigners at the window. When we gave our ID and Student IDs she happily handed us tickets. We are guessing they leave some aside for foreigners, but still get there early. Very worth a vist, full of history, and really opens your eyes to how big and apart from the real world the Ancient Dynastys were."
It was very crowded when we there making some of the exhibits hard to get close enough to see well alot of pushing and shoving. I was not overly impressed.
"The Forbidden City 31.8.17 Home of the Ming and Qing dynasties it was the sacred centre of the Chinese empire for 500 years. It is a vast complex with over 900 buildings on the 180-acre site and if you are visiting Beijing this is a must. You start at one end and then it is just one way through the complex until you exit at the other end. I cannot do it justice with any description, it is totally fantastic, unbelievable and incredible – just go!"
"This is an amasing place to visit, the shear size is something that cannot be believed, without seeing it. There is a huge number of visitors, so it is a full day"
"The Forbidden City is a great place to stroll through, not much shade on a HOT day, make sure you have sun screen and a hat, take plenty of water.."
"you lear a lot about china dynasty , a place to dream about our ancestors, and the live they did, great place"
"Full of history.
Great guide to explain all.
No plebs welcome.
Better than Tiananman square just metres away."
"Had to go thru security baggage check. Seem to take 1 hr to do. Lots of pushy people trying to gain an inch of space. Once past security, the palace is amazing. The rich history, the buildings are beautiful. 72 acres of land but not all of it is opened. We were told to buy tickets on line. But instead we hired a guide and she bought the tickets. So 60 for ticket and the 300 for tour guide. Lucky we had 5 people in our group so the 300 plus her ticket were split. Worked out to be 132 per person. Could spend half day there. Lots of photo taken."
A place you must see if in Beijing. We went with a private tour which made learning the history easier to learn. Wear comfortable walking shoes.
"You have to spend at least half day to see this plays because you have to walk minimum of 4-5 km within the city . This is a ancient building have largest museum.

tips
bring bottle of water and something to eat . Also wash rooms are not clean as we excepted ( this is a common issue in china )"
"The Forbidden City is an important place to visit and helps visitors understand Beijing as well as Chinese history.
DON'T FORGET YOUR PASSPORT as you need it to get in.
CLOSED MONDAYS
After reading other reviews I would say this - yes, there are many similar buildings in this complex and it may all appear meaningless unless you visit with a guide.
I've been to The Forbidden City twice before but it was more memorable with a guide. I also felt that visiting with my nine-year old would require more historical context so she could imagine what the Palace was like and also hear some of the quirks and funny stories a guide can use to may history come alive. We didn't pause much during the visit but even so I dont see how you can do the visit in under 2 hours. Wear comfortable shoes. There are always tourists in the Palace, but try to avoid weekends and Chinese Holidays and Chinese School Holidays. Like the Wall it is hard work in hot weather!! There are lots of ice-cream and drinks sellers inside. Nice momentos available at various shops as well. Guides also get a quicker entrance queue.
Happy to provide details of the guide we used, just contact me."
"This is a must see on every Beijing trip. I get there at 8:30 and run to the exhibitions I'm interested in. That way I beat the crowds. It's huge, take food, take drink. Always worth the visit."
Very large area with lots of walking. After a while all the buildings begin to look the same. Interesting culture and background on the emperors. Unique fire protection system. Large pots always full of water and kept warm in the winter time. You start at one end from Tiananmen Square and walk to the end of the city and exit. You cannot go back to the entrance. Toilets are few.
"The Forbidden City ..........what can i say! So pleased to have visited , the buildings are amazing. It was great to hear about the history attached to them. I have watched programs on the tv but nothing beats a personal visit. The day we went it was extreamly hot and those wiith mobility issues struggled to get around - a couple hired wheelchars for about 300 yuan pp. I loved this place and would like to have spent longer there."
"We had a very articulate young lady as a guide..she enjoyed the experience and so did we.
We we're not supposed to put our foot on the threshold, we had to jump over it for good luck.
What impressed me is the reverence Chinese have for their history. And the beautiful way in which things are preserved.
Honestly very little has survived the devastating cultural revolution. My estimation is that only 5-6 % of the historical n cultural sites exist today but the way it has been showcased...it's awesome. I salute this country.

In the museum, they have preserved beautiful fabrics. Yellow and purple were the royal colors.

Feng shui played an important role in royal households. There are animals on the roofs which tell you about the position.

Concubines were also housed in this palace..many small rooms are still preserved.

Why is it called Forbidden city, I didn't understand. I think it was Forbidden to commoners to enter this place.

It is situated near famous Tianamen Square."
We had a personal tour to forbidden city and tiannamen square. I highly recommend that. Tour guide makes all arrangements for the tickets and the personal driver dropped us off very close so there was less walking. Tour guide took care of everything and gave us a wonderful commentary about the history.
"It's a large complex, better to visit in the morning. It's very organised and clean, map is available. Only one entrance and North Gate is the exit.
Be aware of placing tickets in advance, no tickets sold on the spot.
Free wifi is available."
"Been there many years ago but wanted to revisit again to explore more of their newly opened area as well as the new displays. A unique place to see many exclusive treasures while exploring the history and architecture of this ""royal palace"" of China."
"If you are in Beijing, whether for business or vacation, you really do need to plan time to visit here! It’s on the same (or higher) level of impressiveness as Versailles or any of the British royal palaces. Visiting here will give you a sense of the long and proud history of China. Get there early and have a private guide arranged. Fortunately, we have a local friend who arranged for our tour guide ahead of time. Be prepared for crowds and don’t be shy about moving through the crowd to get pictures of the Imperial Throne, etc. If you’re timid, you won’t get pictures of those special rooms. Also, if you’re a so-called “westerner” be prepared for people to randomly take your picture or to politely ask to have their picture taken with you. It’s all part of a wonderful experience! So, what are you waiting for?! Go visit and soak up this incredible place!"
"Honestly one of the best places I've ever been. The buildings are stunning, and some of the art and artefacts which are kept on the Forbidden City are sensational.

I walked around for about five hours, on my own, without realising how long I'd been there. If the weather had been better, I probably would have stayed even longer, just to sit and take it in.

The written information is all in Chinese and English, which made it rather educational as well.

Entry is 60RMB. Pay it and go!"
"National Palace Museum (故宮博物院) is connected
from Tiananmen Gate (天安門).
Ticket can buy by only internet.
And it’s limited (80K people/day).
For foreigners, hotel can support to buy it.
(It depends on hotel)

When I visit there, it was national holiday of China.
So there are so so many people were front of Tiananmen Gate.
In order to enter, there is severe security check.
After the entering, visitors can see majestic view
and traditional buildings.
There are also some museum area for valuable items.
(Historical Jewelry goods, Clocks,,,,)

It was fantastic experience."
"Visiting the Forbidden City during the autumn national holiday was probably not our best plan - 80,000 online tickets sold out per day, but it had to be done. We decided to book a private guided tour a few days before and it was well worth it. The scale of the place is unimaginable, with no spoken Chinese we would have struggled to even work out how to enter. They are very good at managing huge crowds and it all moves along smoothly. There is one way through from front to back and it is HUGE. Our guide ( Discover China) was able to give us a potted history and interesting snippets - you could spend an entire day inside but not on a very crowded hot day.
The historical context is essential to fully appreciate it, otherwise you are viewing many very similar buildings on a huge scale.
Unmissable"
"Visited the F'city during this week's national holiday. The place was packed and tickets were sold out. We entered via the West Side (recommended). Once in the first courtyard we noticed all the ticket windows were closed. By chance we saw a couple guys get in line at a window marked Passport. We don't usually travel around town with ours but this day we had brought ours. Stuffed them in the window without saying much. The clerk barked out ""120rmb"" so we stuffed that under the window too. We were handed two tickets and in we went. The city has plenty of write ups, and lots to find on Utube if your fortunately enough to have a VPN. We did try to enter from the North end as that worked a few years ago, but not this time. Perhaps the crowds or policy changed as this wasn't an option. Visit the book/gift stores in the city if interested to own a coffee table book."
"This place was so vast, beautiful and full of history ....... I was in utter amazement the whole time. We went with a private tour guide that offered such an abundance of knowledge of this place .... we were just amazed. This place is vast! You could literally spend days here. Make this place worth your time and go with someone who is knowledgable and. An explain every detail.
It will dazzle and amaze you."
"It was 32 degrees and humid as heck and 60,000 Chinese passing through the Forbidden City every day. The day was very hazy which the official weather channel said was fog (???). We walked through gate after gate and throne room after throne room. It was huge, magnificent and colourful.I had to fight my way thru 60k Chinese to get a photo of the throne room :).
This was one of life's must do experiences for me and I was not disappointed just hot and tired after 3 hours in the sun. On the guided tour much of interest to me was missed so I think you need to spend a couple of days there to do it justice - if you have the stamina."
You have to see it to believe it. You read about this place in history books but it doesn’t prepare you for the real thing. It’s where the emperors & their families lived. You can visit several museums and learn about the Ming and Qing dynasties. This is a must see in Beijing if you appreciate architecture and history.
You need a whole day and a fabulous guide to ensure you make the most of this visit. I would recommend Dean from China Odyssey Tours to show you around this unique place. He was able to explain the different areas and skilfully guide us through.
Don't miss experience! I would recommend this experience to anyone going to Beijing for vacation or business.
First ask hotel to buy ticket as they sell out. Bring paspoort to enter and bring water and good walking shoes. Tickets online cost about 60 yuan per person. We could not believe our eyes. Nothing compares to this place. We spend 3 hours and still feel like we needed more time to see it all.
A busy spot that attracts a lot of visitors. However it is a large area with lots of areas to explore.
"The Forbidden City is a vast array of buildings – over 9000- which was the imperial city for many centuries and is a ‘must see’ attraction. The views is splendid and the buildings just add to the sense of grandeur. The museum itself is very small but worth a visit
Very busy tourist attraction with lots of people and crowding can become an issue along with the noise of the many tour guide microphones which can be frustrating, popular with tourists and locals alike"
"We came. During the October festival, the palace sold out if tickets by 930am (85k people) so aside from being incredible busy, this is a truely magnificent site. To. See!"
"This palace/temple complex is VAST!!! I'm talking kilometres. A really important tip is that foreigners have to show their passport to buy a ticket otherwise you will not get in. You can take your bags into the site, unlike visiting the Mao Mausoleum where you have to check your bag into a depot over the road to be eligible to view his body. The queues can be huge to do this. The Forbidden City was crowded but tickets can be quickly purchased by comparison. We used an audio guide which was OK but I have learned a lot more since. It will take your a couple of hours at least to see the site. Water and snacks can be purchased within."
"Quick walk through during a long layover in Beijing. We were lucky to get an absolutely clear day-- no rain or smog. Arrived about half hour before the ticket office opened. Lots of tour groups waiting at the gate for opening. But those crowds cleared quickly and the ticket lines seemed to move at a good pace. Can't speak to the audio guides but I think they were only ¥7.
The grounds are very well kept. We quickly wandered through each palace / area until the garden entrance only - we had a flight out at 2 and so we left the palace at 10. Gift shops, toilets, and coffee / snack stalls in the garden entrance.
Beautiful and amazing to think of all the history of ancient China. It felt like a privilege to visit such an important historical monument."
The history surrounding the Forbidden City is amazing. Well worth a visit to check out the beautiful buildings and the intricate statues and the museums are interesting. You could quite easily spend the day there just checking everything out. A must on the list when in Beijing.
We only had two hours to explore the Forbidden City. Entrance fee is reasonable and you’re able to rent an electronic guide. A full tour takes about a four hours. One could almost imagine the Emperor and his entourage. Definitely a bucket list item.
"The Forbidden City was one of the most interesting stops during my short stay in Beijing. I spent several hours walking around the palace and visiting some of the ancillary exhibits. I paid CNY60 for admission to the Forbidden City and another CNY10 for the Clock and Watch gallery.

If you have the fortune to visit the Forbidden City, you'll come away amazed by the number of large court yards, gates, and buildings located throughout the complex. There were several moments during which I thought we had hit the last gate, only to have a handful more to pass through. I came to the Forbidden City on a private tour and I personally think a tour guide is absolutely necessary to get the full experience of the rich history found here.

Getting into the Forbidden City is somewhat of a journey. First you must enter Tiananmen Square, which is heavily guarded by security. The lines are intimidatingly long, but tour groups have their own entrances (at least I did). From there, you walk towards the complex at the northern end of Tiananmen, where you can purchase admission to the Forbidden City.

Each court yard and gate has its own history, with certain rituals or practices carried out in certain areas of the Forbidden City. The architectural design and decoration is stunning. As you approach the northern gate (to exit the Forbidden City), you'll enter a complex of smaller living quarters that used to house the emperor's extended family, mistresses, and other high-level officials of the time. It's here that you will find some ancillary exhibits, including the Clock and Watch Gallery.

The Hall of Clocks and Watches is an enormous collection of clocks (mostly Western and manufactured in Switzerland, Britain, France, etc.). The clocks were collected during the Qing Dynasty (17th - 20th century). Yes, some of these clocks are ~200 years old. It's a treat to see the craftsmanship and the detail presented in the clockwork. I strongly recommend taking the time to visit this gallery while you're in the Forbidden City. Tickets can be bought at the entrance to the gallery and you should anticipate at least an hour if you intend to take your time enjoying the exhibit.

I rate the Forbidden City with five stars because it really is a must-see that blows away any pre-existing expectations that you might have."
"I have to confess - I was a little bit disappointed as my expectations were too high for this place.
On a day we visited there was heavy smog in the air and as the place is HUGE it was very tiring and I was out of my breath all the time (I always thought smog is just a myth ... until this day)
So many courtyards, temples and buildings to see in this complex & you will get a better understanding of Chinese history during the visit. Spare yourself at least 2 hours.
Tip #1 Have CNY with you they do not accept credit cards and no ATM closeby
Tip #2 Visit after the lunch as place will be less crowded
Tip #3 Take an audio guide"
"Fabulous history so much to see its all linked Tiananmen square so you a full half day .
In the Forbidden City there is so much to see if you haven't seen the movie the Last Emperor watch it before you go it brings the city to life"
Very popular attraction! Lots of crowds.. Lots of history in Beijing here. U would enjoy this area part of the diff Dynastys u'l b acknowledge by ur tour guide.
"The Forbidden City served as the home of emperors and their households as well as the ceremonial and political center of Chinese government for almost 500 years. It has, according to legend, 9,999 and 1/2 rooms. Everything is built with 9 as the sacred number. It is the number of the emperor. The ground cover some 180 acres. The thought and craftsmanship that went into the city is difficult to fathom. Nothing was done by accident. With the Great Wall this is the site not to be missed. Take a guide or you will never understand the intricacies that went into the building of the miraculous place."
"The Forbidden City is one of the largest attractions in China, make sure you have good walking shoes on, as it it massive. There is a huge amount to see so make sure you have heaps of time, do recommed that you do a guided tour as it is hard to get around with out a guide."
"The wonder, though, is in the beauty of the architecture, the sheer expanse designed to intimidate - and it does. It's pretty easy to imagine the effect of it all on some lowly official or visitor from the rural areas. As far as the art and craft displays, they're pretty sparse."
"This is a big palace with many court yards, rooms and workmanship. There is so many rooms that are still closed off to visitors for once or more reasons. However it is a great place to visit and to see. Do expect to be pushed and by other native Chinese visitors from other parts of China. If you are black expect to be asked to take pictures or they will do it sneaky without your permission."
"I revisited the Forbidden City in September. If anything I enjoyed it more. This time I explored the sides rather than go straight from throne room to throne room. The smaller spaces were more interesting and more accessible. Many of the public audience rooms were blocked and for some odd reason the openings with the best views into the space were blocked which was a disappointment. As a result big clogs of people jammed into the small viewing area to take pictures and most never actually saw the interior until they could look at the cameras they had held in the air. This was true of me as well. We rented the portable tour devices which were great until mine arbitrarily changed languages.
The Palace is clean and well maintained and the areas around it are well maintained. The apparent fixation with crowd control and circulation means that you always flow in one direction. In our case we entered the museum from Tiananmen Sq and then walked for several miles to find ourselves at Bahia Park wjhich is worth a stroll."
"if you visiting china, you must visit the forbidden city with a tourist guide to live the history of china"
Make sure to buy tickets on wechat before visiting the museum and bring your passport to avoid the line and hassles.
"A very good historical location to take a peek into the past of China. Too bad that some of the location were under renovation when i was there. Do note that these renovation will be a constant until 2030 as China is taking a great effort to restore these artifact to their formal glory with very skilled artisan that will need time to restore the artwork..

Try to spend at least 1 day here so that you can take time to listen to the audio guide properly and wlk through all the small ""streets"" in the palace."
"This is the third time I have visited but the last time was ten years ago. Price was 60 rmb for adult and 20 rmb for teenagers/child classified as students. You need your passport. We had heard that we had to be lined up at 8am for a chance to get a ticket however, we were visiting Tiananmen Square around 11am and saw people entering so thought we would try our luck. There were a lot of people given it was a few days before the October holiday but not nearly as busy as I would have thought and we moved through comfortably. There was virtually no line up. We weren't able to get a live guide who spoke English but we got one audio guide for 40rmb which was gps activated and worked perfectly well. You don't have to leave your passport as there are beepers on all the exits. Toilets and eateries were maintained well. It is an incredible place to visit absolutely worth the money to get a guide or audio guide as the explanation of the history and development make it a special experience. We didn't visit all of it as our 7 year old and 3 teenagers, while they loved it, did get over it after an hour or so."
Festival too. Lots of noodle places but most hang out at the brown door a small hole in the wall but all the cabs know where it is. There are some clubs that don't allow Americans but they will stop you before you get in. Nice app lace to visit but I was glad to get home
Again a must when in Beijing. Adjoins Tianamen Square so you can view this area before you enter the Forbidden City. It is magnificent and in beautiful condition. So much to see and understand about the Emperors that you must have a good English speaking guide. Our guide was brilliant he was our tour escort from Viking river cruises. Without him the tour would have been a failure and we would have not understood the significance of the various buildings and why each courtyard is located where it is.
"The place is massive, and each area seems to be more beautiful than the last. I don't know how anyone can see all of it, but that's ok. Pick a direction and explore. Get an English audio guide, as there are no signs."
"We went there early in the morning after reading that it can get very crowded.

It was a good choice. The queues were short and we entered quickly. Even in the morning there is loads of people on group tours.

We tried to book tickets online but the website doesn't exist in English...

As for the site itself, it is not spectacular, but it's definitely a must see. For me it was a little too monotonous as everything looks the same really."
"Be prepared for the crowds, our tour guide took us around the perimeter to avoid the crowds a little but it can feel very chaotic. Worth it though, hearing the amazing history of this unique and special place. Really enjoyed the gardens towards the back of the palace, lots of fascinating things to see and learn. Would highly recommend!"
"A series of enormous courtyards and large palaces make this an impressive place to visit. The extent of the fortifications make it clear that being an Emperor was a bit of a lonely job that resulted in indulgences and paranoia.

It was nice to see some of the interior of buildings here."
"While I cannot verify the existence of 9,999 rooms at the Forbidden Palace, I can verify that the grounds are immense. Just when you think you've entered ""the palace,"" you're in another receiving or ceremonial area...

We were with a private guide who was very knowledgeable, which was helpful -- and, from what I hear, is a better option than the audio guide. While we did not get to skip the queues, he was able to show us the palace highlights and important spaces, and skip the places which ""all look the same.""

As other reviews note, the Forbidden Palace is crowded; it is a tourist attraction for locals and for those from afar. Luckily, the grounds allow for some space to wander, but front-and-center viewing will require either patience or pushiness. But, when in Beijing it should not be missed."
"Like almost all the other tourist destination in China get to the forbidden city as early as possible. If you go late it is no problem but it will be just little crowded. You need to carry you identification to get a ticket else you won´t get in. I took a audio guided tour. They tell you not to touch any button on the machine and it starts right away. Try to listen carefully and understand the way it works before you start. If you take a look at everything it will take approx. 4 hrs as per the audio guide or you can opt other options as well depending on the time you have. Take a water bottle it is expensive in side. And if it is a hot day you might need couple. It is majestic to see the exteriors of all the buildings but to see what is in these buildings will be challenging as there will be a small opening or a door and there will be a lot of people standing outside it all the time. so you can´t get a very good view until unless you wait little longer for your turn. So I got bored of walking outside and not get to see what is in these beautiful buildings.
When you get out of the Forbidden City you are in totally opposite side and it is quite a walk to go back. So if you plan to come back to the square it will be quite a walk."
"The Forbidden City has some amazing history, and its scale is inconceivable for one person and those around him. The complex helps you understand the Emperor 's life. The complex also hides some amazing stories of Zhu Di and Cixi- and all the associated politics.
The complex is MASSIVELY crowded though, and that does detract from the experience.
If you expect spectacular structures, this will disappoint you. The interesting aspect here is the hidden stories, the historical culture and the pure scale."
"I really didn't enjoy my time at the Forbidden City, I tried to do research before, I stood in line to buy the audio guide, and still I felt like there was not that much valuable information given. 'Here's where the emperor made decisions', 'here's where the emperor ate lunch' I was hoping for more interesting insider knowledge to give the place more dimension, but that didn't happen that often. Yes the place is very nice, but difficult to take nice photos because of the crowds, also difficult to see inside most of the buildings because you have to battle like 500 other pushy tourists. In summary, go because it's what you do in Beijing, but try to stay for only a few hours. Maybe a tour guide would have been better, I don't know!"
Incredible. The architecture. The gardens. The aesthetic. Everything. It's magnificent. You are transported back in time to when this city would have been thriving. It gave me added appreciation for Chinese culture and history. Strongly recommended.
Excellent place to visit and easily spend a day. Some reading prior to the visit can be very helpful.
I have heard about the Forbidden City since I was small and heard my parents talk about it a lot. It is unbelievable about how huge it is and the history of it. It was unfortunate that my friends and I didn't have enough time to go though the whole forbidden city. This is a must visit place if you enjoy studying history and architecture.
"The gardens here as so beautiful, we went as part of a tour and weren't disappointed. So much history doesn't disappoint."
"So crowded we were unable to even look in through the doors.
Absolute chaos, locals have no concept of queueing"
"We arrived at the Tiananmen Gate, where the Mao picture hangs off of Tiananmen Square. It was one of those places everyone should visit in their lifetimes because of all of the history -- good and bad. The Forbidden City itself is extensive. The buildings all run together after awhile because the grounds are so big, and they all are built in the same style. But, it was on my bucket list, and I was glad I checked it off."
Great walking tour of the FC. Place is huge. Beautiful architecture. Well worth the price of admission.
"You need a guide to get to and through the masses. I can whole heartedly recommend William (his English name) with China Highlights. He is enthusiastic, knowledgeable and shares a sense of fun."
"Eat your Wheaties and be prepared!!! The Forbidden City is massive! They don't call it a ""City for nothing! LOL!

The sheer size and magnitude of this place requires time, and a great pair of walking shoes. I seriously regret not spending more time there. We were on a tour, and had not a lot of time.

There are plenty of places to stop and soak it all in. There are so many photo opportunities as well...so don't ever feel that you have missed one, there will be another.

Again, cash is KING in China. If you want a souvenir or refreshment while there, bring your cash. Your Credit Cards will get you nothing around these parts!

Overall, it's impressive and astounding. Definitely worth the trip!"
"This is a must visit for Beijing!!! Must!!!
Absolutely blown away by the history behind it.

Remember to wear comfy footwear, and bring water and a hat. Lots of walking. Rent an earphone piece at the entrance. Its sensored and will explain to you the history and stories behind each spot within the forbidden city as you reach it. Cheaper than a tour guide, and you can explore the place at your own place.

Go in the morning as less crowded. On busy days remember to book first online."
"You have to pass through quite a few walls, lovely buildings and archways to get here, a real taste of history and the Forbidden city is well worth the walk making the visit a memorable experience. A must visit when you visit Beijing."
"It takes around 3 h to visit this whole site, or even more, depending on how crowded it might be. Try to go as early as possible."
"Allow a couple of hours ( and wear comfy footwear ) to fully explore this city enclosed behind the solid stone walls. The front section of the city houses the formal occasoion structures, the emporor only living there during these special events. As you proceed through many public squares and pass lovely gardens you get a comprehension of how big this city really is.The rear section was the everyday living quarters of the emporor and emporess. The emporor could have up to 3000 concubines in attendance. These people had their own quarters and private garden spaces. This Forbidden City is steeped in history. The buildings and stairs have stood the test of time, beautifully constructed and decorated. An attraction not to be missed when in Beijing."
"Beautiful historic palace at the heart of Beijing and this is a must see. Visitors should show a valid ID which is a passport for foreigners (or if you don't have it you can show the driver's license, I showed my UK license). It'll take quite a bit of time to cover the whole place so leave at least 2-3 hours. Also recommend coming through the south side as you have to take the long way around if you're heading to Tiananmen."
"Please avoid weekends to visit the Forbidden City, as it get s so crowded that you just end up walking with the flow and miss out many details."
"This is a sight that you feel you must see but how much you enjoy this place will depend on your level of interest, your expectations and how you decide to visit.
Travelling as a family (with older children) always involves compromise and our visit had to fit around everyone’s hugely different levels of interests. My review is written with that in mind.

Practicalities first. Arrive early, preferably just before opening time and especially if you haven’t pre-booked your tickets. We didn’t have to queue and it wasn’t really busy when we first went in. We travelled in July, a busy season. Take your passport, you won’t get in without it. We didn’t use a guide and didn’t hire an audio-guide and missed neither. We did have a guidebook and found Travel China guide and China Highlights to be good sources of online information.

Be realistic about what to expect. It is a city so it’s BIG. It will involve a lot of walking, the courtyards are huge and many of the buildings can’t be visited; only viewed through a doorway or window. When we did battle the crowds to take a peek through a doorway we didn’t find it that interesting and felt that we were looking at the same thing but in a different building. It’s a good idea to look at a map of the Forbidden City before you visit so you can decide what you want to see (and see what’s off-limits). As you enter one end and exit the other you won’t want to double back for something you’ve missed. There are restaurants on site so you can have a break when you need one.

You have to pay extra to enter some buildings/galleries. We visited the Clock Gallery which is classed as a must-see. Well yes, if you’re into clocks. Although they were impressive, we could have skipped this.
I definitely thought it was worth paying extra to see the Palace of Tranquil Longevity (the Treasure Gallery and Nine Dragon screen are here too). This was in a quiet, picturesque, northeast section of the city and it felt like a mini city within a city. There was quite a bit to see here and it wasn’t crowded.
There were some pretty gardens near the exit but the crowds were so busy by then that we just wanted to leave.

We spent about 3 hours in the city and that was enough for us. By just concentrating on the things that interested us, not bothering with the others and taking a break, we enjoyed our visit and still felt we got a good impression of the place.
To get a sense of scale of the city and a really good view of it from above, climb the hill in Jingshan park which is a short walk away from the city exit."
Tons of history here but a serious time commitment... thousands of tourists 99% Chinese but absolutely worth checking out... photogs don't expect shots without people in them
"This place must be visited if you are in Beijing. The whole site is huge and is absolutely eye opening. There are 999 rooms and you need to spend at least half a day to appreciate the the history of the ""city"". There is no coffee or tea house for proper refreshment in the compound. It is wise to bring your own water and some snacks if you are spending time in the city."
"Lots of walking and massive structures . However be wary of lots of crowd ... hustling around.

Ticket windows are inside the gates - remember to carry passports . Also pick an audio guide for RMB 40 if you are not having a guide"
"You cannot avoid the hordes of tourists everywhere, this was a big disappointment and at the end decided just to get out and not come back; a real tourist trap. You can see about the same amount of things from the outside the forbidden city and save yourself ten bucks."
"It's pretty big,and always crowded...I guess this is why you enter on one gate,and exit a different one..
The tickets are 60Yen and it will take you about 2 hours if you want to fully enjoy and discover each section.

I would suggest you go in the morning,I think it may be less crowded.We went there at 13.00 and there were a lot of people."
"Walking through each area I was surprised it looked all the same. the overall area seemed to be over a mile. The steps leading up to the buildings were something to see as well. I sat to one side to take it all in. You can see the golden throne from the doorway. It was difficult for me to get through all the visitors to see it. After I got there I had trouble getting out. Everyone shoving, all of a sudden there was a slight opening and a hand reached for me and pulled me out. It was one of the tourists traveling with me. He is much taller than me and saw I was in trouble. Wow what a blessing."
"Yes, there will be lots of Tourists - many Chinese travel from all over China to visit this site. The buildings are spectacular and you get a real sense of history. Highly recommend using a guide to show you around. We used Robert Ren with Catherine Lu Tours and highly recommend him! The Forbidden City is quite large, but easily walkable. The architecture and history make it a Must See place on your visit to Beijing!"
"Like the wall, it's astonishing how long the Forbidden city goes on for as is the awe it inspires. And also like the wall the pollution is quite visible. Nevertheless, seeing Beijing without seeing the Forbidden city would be a tragic waste."
"Only when you get to the location does it dawn on you why they call it a ""city"" even though it was technically the emperor's home. The place is massive! It took 2.5 hours (including exploring time) to make it from one end of the city to the other.

China is full of history and culture, and the Forbidden City is a part of it. Built during the Ming dynasty, it is amazing to see Chinese palatial architecture right in front of you. The Forbidden City was declared a World Heritage site in 1987.

The Forbidden City is one of the largest and best preserved collection of ancient buildings in China.

Definitely not a handicap friendly place, and exploring the city requires climbing multiple levels of stairs at various parts around the city. Doorways come with a high threshold which you would need to step over to enter or exit the doorway.

The bathrooms conditions, if you haven't been to China before, can be shocking to some, and don't expect a high level of cleanliness that you might otherwise be used to."
"This is a must-see attraction. That being said, it is impressive more to it's size rather than what it specifically offers. Go because it is the most historically significant site in Beijing. It is an unbelievable complex. Upon entry, the entry plaza, is spectacular. The subsequent plazas are too, but in between, the buildings are very much the same on the outside, with one small doorway open to peer into. There were so many people pushing to see inside, catching a glimpse was nearly impossible. As you walk through, the complex the crowds thin and spread out. There are long side streets,with seating. there are ample restrooms, snack spots, gift shops and a few restaurants. As long as your expectations are to see the complex rather than artifacts and royal rooms ( as in other palaces etc, where visitors tour one room after next) you'll be satisfied. To that point, don't miss seeing the small but beautiful museum adjacent to the dragon screen. It's an additional fee, but worth it. after seeing the dragon screen in the courtyard, proceed around the buildings interior, where artifacts are displayed in a museum. Another highlight is the clock display. Otherwise, the whole rest of the forbidden city is an outdoor attraction. We liked it, but were underwhelmed with what was offered."
"The whole place is just repeating all the time, except the garden at the end. I tried to return the same way I entered and guards told me that I can't return. So I had to walk 45 minutes just to come back to the entrance... Seriously, deeply dissapointed. Spend your time at some other place."
"Historic and big, a must see. However it would be nice to go inside more buildings instead of looking through glass into dark rooms."
"Except for its bigness, once you have the description of one building all the rest is almost the same. The attraction, though, is a must for first-time tourist in Beijing as it describes the grandior of the place during the ancient times."
The history is very impressive and too see how the very few lived in total luxury is no wonder it came to an end
"Be prepared to walk and climb. There is a lot to see and view. Signage is extremely poor, even if you speak Chinese. Get one of the recorded tours to be able to figure things out. While it is not super-expensive to get in, there are additional charges to get into additional areas, such as the clock and watches exhibit."
We walked to Forbidden City from Tianamen Square about 5 to 10 minutes walk. For less crowed time avoid July and August. I love the Forbidden City it brought to life what I had read and watched shows of China during emperors eras. I also learned from my tour guide a lot more history of the different parts and buildings in the Forbidden City than I have read. A lot of walking but easy walks in comfortable flat shoes. So interesting. Recommended to visit.
"One of the must visit place in Beijing too.
I joined the tour & was very enjoyed listening to the stories of the palace/king/war.
The place was so crowded & full of tourists so beware of pick pocket."
"The Forbidden City is a must-do when in Beijing, much like the Wall. You enter through the Meridian Gate at the south end, and the traffic is one way until you finally emerge at the northern gate. You can expect there to be thousands of Chinese tourists, who have no idea about queuing or waiting to see something. The complex is vast and after an hour or two all the palaces, gates and pavilions begin to look the same. There are good maps in Chinese and English which show the lay-out of chunks of the City. Very few of the palaces are furnished - some are used as museums, e.g. the Hall of Clocks and Watches. There are some quiet gardens that you stumble across accidentally, until you reach the main garden near the north gate. Allow 4-5 hours and be prepared to push and shove at times. Visually stunning in places but all quite similar."
"Certainly, the palace itself is worth seeing, but what a horrible experience it is trying to get in to see it. Beijing lives up to it's poor reputation outside the communistic walls of China, with massively overcrowded streets, queues everywhere, police and security guards checking ID cards and passports at every turn, and an unbelievable lack of hygiene in its general population. On the day my wife and I visited the palace, we queued for nearly two hours under the humid, smoggy, morning sun and the body odour stench of thousands of other tourists and locals pushing and shoving their way through the main entrance. Our passports were checked when we entered the queue at 8:00am, twice whilst we were in the queue itself, and again in a second queue inside the grounds at the ticket office.
My wife and I had the Forbidden City on our bucket list for many years, and although it was interesting to finally see it in person, we're both so glad to put it behind us and try to put the hassles of pedestrian movement and traffic congestion within Chinese cities out of our memories, and try to remember only the positives.
In summary, the palace itself is generally viewed in about 15 to 20 minutes. If you are really convinced that you want to see it, allow a half day in order to get through the massive crowds. Also, be sure to carry your passports with you, and be sure to carry them in a secure place on your person, because pick-pocketing is rife and the police are useless at best."
"The reason I liked the forbidden city is probably because seeing all the pictures you've seen of a place before, materializing in front of you is always an interesting expericene. We went with a tour early in the morning so it wasn't as crowded as we thought it would be. We got in fairly quick with the group ticket. People were really nice to us - although the hundreds of pictures we took with the locals (yes WITH them not of them) was getting a bit annoying after a few hours lol. Anyways if you like history and intersted in feeling like Brad Pitt for half a day, make sure you don't miss the Forbidden City."
"The Forbidden City is an amazing place, don't get me wrong. It's huge and there's a ton of history that happened within it's walls. But... after you've gone through the process of entering and you've seen a few buildings and temples, they all seem to be the same.

If you're tackling the Forbidden City on your own, there's a free audio tour app on the App Store that I'd suggest you download before going. If you want to get the most out of your visit, get a guide to take you because there's so much to see and do and they'll give you the most insight.

The act of entering the place is an ordeal. We got up early and tried to go one day, but couldn't get in. We ended up going a few days later... better informed and better prepared.

To buy or pick up tickets you MUST (as a foreigner) bring your passport. To buy tickets online you have to have a code text-messaged to a Chinese mobile phone AND... the online system will not accept western credit cards. I ended up having to get an employee at our hostel to let me have the code sent to her mobile phone. She also paid for our tickets with Alipay and I gave her cash in lieu.

On the second attempt, we had tickets reserved and just had to pick them up. We also knew to bring our passports and we actually got into the complex.

We drifted along in the sea of humanity with tens of thousands of pushy Chinese tourists for about 10 minutes until we finally broke off on our own to explore the quieter side streets of the Forbidden City.

Once away from the crowds I enjoyed my time in the Forbidden City a lot. It was fun to walk the same streets that so many powerful Chinese emperors had before me.

I'd classify a visit to the Forbidden City as a must-do because, if you're in Beijing, you HAVE to go see it. That being said, I don't think I'll go back the next time I visit the capital."
"We had already seen the Temple of Heaven and to be honest, this just seemed like the same thing but much, much more of exactly the same thing. I wouldn't suggest it for kids. It was long and very monotonous. If you must go, don't commit yourself to a tour guide. We went on a guided tour and the pain of 6-7 hours of what in my mind would have been a very long half hour was just too much. Pedestrian traffic tends to be one way, so once in, I don't think it's so easy to get out. This place is ridiculously massive and equally boring. The tourist areas are void of historical atmosphere and very little of the original buildings were still in existence.
Go if you must, but you won't be regretting much if you miss it."
The Forbidden city is located at the center of the bustling city of Beijing. The forbidden city is really huge and there is a beautiful man made lake outside fronting the palace. We went there on a Sunday and there were a lot of people tourists and locals a like. I think its best to go there on weekdays to avoid the long lines for the entrance ticket. Its really a must to see this place while in Beijing.
"We unfortunately happened to go here on a Sunday which is not recommended if you are interested to see inside some of the buildings and enjoy a leisurely walk through the palace. The crowds were horrendous, pushing and shoving, elbows and really bad manners! And this was just the locals!
Overall the palace is huge and takes a good 1-2 hours to see properly. The buildings are beautiful as is the garden at the rear but none of the buildings are open to walk inside, you must view them from window openings on the outside which we didn't get to see due to the enormous crowd of pushy people.
If you go with a tour group you won't need to take your passport with you, otherwise you will need it to gain entrance.
Plenty of food vans to buys snacks and drinks and public toilets are frequent and clean."
This is another place so steeped in history and details that you really do need a guide to understand it all but another must do in Beijing!
"We were the lucky tourists in Beijing today when we had the privilege of touring Tiananmen Square and The Forbidden City with Smile from China Highlights. She is an exceptionally delightful young lady and made our tour amazing! She is extremely knowledgeable and articulate...and showed us wonderful hospitality. Also, she went above and beyond at the airport when we had a little confusion checking our luggage. We can't compliment her enough. Thank you, Smile! Thank you China Highlights and Lilian Huang!"
"Excellent example of Chinese history and architecture. The size amazed me with 9999 rooms in various temples. The engineering design, withstanding several earthquakes was very interesting.
Also good to see Chinese upgrading several buildings.
Very busy though, and it was the quiet season!"
A place in Beijing not to be missed. Highly recommend going in the morning as the afternoon we found quite busy.
"There is a route just right round the Forbidden City, take a look on the map and you will find it easily. Normally people starts from the NW or NE side and get into Beichang Street or North Chizi Street; then turn into Jingshan Front Street, run around the city, and get across a bridge at around the SW or SE corner into the palace, and run cross the South Gate to the other side.
The full route ended up a tiny bit more than 5 km, and is available for anyone 7x24. At the early morning or night when the visitors are gone, the route becomes even more awesome because you can enjoy the great view, with the red wall, the old outer palace view, and the moat, while enjoying the workout when you stay in Beijing."
"- Great place
- Educational
- Didn't see many staff around
- Beautiful and scenic views
- Once in a life time opportunity"
"Long after visiting the best preserved palace in China, I chance upon this documentary of the ingenious architecture back in the ancient days.
You can find that on youtube.

Oh yes, it is a huge with countless halls & palaces. It could take up a full day exploring if you're interested in China history.

Would love to revisit!"
"The place is a huge massive complex of many giant buildings. As the name says its a city. So do not expect it to be just like one small area with some exhibitions. The place is massive and foreboding. It will either leave you in awe or oppressed, as the design of the place was forbidden for normal people to enter which now have thousands of tourists trampling all over.

Go early to avoid the crowds as there is an 80,000 per day limit for tourists, and the local tourists are in the thousands flocking the area. Just be patient as you enter through the Meridian Gates regarding the hustle and bustle of people as once you enter, the whole complex is massive and depending on you, you can either just walk straight through from entrance to exit or linger around and explore the various alleys where usually there are no people around as they just walk straight on a ""highway"".

Wear comfortable shoes as you can spend hours just walking around the area. Words cannot describe the place, you just have to go and experience the Forbidden City itself if you are able to."
"This place is badly maintained, you'll see kids peeing everywhere. It's in a really sad state considering the grand past of this place. It's just like seeing the dramas and histories coming alive right in front of you. The crowd is really overwhelming though. If you were to fall, there might just be a stampede.

Entrance starts in the south and ends in the north. It's quite chaotic as people are recommended to take train instead of cabs due to the tight security within the area especially tiananmen. We had to walk a really huge detour to get back to the station after finishing at the north of the forbidden city. Most people would actually just take a bus over.

Do bring lots of water if you are visiting during the summer or early autumn as it does get rather hot in the afternoon.

If you are not familiar with history getting a licensed guide would be a good option, alternatively an audio guide would be just as useful. It's an attraction that despite the issues, is a place to visit once in your lifetime. Try to be there earlier to beat the crowds as it gets worst on weekends and late mornings."
"Loved the Forbidden City (no longer forbidden) but there were so many people and this was, from what I was told, the off season. It was far better preserved than my readings had led me to believe and there was an excellent, decently priced restaurant right in the middle."
"Wonderful place to explore but it's huge
As per previous posts I am ambulant disabled
If you're on an organised tour your guide can organise a chariot (wheelchair) and a guy to push it
A half day costs 350 Rmb @ £45 but it's essential as the journey is quite exhausting particularly in the heat and it's unfair on your partner
Ditto for the terracotta warriors but Great Wall and elsewhere is doable on foot depending on your capability"
"Frankly to me attempting a review of this heritage will result to a disservice, the best I can honestly state here is ""pls plan a visit and use a good guide like ours"" no matter the cost you will not regret it. The magnificent preservation and underlying history is what the day spent visiting it, and for a fact you cannot have enough of the heritage in one day, I feel like going back to those sections we didn't cover. Just see for yourself"
"When visiting Bejing, especially for the first time, there are couple of places you must visit. It does not matter they are crowded, sort of overrated, and let's say cliché. And Forbidden City is definitely one of them. I'm not trying to say by that it is not worth seeing. It is large, monumental and allows you to feel and experience some of the Chinese history and forces you to sink in it even for entire day.

Two things you ought to have in mind:
1. either buy your ticket online, or be there early - there are approx. 70k tickets a day and they disappeare in no time (1k every 10 minutes);
2. it is actually better to visit it in the afternoon as the greatest hordes of tourists are floating the palace complex in the morning (at 4 p.m. it is nearly empty)."
You literally walk around in the blistering heat for 3 hours looking at building that you can't go inside... and all the buildings look the same. You will get a much more comfortable experience looking at a picture on Google in a well air-conditioned room. It was also like entering a Nazi concentration camp. I stepped out of line to speak to my boyfriend and a worker with a baton started going crazy at me. No thanks!
"This place is obviously very impressive...lots of history... if you don't have txt through the guide it's better to buy txt online as in the busy months they may restrict the # of people visiting. Usually bw 60-80k people visit a day... but the place is so massive doesn't feel crowded at all... MUST wear comfortable shoes. Uneven pavers and lots of walking...also wear a sun screen and a hat even in the fall can easily burn.
Also if you have any fancy lighters better leave it at home ...they were taking away all the lighters at the security line."
"Another footage of great Chinese architecture,worth to visit,morning is the best time to visit to avoid crowded before the group of local visitor arrive,bit pricey ticket but it's really worth to visit,event all over area are covered with CCTV and guardian ,people still spitting everywhere and like to cut the line,overall really worth to visit"
"The forbidden city showcases you the dynastic era of China, maintained and face lifted during Olympic time by the present government. It contains massive structures and fortes. Ideal place of visit for historic lovers"
Grand palace. Place is crowded with people. Movement is limited. Magnificent structure and layout. Good to visit during off peak period.
"As with many of the historic Chinese sites in Beijing, this place is usually very crowded. However, there is so much to see here. If you are an English speaker I would suggest renting the guided tour recorder to get the whole story of each exhibit."
"The forbidden city is gigantic and amazing.
The public can only visit a small part of it and at that it is huge.
There is lots to see but big crowds so be prepared to wait a while to catch a glimpse of what is inside as you can only view the inside of the buildings via the windows / doors with barriers.
The toilets are adequate mainly Chinese style but the occasional western one.
There is a garden at the North end of the palace which is amazing, beautiful and serene.
Unfortunately we were rushed through by our guide but spend some time there if you can. There is a coffee shop there."
Basically It's a huuuuge place with lots and lots and LOOOTSS of gates. So it's kinda like a maze. Be prepared cause it might be confusing. Also be prepared for long walks. The toilets are awful and smelly. Its history and all is exciting if you get a tour guide or headphone but actually there's nothing much to see there. So don't expect something really amazing cause you'll get disappointed. Don't go on a sunny day in summer due to the large open area where you can get burns on your skin.
"Definitely a place to remember. The way the palace is maintained is amazing. The heritage is preserved well. This is definitely a must-do on the list, but be prepared for a lot of walking. And if you are traveling with kids, make sure you carry enough food and strollers for them."
"We went during the summer holiday break in China and it was absolutely overflowing with people. Sure, it was historic, but there wasn't much for the kids to see. The park is huge huge huge so make sure to leave enough time and also it's a good idea to bring a hat as there is literally no shade inside."
"A must to visit when in Beijing. Allow 4 hours at least as there is a lot to see.
People watching is excellent here as there are so many Chinese families out dressed in their lovely clothes, far better dressed than we Australians manage at home.
Wear comfortable shoes as it's a large place"
"My wife and I decided to bring our primary school-going children to visit The Forbidden City for a history lesson and also to improve their command of Mandarin conversation skills. The kids were looking forward to check out the Palace's nailless structures after watching a YouTube video on how the buildings could withstand violent earthquake attacks without falling.

The Museum management has implemented ticketing system using mobile payment, mainly via WeChat Wallet and Alipay. We, as foreign visitors, were very eager to test it out. However, we did not have a local China mobile number. Hence, we could not set up a WeChat Wallet or Alipay account. Enquiry at one of the many information booths in front of the museum entrance revealed that it was faster for us to just buy from the manned ticketing counters. We were there on a weekday off peak season, so there was not much of a queue. Children below 1.2 meter in height go in free. Children above 1.2 meter pay students' price with proof of student cards.

We wanted a Mandarin speaking tour guide for our children's learning purposes. We did not see any tour guide walking around until after we entered the main entrance. There was a tour guide service counter next to the audio guide rental counter. We were approached by an elderly offering tour guide service. We asked to see her official tour guide identity card and after some discussions, she pointed out a service price list erected next to the service counter. RMB 350 for about two and half hour of guide service. We went along with her. But I would not recommend you her service. Not worth the price. The audio guide would probably sufficient to do the job. It would have also helped a lot if we have done our reading up on the palace's history. Th guide lost interest after a while when we could not relate to most of her story telling, even though we could speak Mandarin with her.

It would take a full day to finish visiting the whole museum. There are museums within the museum which require separate entrance tickets. We visited the clock museum. Fairly interesting. Don't miss the Imperial Garden before the North exit.

We did not join any tour group. We took the subway and enter through the South Gate which is the only gate allowed for entrance. Expect to queue for security checks before entering. All gates: North, South, East and West Gates can be used for exit. We exited through the North Gate, which was a mistake as there was no subway station nearby. There were public buses connecting to Yi He Yuan (Summer Palace) and Yuan Ming Yuan (Old Summer Palace). There were lots of taxis but the drivers refused to go by meter. They would take the opportunity to demand a high price for a short distance. We walked quite a distance and asked quite a number of taxis under the hot sun. We finally relented to pay RMB50 for a trip within the city for which, if booked via DIDI app, would have cost only about RMB20.

I would recommend entering through the South Gate, visiting sites in the Palace compound in clockwise pattern, and exit via the South Gate again. There are restaurants in the Palace Museum compound. However, expect touristy price."
"Though essential to see and experience when in Beijing do be prepared for significant crowds. The palace itself is spectacular but gets rather ""samey"" after a while."
The Forbidden City was a lot larger than I had anticipated. It was absolutely gorgeous. Be prepared with a number of cold drinks in summer as the place can get very hot.
"To visit the Forbidden City you will need more than 1/2 a day. They rent you a audio device for 50 CYN. You need to follow it or it will not work. It is best to go during the week when there are not as many people. Unfortunately the day that we went it was poring rain, which put a damper on the visit. You will need your passport with you to purchase the entrance tickets."
"A great place to visit with plenty of history, very clean and well set out. We enjoyed our day there."
The Forbidden City and Palace Museum were just breath taking in all of its grandeur. The size of the buildings and grounds were simply amazing...
"We visited here in August and after walking through Tian,anmen square, entered via the Gate of Heavenly peace. Skipped queues as we went with a guide. Highly recommend this as there was nothing in english to read so its worth it. It was very humid and hot so be prepared with sunscreen, hat and water. The crowds are enormous and the only saving grace was we were all taller than the chinese so could at least see a bit ahead. Wear good walking shoes as your feet are going to kill you as this complex is massive,it covers 180 acres and over uneven cobble stones which you must be careful as not to either slip on or get tripped up. The site is cherised by the Chinese people not only for being the most well preserved heritage sites, the largest ancient palaces in the world . It is a listed UNESCO World Heritage site and has been home to 500 years of dynastic rule. There is so much to see in this site if the crowds dont get you down. Many buildings you could only peer into. The site is uphill, down dale which can be exhausting. Unfortunately this site is not for the frail, handicapped or those in wheelchairs. Allow many hours for this site, we didnt see a quarter of it over the couple of hours we stayed. Definitely a must see while in Beijing. (If you find this review helpful please tick the box tks )"
Beautiful buildings and this is a huge site with moats and inner courtyards but few buildings have anything in them -essentially empty. Would not spend the money to go up on the gate -nothing there but a few old photos and you can get the view from other buildings included in Palace Museum ticket. Lots of walking so runners are best. Try to get there early before all the tour groups.
"The Forbidden City is a great attraction you cannot miss! Nothing to say about this! But pay attention to Chinese ladies in the outskirts of the palace, ladies speaking excellent English, which is strange for ordinary Chinese people...they will try to seem interested in making friends, and they will ask you to have tea together... in collaboration with dishonest cafe'owners, the bill will be extremely high, even for one of the best European cafes!!!"
"This is one of the most important places to visit in Beijing. Its quite big so bring confy shoes, bring passport with you and get a guided tour from there."
The visit to Tiananmen Square and the Forbidden City was incredible and really displayed Chinese History and Culture through the centuries. Excellent experience.
"In addition to the Antiquarium, we visited three more art galleries. The first one was the Hall of Literary Glory (Wenhua dian 文華殿) Pottery Gallery. It was located to the right after crossing the Gold Water Bridge. Beautiful potteries were displayed there. We then, returned to the central axis and headed towards the Hall of Martial Valour (Wuying dian 武英殿) Paintings Gallery. But unfortunately it was closed for restoration. These galleries didn’t require additional admission fees.
The third one was the Hall for Ancestry Worship (Fengxian dian 奉先殿) Clock and Watch Gallery. It was located between the Antiquarium and the Inner Court in the central axis. I noticed that from this gate, the names of the halls and gates were written in Manchu script first (to the right) and the traditional Chinese characters (to the left). I was looking forward to visiting the gallery, as I had seen many rare clocks working in a Youtube video. But they were all standing still without ticking or the attached figures not moving. The only exception was a clock twinkling at 12:00noon. It was very disappointing. There was a video screen in the gallery showing how some of the clocks were actually working."
"Huge place to see. Be prepared for lots of walking. Going with a guide is a must to understand everything and get access to some buildings.
The architecture and construction is amazing for buildings so old."
"This is one occasion where I'd suggest limiting ticket sales. The whole complex is far too busy to enjoy any of the area. Packed with large tour groups and guides with loud speakers. I'd rarely suggest skipping an attraction but I felt the time could have been spent somewhere quieter.

The complex is very pretty and quite well maintained."
A massive place to walk around. Our guide was very good at telling us about the history of the place. A few gates to go through before entering the main palace area. We had free time to walk around and take photos. Lots of people around but easy going.
"Massive area of chinese culture.
Even if you try to just cross it without stopping, you will take longer than 1h!"
Its a massive space to walk and impressive architecturally but I wasn't able to fully appreciate it without knowing Chinese history. I'd do it as part of a tour with a guide rather than individually if i did it again. I had the audio guide but didn't find it enlightening. Very Minimal english signage. The spaces are not displayed in their traditional purposes and many are turned into gift shops. Bring walking shoes and passports.
"If you can buy your tickets online otherwise you queue in the exposed weather conditions for the ticket office to open at 830am..the same time the doors open and everyone else charges through. You will need your passport to get a ticket and there are heavy security checks on the street outside and before you enter so just do it.

Once you are through the main gates get out of the sunami of people flowing through the middle towards the main buildings and enjoy some space and quiet to absorb where you are. When you are ready to be pushed and pushed steel youself and catch a small glimpse into the huge halls before being swept away from the doorway. You can't go into these buildings, hence the madness of looking in, its a little disappointing but it preserves it..so. Theres lots of side streets..a few shops for souvenirs and food and toilets you may want to carry some tissues just incase.

Its an amazing place..its seen a lot in its time..so respect it and allow it your time and you will leave happily."
"This is a ton of walking with not much to show for it. Visiting the city consists of walking through courtyards to look at several rectangular ""palaces"" that separate the courtyards. You cannot go into the palaces. Nice to see; but, in my book not worth the effort. Look at pictures online :)."
"This was the residence of the Emperor in the movie ""The last Emperor"". It requires a bout a two to three mile walk to see it all. The buildings are not open to the public, only the courtyard areas are open. This is a massive complex, so wear good comfortable shoes."
"This is a worderfull palace to visit. Don't forged to bring mineral water and umbrella when you want to visit this place. There are so many point of place you can take a picture. So many.
In this place we can see the meeting room and others room that is used by the king and his family such as the king's wife and his mother bed room.
It take minimal a half day to visit this place. If you like a natural scenery you will be boring in this place after you take a half of this place. Because this place have only a little garden inside. But if you like history and traditional architecture, you will enjoy this place very much."
"The actual space that this consumes is vast... so be prepared to walk quite a bit.

There are many different buildings to look at and areas to take in.
It's quite remarkable the space this landmark occupied...the ancient wooden structures are similar looking, so it becomes a little tedious after some time to see similar architecture, but in different proportions.

You must try and make sure you time this right so you won't be swept up in the tides of tourists.
There are many, and it does become somewhat of a competition when it comes to queuing up.

The Forbidden City is good to see, but I don't think you will kick yourself if you don't get to see it.

Recommended? Yes, if you need to fill up time...make sure you see other big ticket items first."
"We entered on the Tinaman square entrance. Be prepared to show your passport. Be prepared for large crowds. Be prepared if it is a hot or smoggy day, or both. They sell water inside, but i would recommend bringing a bottle with you. If you can take a guided tour, that is a good idea, otherwise, they have headsets which are helpful. Be sure to walk all the way to the end. The final area where the emperor lived is a beautiful garden. You can also exit from the final courtyard, so you do not have to worry about walking all the way back. However, plan to grab a taxi to get back to your car, or have your driver come around and meet you at the exit from the forbidden city."
"Obviously this is a huge part of Beijing. It is very large so be prepared to do some walking. Move the buildings you can't go into, but again it is the part of the city you must see. I advise buying tickets online and you need to go in morning. They sell out of tickets around 2pm, and stop taking people in at 4, and close at 5."
Chinese imperial palace from the Ming dynasty... and it has lot of history behind it ...it's massive place and take long walk across from city centre ... worth a walk and have nice building across it ... please see the images in night view ...
"Forbidden City is a place to visit during a day tour and you can't see all of it. The place is gigantic! You have to buy a ticket to visit the city, so bring your passaport with you to do it. We visit one of the sections during a week day (avoid weekends) and the Clock Hall. It was a sunny day and extremely hot but we love the visit! The complex consists of 980 buildings and it was the Chinese imperial palace from the Ming dinasty to the end of the Qing dinasty. It was a day of pure history and culture!"
"The majority of this site is made of huge open areas. Not particularly interesting (at least compared to the Summer Palace). Once you get through the palace to the side with trees, it is more varied. Still, worth the visit. Our guide rushed us through the site unfortunately, so possibly there were more interesting areas we simply skipped, it's hard to say."
"We were part of a Wendy Wu tour and had an excellent guide ""Mick"" to explain the rich history of the attraction. Take 2-3 hours to visit this attraction and note that much of the tour is outside in the sun on hot day. A parasol or hat is essential and take your selfie stick if you want photos: most of the spots for looking into the palace museum rooms are packed so the stick comes in handy for getting a photo over the crowd (which usually do not move and tend to stay in the front for along time). Assume the worst behaviour from some tourists who will jostle for a position and not give anybody else a turn. One of our tour group was unimpressed by the fact that you could not enter any buildings and had to settle for a view of the room from the outside over other people's heads. This is where Mick was invaluable: explaining the history, layout and purpose of each building. I saw people with yellow earphones on a self-guided tour, so perhaps explore that option if you plan to visit."
"The forbidden city is one of the most amazing structures we have seen till date, the Sheer size and scale of this complex is unbelievable! It is very well maintained.
However it is not wheelchair friendly all the way, the right side of the complex does have wheelchair friendly access at selected parts but not in quite a lot of places,my husband and I ended up lugging the pram with our sleeping toddler in it - up and down the multitude of stairs between the huge complex.
The gift shops are good and trustworthy, I would recommend buying souvenirs from these places as the prices are fixed and the quality of the stuff is good too - unlike in the pearl market or the silk alley markets where they jack up the prices 5-10 times more than it's worth and the quality is also not as great!
Wear comfortable shoes and clothes as it can get very tiring and take loads of water- there are multiple shops selling water ice creams etc too."
compared to all the other things in Beijing this does seem average to me. it was PACKED and although beautiful does get a little repetitive in design as you walk through. however you should still give it an hour or so to walk through and enjoy.
It is amazing. The size is incredible . So massive to see it all. What a experience . Highly recommend
"This is really more of a 3.5 stars. It's interesting and full of history but there wasn't a lot of information available about it's significance. We did not get a guide or audio tour. There were some signs in English, but mostly it was walking around looking at historical buildings. You can't go in any of them (or at least we didn't find any to go into). If you are truly interested in this, I suggest getting a guide or audio guide.

Also, the entire experience is outdoors - get ready for the sun, heat, or rain. There are a few places to sit down but not many. Bring water. If you need a break from the heat, go into the clock building (it's cool in there and was worth the fee just for that).

We went in early September and it was a little crowded but not too bad. We arrived around noon and there was a little line. We spent 2 hours and breezed through. You must enter at the South Gate (note: there is a security check and ID check about a block away before you get in). You generally exit at the North Gate but I heard you can also exit at the East Gate.

Important tip: Foreigners need a passport to purchase tickets. It is closed on Mondays except for July and August which is peak tourist season (Chinese schools are out July 1 - August 31, which results in a massive surge of tourists). Maps are NOT provided so you'll need to bring your own (guidebook, download and print out ahead of time) or as a last resort you can take a photo of the map when you enter."
"The only other place I've visited so far in Beijing with crushing crowds was the Great Wall. So if you're planning to visit the Forbidden Palace, be prepared! Get there early, pack light, and get ready to be crushed by crowds.

The ticket to get in was 60RMB. Not too bad, because this place is HUGE. You could easily spend a whole day walking around and checking out all the little outposts in the Palace.

Word of warning, I paid the extra 10RMB to check out the palace treasures - it was pretty poor in terms of what was on display. I was in there for about 5 minutes and had seen everything.

There's lots to eat and drink in here, prices are also very reasonable. Plenty of toilets and amenities.

I'd recommend that you wear comfortable shoes as there's lots of walking to be done in here and in the Palace surrounds.

When you're done here, I'd recommend following the signs from the East gate to Wanfujing, it's about 5 minutes away.

You will need to show proof of id when you come here, so have your passport or identification card handy."
The uniformity and the scale of the forbidden city is incredible. I will admit that we did not go and see every single building as they become quite same-y after 30 or so but it is an incredible place. Everyone seems to warn you about the queues and we were told that if we didn't go at the crack of dawn the tickets would be sold out. Not sure what all the fuss is about - we arrived at about 9 am and walked straight up to the ticket office and then straight into the city area (after a quick security check). Be sure to climb the hill behind the forbidden city so you can get a 'bird's eye view' of it afterwards.
"The largest palace ever built and it shows the history and luxury enjoyed by the emperors back in the day. At one time only members of the imperial court were allowed inside, so indeed a fascinating place.
It was huge!!! and really crowded so give yourself lots of time to explore the whole place (1 to 2 hours). Our English speaking guide was very helpful, but I guess you could also purchase the audio guide. It was smoking hot!!! in August so a hat, sunglasses and bottles of water are essentials (frozen popsicles sold inside were heaven sent – next to the spot where you can dress the kids as an Emperor or concubine and take pics).
Be sure to book tickets online, in advance and pick up at the shorter queue to the east of the entrance."
Amazing place. Luckily the queues weren't too bad. Expect to do a lot of walking. Recommend doing behai park afterwards
"You absolutely must book online. Queues for tickets at the gate are huge and there are limited tickets, selling out at approx 11am each day.

If you book online you collect your ticket from a different queue (look out for it) to the East of the entrance area. In the high season the queue will still only have 4-5 people in it.

Once in, I recommend the audio tour. It's excellent and plays automatically as you walk around past various landmarks.

Leave 2 hours or so to do the Forbidden City."
"The most striking thing about the Forbidden Palace is the sheer magnitude of the place. You keep walking and walking and walking, and continuously discovering new halls and pavillons, all with the same red walls and yellow roofs."
Yes it is a long walk to visit this place completely...but I am sure it is worth the entirety of the walk...very nice place...entry fee a bit high
I enjoyed my time at the Forbidden City and would recommend that people attend while in Beijing. It's a must see although I found it to be a little daunting. It was huge and you could probably spend all day there. We went after lunch on a Tuesday and had a personal guide with us - very necessary. There is signage but I probably wouldn't have recognized the impact of what I was seeing without the guide.
The Forbidden City is huge and easy to get lost. You could spend a long time here but with other things to see two to three hours should be enough
the forbidden city was built almost 600 years ago. it has huge plazas and a stream running through with marble bridges and typical chinese architecture. if you are interested in a cultural experience this should be on your list
"Loved the Forbidden City, few tips. Get there early, buy your tickets ahead of time. If you did not buy your tickets ahead of time, double check you are buying tickets to the Forbidden City because you maybe paying to Tian'an Men instead of the great wall. When you come out it is hard to get cabs because you need to called them like an UBER and the train is not near. Bring comfortable shoes it is a long walk but worth it."
"Its an amazing place to get a very brief understanding on the Imperial of China, how the emperors and the royal family lived. Avoid peak periods, best to go at weird hours like lunch hour or late afternoon to avoid tour groups. Dependent on luck, but it usually gets hazy in winter. Best to enter on a bright day to stroll through and busk in the grandeur of the place."
"This is a fascinating place to see. It is a must for every visitor to Beijing. It is the largest palace ever built. It shows the glorious history and luxurious set ups by emperors over ancient times. At one time only members of the imperial court were allowed inside.
Give a lot of time to explore the whole experience. The weather was hot make sure you have your hat, sunglasses and a bottle of water. It is fantastic place to visit. Never to be missed."
"We went in the November, thinking it's late autumn and there would be less crowded. How wrong we were. The place is massive and it was so crowded, it's impossible to take a photo without having a stranger taken with you. Of course the palace is impressive, but many of the areas are fenced up and there are always hundreds of people crowded infront of you, making hard to get close for a look. All I can remember is that we rushed from one venue to another. I would recommended good walking shoes if you intend to visit this place. I heard that the place would be less crowded during winter. Maybe I would drop by again next time in Jan, when it's so cold no one would visit."
"Although a very hot and crowded experience, this is history all visitors should see. Would prefer though if it were possible to enter some of the important buildings although this is not possible. Take plenty of water, hats/sunscreen and be prepared to be slow getting around as seems always crowded."
"Initially this place seems quite fantastic, but after a while it begins to get a bit more of the same. We didn't do the whole thing as we started to get a bit bored as well as tired of the crowds. We would go through one set of gates to find more courtyards and more temples/palaces, thru that to yet more gates, courtyards etc.
it was crowded, and getting tickets was difficult as they reached capacity. The police move in and push out anyone not already in line.
Getting out of the forbidden city was difficult and confusing, it took us an hour to find an exit!
But remember the Chinese school holidays are July and August so tourist areas are more crowded than usual, travel then at your peril!"
"This place is the essence of Beijing but don't forget your passports to gain entrance, from September onwards admittance tickets can only be gained by there website.
Remember to get here early has it quickly fills with tour groups and can get hectic."
"Whether here on pleasure or business it's a must see.
Take your time, wear comfy shoes and take water.
It's endlessly fascinating as you pass through one imperial gate after another. Allow a min 2 hours - more if you can."
"Take your time and comfy shoes and water. Endlessly fascinating as you pass through one empirial gate after another.
Allow a min 2 hours."
"Top attraction and crowded because it's interesting; huge in size and volume; many sites and various special structures; displays and exhibits covering history and information; remarkable architecture and design. Near Tiananmen Square makes it the daily double in attractions for the area. Must see! Photo opportunities are in abundance. Worth spending a day to see all that this attraction has to offer! Try it, you won't be disappointed. Easy to get to by subway or cab."
Be ready to walk and get mesmerized. Beautiful palace and extremely well maintained place. Never travel here in the month of august. Its super super super crowded
"Huge and interesting. I got definite Mulan vibes, which is great. Guides are great for explaining the history!"
"Warning - this place is huge - allow plenty of time and be prepared to walk (a lot!). A massive place of palace structures (not an eye-catchy grandeur, however, given that this was Emperor's residence). Immense history behind each building and structure. Unfortunately not many exhibits in English, which makes a bit difficult to navigate.

1- Buy a book ahead of time which explains the structures and detail, which may be helpful.
2- Get an audio guide at the entrance
3- Don't follow the crowd's path, try to take different routes than the ones followed by the crowd. for eg. go around the some of the buildings.
4- Gift shop really frivolous - they try to sell you stuff that you can buy elsewhere for a fraction of the price ... nothing special about it either.
5- Beware of pickpockets near the entrances
6- Most of all, allow plenty of time
7- Carry plenty of water on hot summer days and umbrella

Good Luck and Enjoy."
"Beatiful and magnificent are two adjectives that do not describe properly the forbidden city.
After you walk though the great gate you jump back to the time of ancient emperor dinasty.
Your path along each gate carry you close to the armony and so on...
All the building are well maintained and restored ...
To buy ticket you need to provide passport...to enjoy the tour I suggest to arrive early in the morning because the line for buying ticket is really long..."
"you should go early in the morning. the place is very beutifal, bit lots of people are visiting and the amount per day is limited. an amaizing expericnce. but my previous visit there was more impressive and longer."
Forbidden City is huge at covering an area around 180 acres and is one of the largest palce complex. Be prepared for a long day out and to walk and explore the area
"We did a day tour of the Forbidden City and it was very cool. I learned a TON and it was very amazing to see and learn about all the history behind the place.

Definitely recommend a guided tour because there's so much to see. I would have missed so much, I'm sure without our guide."
"Must visit when in Beijing, but be wary of touts and cheats. Take the train as it is the most convenient. Not recommended for people with joint problems. Toilets are filthy, please visit your hotel toilets before coming."
"A wonderful insight into China past and present. Explore the labyrinth of buildings, understand the structure and the history, the details and characters and just people watch. Fantastic."
"I visited by September, Crowd, Sun, then the Country was preparing for National Day, However; and despite all that, this is a Must go when you are in Beijing with the National Library, hall, and other surrounding places.
Be prepared for 5km+ walk, don't take the audio tour nor a tour, most of them just repeat same jibberish things. Instead, do a little research before traveling to China and find your way."
"it worth seeing but before you go take a look at the opening hours ανδ Wear comfortable shoes as you have to walk a lot!I walked alone without a guide.
Eventhough it was great, I would recommend going with a guide. It really is helpful to have a guide explain the stories behind the site and tell you about the important historical parts in the forbidden city."
"The forbidden city is a palace museum open for public more or less all day long. Its a huge area. To understand it please hire a guide, well worth it"
"Prepare for crowds but that does not detract from your visit. I would strongly recommend a guide to explain what you are looking at, although they did offer audio guides. Also, like most places we visited, wear comfortable shoes as there is A LOT of walking.

The architecture is incredible and the place is massive. We loved the gardens at the back.

Our guide pointed out the little things like which bridge or path was reserved only for the Emperor or nobles, and what each building was used for.

I thought that our guide did a smart move by having us enter near the opposite side of Tiananmen Square so that we avoided the crowded entrance, got to walk through the Square and take pictures in front of the main buildings and monuments and then enter the Forbidden City."
"The queue to get in was vast but well worth it as the crowds spread out once inside. An incredible experience to share a part of this special history. we also ate in the old ice house restaurant, the duck in particular was delicious! Sometimes a pity not to be able to enter palace buildings but understandable to preserve these ancient structures from the crowds."
"One of my favorite films is Bertolucci's ""The Last Emperor"" (which talks about the life of Pu Yi, the last emperor of China). It is a glimpse into a portion of the long history of Imperial China and provides us with a glimpse into the life in what we commonly call today as ""The Forbidden City."" Since then I have wanted to travel to Beijing and visit the place.

The former ""Forbidden City"" is now a Palace Museum open to the public (usually from 8:30 AM up to 5:00 PM). The area is huge! It is rectangular in shape measuring 921 to 753 meters from North to South. It is surrounded by 7.9 meter high walls and a moat. Inside you'll find 980 buildings with almost 9000 rooms! Some of the royal chambers have been converted into museums, that display spectacular collections! Brace yourself up for a long walk!

The Palace Museum was established in 1925 and is now one of the most prestigious museums in the world. It used to house the imperial palace of two consecutive dynasties - the Ming (1368-1644) and the Qing (1644-1911). Each building you'll find inside the complex was designed for specific functions and built in accordance with the traditional Chinese architecture that reflects imperial power and authority. You'll be amazed by the intricate designs of the structures and the various symbols they are decorated with. A real feast for the eyes!

You will need a whole day or even more to visit the entire Palace Museum. Be sure to have a good guide book and map with you when you go there. You can also avail of an audio guide. There are eateries in the place, gift shops, luggage deposit, rest rooms, a clinic and an ATM window. Admission ticket costs only 40 yuan = US$ 6 (from November to March) and 60 yuan = US$ 9 (from April to October)."
"We walked to the F.city from our hotel, and did not hire a guide. There were many confusing things about access to it..both entering and exiting the F.City itself. I think going directly to the south entrance area is the best bet. We went to the east entrance because it was closer for us not knowing we would be routed to the south end. you can only enter through the main southern gate and exit via the side gates or the north. We wanted to exit to the south so after going all the way to the north gate on the inside of the F.C, we returned down the opposite side of the compound all the way to the south end not knowing we could not exit there. Once we realized that, we walked back north to the east gate. But then we wanted to go to Tianamen square. so we asked someone at the east gate if we could get there by walking along the canal to the park on the map just below the South Gate to the F.C. The guard told us this would work but that was not true. you cannot get to Tianamen square this way. Bottom line..you can enter F.C. from the south but you cannot exit that way period even once you are outside of the gated entrance security area where you show your tickets. so we had to walk back up again along the river/canal to the east gate area and then down the street south towards the square again. WE do not speak Chinese and got bad instructions from people all along the way. this will make no sense to anyone not looking at a map but once you look, do take note.

All that said, the F.City itself if very impressive. Even with the crowds of Chinese, it is easy to get away from the crowds off to the sides of things. the north end in the imperial garden area however was very very congested. so be ready. we rented the English headset and it was okay although not that much more informative than the signs at each exhibit and it was out of date about some of the special exhibits."
The place is hugh and still has some color. It feels like many miles of walking especially if you have traversed the Tian'anmin Square first. While the guides expound on the great history of the dynasty and replacement of the same now it is well packaged and the interesting details are lacking. Beware of the smog in hot sun. Most locals have the Beijing cough or hack which isn't prevented by the face masks nor contained to this northern region by any means.
"Amazing history displayed very well, the compound is massive but it is great to see the respect the Chinese have for a part of their history that came to an end pretty violently for the Chinese society!"
We took a guided tour here and this proved to be a smart move as the City sprawls over 70 hectares!! Much of it looks similar so it would be easy to get lost. The other tip is to get tickets in advance as the queues can be huge and the locals aren't noted for waiting their turn!
"Interesting place to visit, but very crowded making it difficult to get around and to see things. We went on a Saturday. Perhaps if you visited on a weekday it might be less crowded."
So very interesting. Expect lots of walking as it is huge. I would suggest a guide (which we had) to learn the history.
"The forbidden city is simply a must visit. Architecture, art and history all rolled into one. I recommend a guide or audio guide to get the full experience"
This is probably the most tourist attraction In Beijing. It is very crowded in long lines to get into see. Be prepared to walk great distances and few stairs. But it is worth it if you were in Beijing. The deeper you go the more inside the more you will see and also the better. Several different areas before you get to the actual city itself. One of the places in Beijing. A must go.
"A warning first of all, exit signs are difficult to find and the exit is in the middle!

Visited here and it is spectacular, very very busy but the ticketing and entrance process was ok, we walked around clockwise and finished up back at the start to be told there was no exit here, tried for 30 minutes to find a way out, it is confusing but it is in the Middle sand it is like a maze, not easy! The crowds are ridiculous but by early afternoon the locals were all sittin gin the shade or lying down sleeping and you can move around much better"
"I suggest getting here as early as it opens as the crowds are fierce. You will need your passport to get in if you are not a citizen. We went right when it opened. We started by checking out Tianeman Square across the street then headed into the city. We finished by walking across the street from the exit and paying the minimal entry fee to get into the park and walked up to the viewing where you can get a better perspective of The Forbidden City. We were so glad we did this although we were tired from all of the walking.
Note: don't try and do this in the reverse with the park first because you can only enter the city from the one side."
The Forbidden City is huge and has so many stories inside... from the amazing architecture to the massive expanse of the whole courtyard. The guarding Stone Lions are just in it's self reason to visit
"This is a must see, and there's loads to see and it takes a long time with plenty of walking, there's also loads of people so getting your pics done can take patients but well worth it"
"A must visit place in Beijing.

Crowds are everywhere, but preferably not following the crowds. For example, there are many ticket counters. But the crowds gathered at the first few counters. We walked a few steps further and could get out entrance tickets very quickly.

We walked slowly from one end to the other. It took about three hours.

Upon exit, we took the tour bus to go back to Qianmen. This was good during the hot day."
"Forbidden city is the biggest palace ever created. Now only a portion of it remains, but still there are more than 8000 rooms with about 1000 buildings. Go early because you need at least 3 hours"
"It rained all day the day we went here, I think we probably only scratched the surface of what is here, but the crowds were so insane I'm glad we only spent a couple hours. Our guide luckily was great at navigating the crowd and lines with us. One visit is enough, I definitely wouldn't go back here, and honestly if I didn't suffer from FOMO, I probably could have just gone to Tieneman to take picks of the outside of it instead."
We travelled here as part of a group tour. I found the history to be fascinating as provided by our tour guide. I would definitely recommend wearing comfortable shoes when visiting. It is a very large site to wander around and discover with lots of stairs and uneven ground. We noticed some people paid for a wheelchair service which would be highly recommended if you fitness levels were low or mobility was in any way impaired. I believe this service was reasonably priced also. Like most attractions in China you will have to battle the crowds.
"9999.5 rooms, Construction lasted 14 years and employed the work of 100,000 skilled artisans and up to a million labourers, The scale of it is unsurpassed. The beauty of the gardens are truly amazing."
"A must see while in Beijing. We booked a fantastic tour guide who was very thorough but not pedantic, so we has a great time, learned a lot, and left not feeling too tired. :)"
"Good place, plenty to look at and a lot to learn. Not the best place for young children but otherwise good. Loads of ques so go early."
"The amount of history here is pretty incredible. I'm not a huge history nut, but yet wasn't about to not spend a good chunk of time here. You really do need to allow hours--it's not a quick in and out type of visit. Wear good shoes as you'll do a lot of walking--the place is huge! Expect a lot of people also. Note that student pricing is available if you have ID."
"If you're in Beijing, Forbidden City should be on your list of sites to see. The architecture is amazing and the history is interesting. We did not do a tour so we were able to take our time and appreciate the place, but I could see how doing a tour may be more informative because pretty much everything is in Chinese. If you don't do a tour, I'd advise going early in the morning to get your tickets. The first day we tried to get in we got there around noon and they had already sold out for the day. Also, when you exit the City there will be a lot of rickshaw drivers trying to get your business, watch out because some of them will try to hustle you for more money."
"From Vietnam, we are really really impressed of its enormous dimensions. Everything is huge and beautiful. Highly recommend to see in Beijing."
"We went without a tour guide & managed fine, please note you need your passports to purchase tickets, every day they release 80,000 tickets and these we have been told are sold out by late morning, note you need to plan your time to allow coming through Tiananmen Square to access the forbidden city, once in the queue it took 15 minutes. The site is vast & we paid for the audio tour - don't bother it didn't work. The buildings are just stunning. We were some of the only white Europeans there so be prepared for people staring at you! Also be prepared for the locals to burp in your face, cough without covering there mouths and hawking & spitting everywhere!!! The garden area is beautiful, well worth the visit."
"Given the history behind this place, I was very excited prior to the visit. I am a big fan of historical places and a visit to the great wall a day before heightened my expectations. However, in reality the place is so crowded that its almost impossible to appreciate the history. The repetitive motifs and couryards felt a bit meaningless especially when compared to some of the other historical sites around the world (e.g. Petra, taj mahal, egyptian temples etc). At the entrance you see a massive portrait of Mao, which i found bizarre too. Overall, its nice to tick the box but wouldn't be returning for another visit"
"I am a huge fan of the history of this place and keeping it's meaning in Beijings history in mind, it was a cool place to visit. However we went there Sunday around 11, which we anticipated would be one of the more crowded times, and it was insanely full. The buildings were nice to see, the area is huge. However to me, they all looked very similar and the ""wow"" effect didn't last very long. Walking was extremely slow and tiring because there were so many people you couldn't move around freely whatsoever. A lot of people actually took pictures of us without asking, which made us feel like some sort of alien-animal, which made the whole experience feel rather bothersome.

I much preferred looking down on the forbidden City from the hill located behind it the evening before. That was quite magical."
"When you're in Beijing, you must see the Forbidden City. I was impressed with how beautiful and large the site was. We had a tour guide who was very informative about the site and the lives of the emperors."
"Visited as part of a tour group in August, the busiest tine of the year. If visiting individually you could queue for up to 3 hours to get in. Fortunately the tour took us straight through. Impressive architecture but squashed like sardines if you wanted a glimpse inside. Then too dark to take a meaningful photograph. Interesting but buildings very alike. Far too busy and a shame we could only see the outside. Recommend visiting at a different time of year."
We were impressed by the sheer size and number of the buildings. The history is amazing. We would definitely recommend having a private tour guide to get the background history. The only downfall was the number f people.
"Where is Forbidden City?
1. At the heart of Beijing China. You can even see it on Beijing map.
2. Accessible to subways (line 1)
3. This palace is facing Tian'men Square where you can see the frozen lying body of General Mao.
4. Near to Wangfujing near to World Trade Center
5. Open space, wide and crowded at weekends

Best time to visit, What you need to know:
1. Free to go inside but some parts needs to pay.
2. Many vendors inside (food and bling bling)
3. Old traditional Chinese emperor houses and structures but reconstructed
4. Bring umbrellas or summer hats when it's summer.
5. Best time to visit: Autumn and Spring
6. Avoid weekends or big China holidays, even local people love this place.
7. The palace (Forbidden City) is surrounded by a canal or river-like, try to discover this path, long walk but then you can see the corners and places around. Great for photowalk.
8. There's a hill that faces the back side of this palace. It's called Jinshian Park. Climb this and you will have an eye-view of Beijing and Forbidden City. Choose a clear sky day or else it's just haze and smog you gonna see.
9. Bring camera and video cameras all the time, many interesting scenes to capture.

I can't upload videos, sorry."
"All of these places are worth seeing while in Beijing, it was awesome. You arrive here after seeing Tiananmen Square."
"This place just has so much history. You cannot tske it all in in a short time.
The museum gas so much to share with its visitors. Well maintained and vlean"
We enjoyed this trip. Great Chinese history and great spits to take pics. If you are in China take a tour of the Forbidden City.
This a really interesting 1 day visit in Beijing.This place with more than 800 buildings shows the rich chinese culture.For sure is a place to go!!
You could spend days in here! We only had an hour to quickly go through it :) but it was worth it to see it even for a short amount of time!
"This was my second trip to the Forbidden City. Five years ago it was as free. This time there was a fee and they limit the number of admissions per day. My Chinese colleague suggested that I pay the admission fee on line, several days in advance, to guarantee admission. The on line ticket site was only in Chinese and only took Chinese credit cards, so my colleague made the purchase for me. The instructions weren't clear about where to claim my ticket but did say that I would need my passport to identify myself. Once I got to the south entrance of the Forbidden City, I followed the crowd until I saw one sign to the left side of the first or second courtyard that said ""Tickets"" in English. There were about 12 lines with a large number of people in each. It took about 30 minutes to reach the front of the line, only to learn that it was the line for people without on line purchases. I was directed to a small building on the right side of the courtyard near the entrance to the next courtyard to the north. At that building, there was a ticket window that had a ""Passport"" sign pasted on the window. There was only one group in front of me and I quickly retrieved my entrance ticket.

Many of the exhibits in the clock and ceramics halls are only in Chinese. Most of the major buildings have large signs in both Chinese and English describing the significance of the building. You can also rent a audio tour device that gives you an explanation, in over a dozen languages, tailored to your current location. You can take any route through the Forbidden City and a map on the back of the audio tour device shows you which major areas you have not visited yet."
The Forbidden city is worth seeing and it should be booked a part of a package. The tour will require a lot of walking so be prepared to walk.
"Susan was a geat guide. Really. She gave us a lot of information about the history, the details of the palace and the buildings, and she always waited for us, giving us time to take photos and to look around. She answered kindly to all our questions and she was really prepared. This is not a fake tour where they try to sell you souvenirs taking you to shops instead of letting you visit a place that most likely you will see once in your lifetime (I had many of this kind of false tours) this was a real tour and me and my wife were really satisfied about that."
"it was a great experience for me to be in a forbidden city!
you can know a lot about Chinese history.I recommend to read about this place at first and then go.this place needs at least 2 hours."
"We walked to the forbidden city via Tianamen Square. Not a lot to see in the square but ticked a box. However the city is amazing though VERY busy. We went with a guide who spoke excellent English and was invaluable.

I can understand why this is Chinas no 1 attraction."
"I guess there is nothing new I could say about the forbidden city itself, it's truly amazing.
One advice that can really help is too be there really early (or book online, but I do not know the procedure for it...), best to be at the ticket booths at 8 am.
The booths open at 08:30, but there is a limitation of 80,000 tickets per day. We talked to other tourists that day who told us that the ticket booths were already closed when they arrived at 09:15, so get up early and go for it ;-)
Also take into account that there are several security checks before you can get in, so some additional time might be needed to get to the entrance."
"The Forbidden City, closed to foreigners for centuries, is simply one of the most impressive, beautiful and overwhelming places I've ever seen. It's a massive palace complex built centuries ago for the Chinese royal family. The scale and attention to detail is hard to fathom. There are stunning views everywhere you look. You need to count on a full half day to truly explore all that is here. This is definitely a ""must see"" attraction if you are in or near Beijing. We went in March and the crowds really were not that bad, so try and go in the ""off season"" to avoid the major crowds and the heat. It was a pleasant day in the 50's F when we visited."
"at the entrance to the forbidden city is a huge portrait of chairman mao he looks looks across the road and he sees the enormous tinamen square probably spelt this wrong.you enter across a bridge over a moat and go through a very large archway.inside it is an enormous area it seems endless walk further and you see the square in which the last emperor was partly filmed ther is a great deal of historical things to see to endless to remember them all but i can ensure they are sights to be seen and held in your memory.plenty to be photographed it is an enormous place it just goes on and on from one square to another.plenty of people visit here. so much to see of the history of china in this period. i cannot think of enough words to describe this gigantic place only by visiting it. can you justify my thoughts of this place i visited this place in 2000 but the when did you visit doesnt have those dates on it i have been back to china many times and seen many things but you must not just stick to the tourist places if you can do this. xian , guialin. shanghai, are worth seeing too. but has i have said i have been to many places in china"
"The Forbidden City is special and it is worthwhile to purchase the additional tickets to access the outlining museums. You could not go inside the palace rooms where the family lived. I was disappointed, you could enter historical places elsewhere in the world equal in importance. It also needs a little care. The museum displays need clean up. There are places which could easily be restored to its greater potential. The investment would definitely be worthwhile."
"even arriving at first time in the morning , the crowd (mostly chinesse) is overwelming , the visit was , for this reason very stressfull , no tour gides available in other languages than chinesse on site, very poor organization,"
"Take a history tour with Joe through the imperial home of the Emperors.
Great information. The Forbidden City is huge so you get to see a great sample of rooms, temples and to understand the political life and daily life of the ruling class. Enough time and well paced for 30 people including children."
"I visited the Forbidden City with my wife and 11 year old son in June 2017. It was hot and crowded even early in the morning. Cooling towels are highly recommended.

But maybe most important, especially with kids in tow, is to have a private guide. We had Jessie of Tours by Jessie (highly recommended) show us around Beijing for two days and her accompanying us through the Forbidden City was invaluable. Without a guide, the area is just a series of Chinese buildings and whatnot; with a guide you get in depth info on everything you might be interested in. Your kids can ask silly but practical questions. You'll learn the significance of the dragon statues and animals on the corners of the roofs of the buildings; who lived where and when etc. etc. She also knew where the restrooms and snack bars were, no small thing.

We spent about two or three hours walking through the Forbidden City and gardens. I can't say it was fun, but it was interesting and informative and our son seemed to get something out of it. When we got home it was interesting to watch the movie The Last Emperor because it takes place mostly in the Forbidden City and it brought it to life a little for us.

All in all the Forbidden City is an obvious must do attraction in Beijing. But the average person will get much more out of it by hiring a guide."
"The history of the place is amazing. Just to be there and see it. We had a private tour guide, which is advisable"
"Really impressive and relatively inexpensive for admission if you don't get a guide. Get there early they only allow 80,000 in per day. In the summer they hit that by the afternoon."
"A full day out with lots of little attractions added. Do not under estimate how many people will be here! Pre-book your tickets don't wait until the day, you will queue for ages and be disappointed."
"The Forbidden city is a must see in Beijing.

It's absolute beautiful and it's an icon of historical China. We visited the Forbidden City for approx 2 hours with a private tour guide. The place was super busy and super hot in the summer. Our tour guide did a fantastic job telling us about the history of the place and the stories/legends surrounding the people who lived there."
"This is horrendously busy. But tough it is well worth it. Breathtaking architecture. Ok history at its finest. Huge area.

Tickets sell FAST so don't go too late. Follow the crowds to the entrance.

Lot of walking so wear comfortable shoes.

Drinks and snacks expensive here so bring your own. And no sun shade here so wear a hat on a sunny day."
It's a place you will want to see on your first trip to China. From this location you have an understanding of all things China.
"Great for history buffs, and not horribly expensive. We saw pottery that was 8000 years old! Fascinating stories and architecture! You HAVE to have your passport to get in which would have been useful information. Plan on waiting in line (or get there very early) at both security and for tickets. I think you could buy tickets online, which might have been helpful. We waited. The area is much bigger than we thought, and you could easily kill a day or two without seeing everything. I think it's worth the lines and admission."
"We didn't realise how large the area the forbidden city covered. It is an amazing place to visit, a must.
It was hot on the day we visited so wear comfortable clothes and shoes. So vast with loads to see. A beautiful and memorable place to visit."
"A myriad of visitors and a myriad of colours greeted us. Blues, yellows, reds and greens...to bring to mind that Royalty once lived here. Some beautiful carved sculptures of legendary animals can be seen closer to the entrance.

Don't forget to take a look at the throne room and the King's throne, but you would have to stretch and take a photograph, since no one is allowed inside."
I m happy to visit forbidden city in a nice weather. Its so prefect for phototaking but just so many visitors especially for leading a group. But there are different exhibitions which are in Air con venue. You may spend half day. Visiting with a guide is recommended.
"We visited here as part of a guided tour. Only 6 in our group, so we were able to move around easily. What an incredible place. When you stand in the courtyard you can hardly believe you are in such an iconic place. Interesting history and stories as you wander around. Be prepared to do lots of walking, this place is enormous!"
"The Forbidden City is such an iconic part of old China and Beijing. Any visit to Beijing must include a trip to the Forbidden City to get a feel for the old China and the massive size and layout of the court.

We toured as part of a private guided tour and spent at least 2 hours, barely scratching the surface. The size of the area and the rich history means that you would need days or weeks to see it all.

The old houses for the Emperor and the Concubines are a must to see.

Try to pick your time but beware that as it is so popular you will be dealing with tours of domestic and foreign tourists everywhere."
I would say the forbidden city is bit of a marketing gymic. I nothing much to see but well organized. I say their are less crowded better places in china to see.
"My wife and I went on a guided tour of the Forbidden City and were blown away with the history, architecture and stories involved with this location. I could not believe how large it was."
"We were lucky enough to be on a 3 day tour of Beijing that had been organised by Wendy Wu Tours at the end of our cruise. We were picked up early in the morning and taken to Tiananmen Square and from there we entered the Forbidden Palace. It was HUGE. As we were taken from one palace to another we were told about each one. It was busy, but imagine that later on in the day it would have been even busier as we are led to believe that many Chinese will stay for the whole day. It was great being able to see and feel the atmosphere of the place, but would have loved to be inside some of the buildings, but appreciate that to preserve them, then that would not always be possible."
"Make sure you plan a full day here. Get here early; long lines at ticket office. If you purchase a ticket on line, you will have to still get tickets at the service window, which can be choatic.

Once in the city, plan to spend 6-8 hours to see the key buildings and general architectural quality. It is a tremendous representation of thousands of years of Chinese civilization."
"Well worth a visit, give yourself a few hours and bring a picnic , The boat trips are fairly inexpensive"
"It was a thrill to stand in the courtyard I have seen in so many movies. The gift shop was also excellent. (I wish I had bought things there when I had a chance.) There were many hawkers between Tianmen gate and the Museum entrance. The audio guides added a great deal to the experience. I'm glad I went, but I probably wouldn't go again. It was grander in my imagination."
"The Forbidden City simply has to be seen to be believed. it is an utterly majestic place with an incredible history. I don't think |I have ever seen anywhere as grand or on this scale. The temples are jaw dropping. It is an absolute must-see when in Beijing.
Make sure you bring your passport, you need it to gain entrance. Make sure too that you get there as early as you can. We were there before the first tickets were sold and even at that stage it was absolutely packed. As the morning worse on, the size of the crowds were unbelievable, I honestly don't think I have ever been at any attraction that was as crowded. Also, make sure you set aside at least half a day,m the complex is absolutely enormous. The central courtyards, temples and stupas will take you hours to see properly but if you go to the side chapels and side museums, you will not feel a whole day slip by!
The guided tour earphones are well worth paying for as the place is so huge in scale that I don't think you will get as much out of it without the commentary."
"If you want to be one of a billion camera clicking sweating crowed, that's the place for you.
You cannot get inside most exhibition shows (only look from outside the windows), it's very crowded & other than mark it as 'Done' I don't see the point."
"Please remember that they will close on every Monday, it's a place where you can sense some sad stories, a place where you can feel the symbol of power ..."
"While the Forbidden City is a must visit historical site that is one of the most amazing places in the world, unfortunately the entrance tickets are not sufficiently managed such that the crowds substantially detract from the experience and make the visitor just want to get through and out as quickly as possible. Obviously understandable to want to allow as many people as possible to see this treasure, but it would be safer and more enjoyable if they instituted a more controlled entrance policy."
"So of course your expectations are huge when you are going to the Forbidden Palace, because it is forbidden, but I couldn't help feeling let down. The Emperors must be rolling in their graves as the commoners have overrun the place.
No trouble getting in between 8:30-9 on a Friday, but you will be joined by tens of thousands of other visitors. The audio guide is a waste of money as the narrator is expressionless, all the buildings look the same and you can't get into any of them, just peer in the door with a hundred people jostling you for position.
The visit would be improved if it was set up with furnishings, decorations, greenery, etcetera so you could see what it would have looked like when it was a palace.
Of course you have to go because it is the forbidden palace after all, but don't despair if you can't get in, go to the workers cultural palace next door, same buildings, one of which you can get into, nearly deserted except for brides getting their wedding photos done and a whole lot more pleasant."
"Oh my what an amazing place! I loved it (though my husband less so!)
So much history but I would highly recommend a tour guide to get all the information behind just looking at the buildings
Loved it!"
Our whole family loved touring the forbidden city and seeing exactly how the Emperor lived and dealt with the government on a daily / weekly basis.
"Visited here on our recent trip to Beijing. What an amazing site! A must see for all who visit China. You need at least 2 hours and be prepared to walk a lot. It's exhausting, particularly in the summer heat, but well worth the visit. Take an umbrella, sunscreen, hat and plenty of water if visiting in summer. Also very crowded at this time.

I believe they run out of tickets when it's crowded so worth booking online."
"Situated in the centre of Beijing, the complex covers over 250 acres and has 9000 rooms.
Once through the gate there is a huge courtyard surrounded by buildings and once through that the complex goes on and on.
A fascinating insight into Chinese history and culture.
Be sure to have walking shoes and plenty of water, the complex is always crowded and very hot in summer.
A must see."
"If you have watched the movie the last emperior you will recognise the setting. Spacious palace grounds in a garden setting. Interesting museum looking at the life of the emperor.

Unfortunately it was school holidays with lots of school kids.

Very hot and humid in July. Did not realize it was achool holidays"
"Beautiful Palaces, I went in May de weather was hot but not unbearable, lots of people, avoid the first week of May as lost of Chinese take their vacations so you can expect big jams, you will do a lot of walking comfortable shoes are a must. This part of the Chinese History is a must to see"
"Forbidden city is located in the center of Beijing city. It was also known as imperial palace and was the home of emperors & center of ceremonies for emperors and Chinese government from Ming dynasty to Qing dynasty for over 500 years.
It includes many palaces and gardens. There are 980 wooden buildings and 9999 rooms filled with ancient artifacts in the forbidden city. The city is surrounded by walls and have many gates inside.
This is the most popular tourist attraction in China. The entrance is from Tiananmen square and has outer court, inner court and gardens. There is hall of supreme harmony and palace of heavenly peace. The palace museum is one of the largest cultural museums and is one of the 3 ancient palaces in China. The entry ticket is 60 yuan. You would need to walk a lot and you can easily spend few hours at this site."
"I've lived in Beijing for 27 years. Have probably visited the Forbidden City (Gu Goong) a dozen times. Each time there is an unexplored or new section opened. Never tire of reading and re reading the history behind each major pavilion. Truly is a must see experience. Definitely check out the ''çlock museum"". You can no longer enter from the North nor South Gates..so plan at least a 10 minute walk from where the taxi driver drops you off. Buying tickets is allot easier than ever before with adequate signage in English. The walking audio guide may be helpful on your first or second visit. You don't need to spend extra money on a personal guide. The straight walk thru depending on your stamina can take approximately one hour... but it's nice to get off the beaten path and explore a bit so allow a liesurly two hours +.You could spend 5 full days and not capture the entire museum adequately. Weekends and holidays are jammed packed with locals and the crowds can get to some foreigners, so my advice is plan for a Monday thru Wednesday activity day if possible and preferably in the mornings...You won't get lost; You will have fun: and You will come out of the experience much more enlightened re the culture of China."
"We were there during the Chinese summer holidays and it was packed and blazing hot. Still, it was stunning and fascinating. We didn't linger due to the heat but enjoyed the audio guide."
"It's a must-see, but it is a long walk. It's helpful to have a tour guide to explain the significance of some of the buildings.

Also if you're black, you're like a mini celebrity and many of the tourist wanted to take a picture with us. I am not sure if it's because they don't see many black people or they thought we were celebrities. I was also told if you have blonde hair and blue eyes you also have celebrity status."
"First impressions - Its a pain to get in (unless you're with a tourist group, for which they have a separate entry), since the lines seem endless and clearing the security can easily take an hour during rush hours. Second, its huge & grand.

Its one of the largest imperial palace complexes in the world and within its perimeter houses multiple palaces and royal residences. The architecture is impressive and the place is well maintained and clean. If you're not with a guide / guided tour, do take a Audio Guide (available at the entrance near the ticket office), else you'll just be lost and make little sense of things around you. And be prepared to walk a lot. Seeing the entire place (and there are a couple of museums inside for which you need to buy a separate entrance ticket inside) can easily take 2 - 3 hrs, if not more. Do carry some water, and wear comfortable walking shoes.

By the way, its just across the road from the Tiananmen Square. So club a visit together."
"This is so well kept and such a beautiful example of Chinese architecture. Went there at the beginning of September. Hot as hell and very crowded but I mean, that's something you should consider before visiting."
"It gets crazy busy so get your tickets early at this time of year, online is a good option. Once they sell about 80,000 tickets for the day they close ticket sales.
Despite the crowds the palace is so vast it is a beautiful place to go.
The history and architecture are fabulous.
Be prepared for lots of walking and have plenty of fluids.
We've been a few times and always manage to discover something new to see.
Fabulous place."
"This one of the must see attractions in Beijing because of the history it holds. Its just across from Tiananmen Square, very very crowded and need your passport to get in. Just outside is the Iconic Mao Zedong picture. There are lots of beautiful architecture and gardens and places where the emperor used to live. It is very big, bring umbrella for the sun, comfortable shoes. We got tickets online which turned out to be very smart cause the lines to get tickets were absurd at 10 am. We had tried the day before at 4 pm but there were no more tickets available that day so it is recommendable to go early."
"I booked and paid for an after 12p.m. ticket through, I believe, a Hong Kong agency via PayPal. I arrived at 1245p.m. and it took a good 30 minutes of queuing to get through security and the crowds to where I could collect my ticket. Anyone can get through to the ticket office area hence the mass of people at the start. The instructions to collect the ticket were slightly vague and is just before the actual ticket check to go into the Forbidden City. There are some small windows set back to the east with no queues. I handed my passport over and a ticket was printed. There was very little delay going through the ticket barrier and more security. The site is huge. I had downloaded information and a map beforehand but lots of people had maps and the audio description headphones. Some areas are closed for renovation but everything is well signposted. There are plenty of bathroom facilities, shops, refreshment stands etc. in the main parts and back streets. Prices were ok for drinks. It's an incredibly busy attraction and there's lots of bumping into people! The side streets are quieter and I often found myself in an area with no one else. I spent 3 hours wandering which was enough to see the main sections and lots of the side palaces. Exiting was simple and I went out the east exit which took me straight to a favourite coffee shop to recover!"
This place is amazing. You want to go early for reduced crowds but the ticketing system and security checks are efficient and pretty quick. Put on some comfortable shoes because this place is huge with so much to see and experience
"If you are in Bejing this is a must. It is amazing just to walk around and with a guide or audio guide even more.
We only had 1½ hours and that simply wasn't enough."
"The Forbidden City is a must-do if you are traveling to Beijing. Be prepared for the super large crowds of people. We used Peter with Catherine Lu Tours and he was able to navigate us easily as to where to go to avoid a lot of people. Sometimes that is unavoidable but it is what it is.
Forbidden City, also known as the Palace Museum, once served as the imperial palace for 24 emperors during the Ming and Qing Dynasties (1368 - 1911). It was first built throughout 14 years during the reign of Emperor Chengzu in the Ming Dynasty (1368-1644). Ancient Chinese Astronomers believed that the Purple Star (Polaris) was in the center of heaven and the Heavenly Emperor lived in the Purple Palace. The Palace for the emperor on earth was so called the Purple City. It was forbidden to enter without special permission of the emperor. Hence its name 'The Purple Forbidden City', usually 'The Forbidden City'. Now known as the Palace Museum, it is to the north of Tiananmen Square. Rectangular in shape, it is the world's largest palace complex and covers 74 hectares."
"Definitely an eye opener ! You must have some knowledge of the History to appreciate the place.

You need your imagination to put yourself into those time of the various emperors who lived there with their numerous family members, courtiers, servants, etc.

Just slowly explore and look at the exquisite carvings on the roof, doors etc.

Be prepared to arm yourself with the audio guide, map of the place and explore the place for at least 3-4 hours."
"If in Beijing it's definitely a must see, but I wouldn't got to Beijing especially for this. It is an iconic and very important location, but there are many other places in China that should be higher on the list of priorities.

Expect hoards of Chinese tourists no matter when you go."
"This is perhaps the most popular attraction in beijing. There are a lot of people in beijing!
It is quite centrally located and opposite tian amin square.We could not be bothered queuing to get tickets to go inside."
"Walk from Tiananmen Square into the Forbidden City.
Walking into the Forbidden City feels like you're walking through some temple with wall into a copy of that into another copy of that and so forth. Didn't feel to me that special. The history behind it is quite interesting though.
It might be a nice peaceful stroll if it weren't for the ridiculous amount of tourists. Every day, all day."
"Very busy in July when I went but still incredible.
The buildings are amazing and a must visit for anyone visiting Beijing.

I watched a documentary about it just before I went, and then to see it in person, just wow."
"Visited twice within a few days. The first day we entered and walked to the entrance to the Palace only to find out it is closed on Mondays! Returned as part of our Grand Circle Tour and was able to get into the inner part of the Palace. 30 years ago, this was blocked off because they were making the movie, The Last Emperor"".

The Palace is a spectacular display of how the Chinese Emperor's lived and ruled in the past. It is maintained as if the Emperor would walk through the door today. Very impressive."
It is beautiful and very large. Gorgeous vistas from each high point. Worth at least 3-4 hours. Don't go in the summer when hot and crowded.
"If you have seen Last Emperor or not, you must visit this place - it's a top category, probably the most interesting place in Beijing.
As Forbidden City is really crowded, you should either order tickets on line in advancece or come early in the morning."
"Great experience. We went without a guide or audio tour and still enjoyed the architecture. There is some signage around that provides some information. Would recommend going early, passport is required when buying a ticket, take some water and sunscreen as can be quite hot walking around."
"As with all advice given, go early and expect people. Despite this, it's a must do so just relax and take your time. Beyond the beautiful structures there are many side court yards and garden areas. We went to the last empiors school, given we had seen the movie ahead of time, it was something for the boys interest that the guide thought of. We also enjoyed seeing the last Empiors mother's bedroom.

If you are staying within walking distance the mote is worth a cost a dusk, you can watch locals fishing and stroll around the outside walls."
"Interesting to see and learn about the Forbidden City - home of Chinese royalty. We weren't able to go inside the buildings, but saw lots of palaces. Beautiful carvings and artwork on the buildings. Interesting to see the original as well as restored. The gardens were lovely. Just a warning - some of the toilets were 1 star. Be sure to bring your own tp! Summer crowds with school children, locals, tourists, heat, and humidity. July is not the best time to visit, but this is a place worth seeing!"
"If you want to feel a real Peking this place is must to see.
Spirit of Chinese emperor is there.Anyway place is very crowded."
Make sure you allow plenty of time and invest in a guide also be prepared for excessive crowds. Arrive early and be wary of scam artists circling otherwise extremely worth while
"Forbidden City ( 紫禁城 ) has been the capital & home for Emperors of both the Ming & the Ching Dynasty for almost 500 years. If you are into Chinese history & literature, this is the place to visit, either in Spring or in Autumn when weather is not too cold or too hot. But please try to avoid both local Public Holidays & weekends as the crowds are impossibly huge. And it is a huge place so be prepared to walk all day but it is well worth it. For those who are interested to view the historical individual imperial treasures or items , please keep an eye out on the Museum website as to when there will be a Gallery display. Of course you can go to Taipei & view a good proportion of those historical individual imperial treasures or items @ the 'Forbidden City Museum' there. Nonetheless, Forbidden City is a magnet for all age , especially Photographers ,with its Pavilions, halls, carving & architecture."
It was a great place to visit and I was part of a tour group so had a guide telling us all about it. It was nice walk and it reminded me of the old chinese movies my dad watched as the architecture in the place was in these times. I learn a lot about the history of it from the guide and it was a great thing to go see again.
"We went without a guide and got to the ticket office well before opening as we understand there is only a small percentage of tickets available to the general public (as in, not in a tour group or internet booking).
So, we got our tickets and followed the sea of umbrellas into the museum/forbidden city.
The structure itself and the architecture are very impressive, along with the special exhibition but the rest was very disappointing. We've traveled Asia for a few months now and have seen countless amount of temples. We were expecting this to be the pinnacle of everything we had seen but found nearly all the exhibitions and, artifacts and rooms to look at so incredibly dusty, dirty and generally unloved. Of course you also have to deal with the hu dress of tourists pushing and shoving (but this is expected).
All in all, it is a must see if you are in China but manage your expectations. :)"
"Make sure you are rested and have great walking shoes. This attraction is very large and with so much to see you really need to be prepared. First, do not take water with you as it is cheap and easy to get there - and you will need it. With 9,999 rooms and covering 72 hectares-about 178 acres, you will want to spend the day here. The people are so accomodating even if they do not speak English. Make sure you do some research as you cannot see the whole thing so pick and chose what you want to see. The history of this World Heritage Site, built in the years 1406 to 1420 is incredible and you will leave with a feeling of awe and happiness. If you can, watch the movie The Last Emperor before you go. Parts of it were filmed on site. One last bit of information. When traveling to China remember they have a lot of Eastern toilettes, meaning take your own toilette paper with you. And learn to aim. Enjoy !"
A must-see attraction in Beijing. As soon as you enter this former residence of the Chinese emperor you feel small like never before...
"This place is huge so be sure to have a local guide. Fabulous history and a lot of walking, but simply amazing to see in person."
"This is a magnificient legacy from history. But too many visitors and it needs maintenance and renovation of walls and doors. This is my 3rd visits (1983,1990 and 2016). This is a palace but not yet an actual museum although some small quarters there are exhibiting antiques and displaying stories about the palace. etc. The Forbidden-City is closed on Mondays."
I love to visit places to learn a lot of history and I have to say it was wonderful to go around and I would highly recommend this place to anyway that loves history and always wants to learn more about the history of different countries
"Via Tiananmen East you walk on the pavement on the right and will be screened by security.

Towards Tiananmen square crowds of visitors were streaming in the summer heat of 37degrees with umbrellas, hats and battery operated/charger fans with mists which can be purchased at Wanfujing souveniur shops @ S$3.

Seniors can enjoy 50% discount on their entrance fee ...I had my passport on my mobile phone. Equipped with bottles of water and gd UV screen cream we braved the summer crowd of school kids, locals and tourists.

We moved from palaces to palaces and the architecture were all awesome and grand. It has won the UNESCO award for the architecture and preserved wood.

Majority of the relics and halls were barricaded with steel bars. 35yrs ago we could go in the halls and only the furniture were barricaded. Now majority of us were struggling to get a glimpse and photoshooting at a distance.

The palace museum is vast and now you exit from the back and not the entrance. When you exit do not turn right where the buggies are as you have to pay Rmb2 and the queue is long. Just walk straight to the traffic light and it is 900meters to Wanfujing street.

Enjoy this great museum."
"This is always a must visit be be prepared to queue.
Taxis are cheap and plentiful and this is quite central to the city. (Taxis only take cash) insist on using the meter some will try and set a fixed fee but it's always cheaper metered to get around."
If you visit Beijing you should visit the forbidden city it is an amazing place to visit and discover the empire palace of the china it is a historical place I recommend every one to visit it
"What struck me most was the size of the place. One went from one palace to the next crossing vast open squares with little bridges.
There are several places of interest off the main palaces including the gardens.
We went on an extremely hot day which was quite challenging.
You have to queue for quite some time to buy tickets to enter.
Be prepared for a lot of walking.
Worth the effort."
Like so many things in China its hard to fathom the scale until you actually see it in real life. This is a great example of this. Spent 3-4 hours going through as much as possible. It seems to go on forever. The level of detail in some of the frames around windows & doors etc is incredible. Worth visit and will go again.
As the name implies this huge series of palaces within a vast enclosed area well protected was indeed forbidden for men to enter. The security around the place was high. Tourists can enter now and walk around the estate. There are several identical palaces with uniform spacing around. However the guidance to tourists inside with directional boards and brief history is missing. Considering that the place now attracts international tourists some focus here needed. The historic place is very well maintained.
"The place very well organized a lot of ppl said that you could go early because of the tickets are always very busy well it's not that bad you can go anytime you will not going to wait more then 20 minutes but the place worth every single moment if you have long vacation I do recommend to stay the whole day there it's really amazing

You can reach there by taxi and very important note take your passport wherever you go"
The size of the forbidden city is impressive. Very well organized. We bought online tickets and it was difficult to find the counter to exchange the verification code to the tickets as there was no clear signage. Suggest you just line up and buy the tickets there
"I first visited the Forbidden City in 2002 and was overawed by the scale and wonder of the place and have since been back several times.

I seem to spend about a third of my life in Beijing so when my friends visit I tend to be the person who shows them around town, hence so many trips to the Forbidden City.

It is never boring and I seem to see something new each time.

So tips:

1) Set aside the whole day if you want to really enjoy it. In truth you will spend about 5 or 6 hours there but will not have the energy to do much afterwards
2) Try and read some background before you go. This is a huge and complex place - it is not called City for no reason - so understanding some basics helps.
3) If you like such things you can hire ""tour guide"" headsets - they drive me crazy but they could help.
4) Explore the whole site. If you have missed the ceramics museum for example, you have missed a lot of the site.
5) Take drinks and snacks and toilet paper!

To understand its role in China's history, I would try and watch the BBC TV series, The Story of China. This is, in my humble opinion, a brilliant and engaging overview of China's many histories"
"Recently I had a brief window of opportunity to visit the Forbidden City and a few other sites during a weekend in between my business trips. There are a few lessons learned that I wish to share based on my experience that I wish someone told me before I went. I'm hoping that this will help you have a better experience than I did!

Try not to visit Beijing in July - it is incredibly hot!! If you must, do wear a hat or follow the locals' queue and have a parasol. It is a must.

Allow a day for visiting the Forbidden City. The complex is massive!

If you can, have a guide! If not, do pay for the audio guide. It will be worth it.

There is virtually no signage in any language other than Mandarin, and I was only able to find one person who spoke a tiny bit of English - he worked in the visitors center and I swear without his help, I'd still be trying to find my way out!

Speaking of the way out - it is on the other side of the complex, so no need trying to memorize the way you got in (I wish I knew that!). If you have a driver - ask them to pick you up on that side - not on Tianmen Square! There is one other exit, about a third of the way in, but you need a map to figure out how to get out to where you need to go. If you are trying to get back to the Square, you'll have to follow the river and counter-intuitively follow the canal in the opposite direction through a park, which will then drop you off in a shady street, which you will have to follow for quite some time before you reach the Square.

Do visit the museums (like the jewelry treasury) as you see them - the way the complex is structured, you won't want (or be able to) come back. My biggest regret is not visiting them!

You can truly enjoy the complex if you plan well. Dress appropriately, bring water and snacks, and plan your visit and transportation plan.

Good luck!"
It was amazing to be there and see the history but if you don't have a great tour guide (I recommend Jenny from Tour Beijing see my review for their info) to help you get past all the lines quickly...you will wait forever. Large crowds and pushy people. For me the Great Wall was worth spending all day instead of the Forbidden City.
"I went to Forbidden city while my short stopover stay in Beijing. You pass the main bridge and gate and get the ticket (please note that once you enter, you can only exit from the very end of it.) Nobody speaks English but signs are in English. Senior people are half price so don’t miss the cheap deal if you are over 60. And dont forget to carry your ID or passport.
There are some steps, but the whole site can be accessed easily if travelling with children or elderly people.
The shrines and temples are just beautiful. If only wasn’t so crowded, you could get amazing photos, The whole visit took us around 3 hours, but if you want to see in details every temple, you may take longer or you can quickly walk in in 2 hours. The gardens at the end are beautiful so don’t miss them.
Shops inside are quite pricey so I wouldn’t recommend getting any souvenirs inside and also pack your drinks and snack before in advance.
as my favourite meal in Beijing, great food, great service and at a really cheap price!"
The entry fee was high. The place is vast but almost empty. There is nothing much to see because everything was taken away when the rulers moved to Taiwan. It is very difficult to be guided as there are no sign boards. The staff members do not know English so if people are lost due to huge crowd finding them is not easy.
"OK we saw the movie ""The Last Emperor "" and one always thinks 'Hollywood exaggerates ' but it's only when you see this place that you understand the lifestyle and power of the Emperors. The scale is massive and just when you think you've seen it all there's another huge courtyard and more buildings..... it just goes on and on! Lots of walking and steps up and down. Bring water!!!!! The stone and rock gardens are impressive too."
"This is another must see site in Beijing. Get a guise and explore the outer court, inner court and palaces. Imagine yourself the emperor in the 15th Century. The buildings are stuffed with history but I enjoyed the Imperial Flower Garden, north of the inner palaces, complete with a rock garden. Read about the history before/during your visit."
"This place is best explored with a guide or at least a guidebook. Without one or the other you will miss the significance of many of the buildings, their features and historical context.

The density of the crowds will vary depending on the weather and the day - early morning on a week day is best. Be prepared for plenty of walking but there are many places to sit and rest when needed."
"The palace is beautiful, but inside there were many areas sectioned off and not much to see, besides the exterior of the buildings."
Forbidden City is a must-see in Beijing. The architecture is striking. It is a very large place and often crowded so be prepared to do lots of walking.
"Perhaps the most important piece of advice is this : bring your passport. You actually need it to buy entrance ticket.
It's impossible to go be dropped by car/taxi anywhere near Tian An Men or Forbidden City's main entrance. So it's the same walking distance whether you go there by taxi or underground MRT.
Safety screening might cause a long queue.
They know put an explaination sig boards at every important stop, explaining things both in chinese and english.
We arrived today at almost 3pm, resulting in a rushed tour. To fully enjoy it I'd say you'll need 3 hours minimum.
Beijing is full with great historical monuments, but this is definitely the must see place in town.
If you finish at 5, with (it seems) everybody else, be prepared to fight for taxi. Or just take private car / black taxi. They'll charge you more but generally it's safe."
"This is a must see if you are in Beijing! The architechture alone is awesome! Add the relics, sculpture and gardens and it is spectacular! I used the gps English audio guide as I wandered through the grounds. It had the narration for the East and West palaces reversed so, I was pretty confused for part of it. There is a good deal of written description in English which is how I figured out that the audio was backwards. Expect heavy crowds if you visit in the summer."
"This place was very interesting where emperors and leaders of China used to live. You have to do a lot of walking, and they charge you for every little section to see. It was very hot that day so my opinion isn't as high as it probably could be but nonetheless it was very interesting. I'll check this off my list."
When you visit please set aside enough time for walking around there is so much to see... plan on booking with a reputable tour company when you do go.. there are usually very large crowds in the summer months. Overall a very lovely experience enjoy and take lots of pics :)
"In my two weeks in China, this was the busiest and most difficult to navigate sight of all I visited. Standing in line for hours, undergoing rigid security checks, and pushing through the palace with thousands of others was a bit taxing in the scorching heat of my July visit. Bring good shoes for lots of walking, cover your head and body against the sun, and hydrate sufficiently."
"This is a historic landmark and is a must visit for any traveler to Beijing but beware of very, very large crows. The place is a mess and decorum is not a virtue practice by many locals, be prepared to be push and shove but if you can look pass that it is a beautiful place full of culture and history."
"I was amazed by structural and architectural of Forbidden City. There is audio guide to rent with various language which will help you a lot. Forbidden city was so huge and full of people everyday so make sure you reach there as early as possible because there is quota of 80k to enter this relic.

The best way to get here is by subway
Take subway line 1, get off at Tiananmen East Station (Exit A) or Tiananmen West Station (Exit B), find the Tiananmen Tower, and then walk north to the Meridian Gate or Take subway line 2, get off at Qianmen Station (Exit A), walk north through the Tiananmen Square, pass the Tiananmen Tower, and then find the Meridian Gate further north.

Admission fee: CNY 60"
"Beautiful place but doesn't have any tree at all cuz they were afraid of attacks .
But if you can walk a lot (that I couldn't 😂)there are a lot gardens and beautiful trees .
There is the king palace that was placed on 40 miters alabaster."
"Of course if you are in Beijing you have to visit it and I'm not saying you shouldn't. Unfortunately the site gets so crowded that it's very hard to grasp anything remotely connected to its past atmosphere. My mistake was not to hire a guide because probably it could have helped a bit. But it's really difficult to appreciate the place, being continuously pushed around and queuing. I went early but it wasn't enough..."
"The palace itself is very interesting and beautiful. However I would not recommend going in the summer. The lines to get in were very long and even once inside the museum, there were hoards of people everywhere. The 98°F heat did not help.

In addition, I was disappointed that there were some exhibits that cost extra money on top of the admission cost. I'm not sure I understand why you can't pay for everything upfront. There are GPS audio guides available in several languages. The English one was fine but didn't always play when it was supposed to.

Forbidden City is still a must-do if you visit Beijing but I recommend planning out the parts you want to visit and avoiding summer if you can."
Hard to comprehend the number of buildings in this place. All geometrically lined up. Crowds were large. Get used to being amongst a lot of people.
Just go to the Jingshan Park and enjoy the view to the Forbidden City from there. Or get ready to spend the whole day in exploring all the countless details.
"This is a stunning place to visit but had problems using a wheelchair around as this is an old structure and the large slabs up to the main ticket checking station are not wheelchair friendly to the point of us nearly breaking the front wheels on the chair. Once in, the disabled routed takes you round the right side of the area meaning you miss very large sections."
"You can learn quite a bit about the history of China and their Emperors by visiting the Forbidden City.
This place is a huge indoor/outdoor museum.
Unbelievable artifacts!
I recommend spending the day here as there is so much to see.
Very impressive!"
"If you come to Beijing there are a couple of things you cannot miss. One of them is the Forbidden City. Ancient Palaces of the Emperors Dynasties. It is a great place to enjoy with a local guide who knows about the important history of the country. You will learn about the wooden buildings, their way of living, their internal fights, the battles, their wife and their thousand of concubines, the princesses and the cultural way they treated men and women. Impressive and at the same time unforgettable."
"I visited the Forbidden City on a Monday morning thinking that the crowds would be arriving later in the day. The place was packed, the majority of the visitors were Chinese. The queues were very long. Be prepared for a lot of people to push in, not bothering to queue up"
great place to go! such a busy place! avast area full of tourists as i say do go see the Clocks and jewels
Was great seeing this along with the great wall. We had a great time seeing this history and learning about the different sections of the city and meaning of the architectural pieces ad history of construction.
The Forbidden City is HUGE! Wear comfortable shoes no be ready for crowds. What an amazing bit of China's history. Go up the very first building for a view of Tian'anmen Square. Near the end of your tour take the time to see the concubine quarters.
I think only visiting this palace is worth to go Beijing! You would find a lot about china’s culture and their relic. the area is very large and I recommend to go there with a guide for the first time. It is likely to lost or miss to visit all the rooms. We visit there in summer and the weather was so hot and damp. In order to relies the soul of this masterpiece it is better to read about the landscape architecture before going there.
"We visited the forbidden city in july, very hot day! Interesting to see, but you only get to see the ""showrooms"" and you do not get to go inside. So it is only exterior and that is great! I would like to get a feeling on how they lived, worked etc..."
"Oh my God!! People everywhere and withour guides to direct you to different places. Is a one way visit, starting south, ending north."
"We've always wanted to visit the Forbidden City and it did not disappoint! It's mind boggling to me the sheer size of it all. Crowded, hotter than hades in summer but what a place to visit. If you can't appreciate history then I'm not sure I'd recommend it but if you want to see what life was like for a Chinese Emperor... Don't miss it!"
"Very large complex that consist of many palaces that were build in different times. This main attraction in Beijing is very popular both among local and foreign visitors. In order to get to the ticket counter you will have to pass security check. Hiring a guide for the sightseeing would begetter as an alternative one may also purchase digital guide sold for 10 yuan at the entrance.
The admission fee for the complex is 60 yuan and there is no admission fee for the children under 1,2 meter :). It is advised to dedicate at least half of the day to explore the Forbidden City.
You will encounter some young attractively (usually very open) dressed local girls that usually hang out near Forbidden city area. Most of them will try to communicate with foreign tourists pretending that they would like to learn English. The first thing they do is inviting you for the beer or tea. Please avoid contact with these girls as they intention is not genuine. They work for the cafes and other establishments nearby who grab tourists offering alcohol or tea."
"we went in July and it was 389 degrees and little shade, the crowds were massive and noisy, sadly the tour guides have amplifiers and compete to be the loudest so the noise in a temple is awful, many similar buildings its a must see but not much to see, you definitely need a guide to explain the differences between the buildings as there is not much, difference"
We visited here in one of the hottest days of our trip OMG. But it didn't detract from the shear scale of this beautiful historic gem. It's a must if you are in Beijing. It can be very busy as you'd expect so take your time and soak up the atmosphere.
"A great day out, very busy so go early. It is very large and takes some time to go through. We had a guide and was very helpful. Hard to get taxi outside when finished."
"Go early in the morning as it gets very crowded. Can also get very hot walking around. Very beautiful, take your time looking around."
"Visit early and with a guide (you get to go ahead of the queue). We had the pleasure of being guided through the forbidden city by Panda Holidays guide ""Kitty"" she was exceptionally knowledgeable on this historic area and we definately picked up more than by going it alone. There is quite a bit of walking so be sure to wear comfortable shoes."
"A fascinating place to visit but at times quite overwhelming.
As each empower built their own palace there are many buildings to see in this massive complex.You need a full day to do it justice.
It was very busy on the day we visited. Typical, I thing, for this tourist attraction. You are not allowed in some of the palaces due to the wear & tear caused by countless tourists walking through then. So with some palaces you can only view the rooms from outside. Literally thousands of people trying to do this and take photo's, so you have to push your way to the front if you want to see inside.
The city is so big however that you can find quiet places where you can view less popular buildings.
Take plenty of water with you, if you go in the summer. It was a hot day when we went and places to get a drink we're not that common."
"Bill gave us the history of the Forbidden City in a way that was easy to understand and follow.
Lots of walking but well paced so that it is not tiring."
"It's like reading a history book as you go through this place, every house in it has a story to tell, the admission lines can be quite long, suggest to try to go to his place as early as possible and yes you will need to walk quite a lot so go prepared."
"Come here early in the morning to avoid the ticket sold out. There is not so much of different (in term of crowd/tourists) in the morning or in the afternoon. However, we have noted that its quite lesser people in the late afternoon. We have spent half day here, but it was quite a bit of rush tour. So, we think it should be a whole day tour is the best way to explore the place, including evening walk to the JingShan park (the hill) ahead of the exit (there is only one way in, and one way out). The palace, the courtyard and the nine dragons wall is the main attraction."
This was a great part if the Chinese history but was disappointed that u didn't actually get to see inside of the palaces
A very busy spot but the crowds move quickly. We had a guide and that made things easier and quicker as the knew where to go and what to do. So would recommend this. A big place but you can make it as long or as quick as you like. We spent 2 hours there and that was about right
"Ok it's not quite as clean and maintained as what you expect from watching Bertolucci's masterpiece The Last Emperor but immerse yourself in over 3000 years of Chinese culture!!! You will need hours to explore the millions of glorious ratificará thankfully not destroyed by Mao's infamous ""Cultural revolution"".
Expect thousands literally of tourists and locals alike trying to take perfect selfies. Main rooms must be viewed from a far behind roped entrances. Relics are crammed into glass boxes. Fortunately, most of the Palace treasures are in The Palace Museum in Taipei so the best parts of examples of various Chinese dynasties architecture. A must see!!"
"Beautiful. It deserves the wait, the hot weather, everything. Something you will not forget. Go early!"
"I guess it's a must see in Beijing but it's extremely touristic, so one either has to be particularly passionate and knowledgeable about history of China to ignore the crowds or to have a superb guide to tell all about the history of the Forbidden Palace, otherwise spending too much time at this historic site may prove challenging."
"Expect hordes of Chinese tourists. It is really crowded all the time!

That being said, you can't miss this. It is one of the main attractions in Beijing.

The old architecture is very nice and if is a must see."
"This was beautiful, don't go with a tour, because you only see a very small part of the forbidden city! It takes 4hrs normally to see a lot, with a tour you only spend 1,5 hrs, to sorry was that in my opinion and I was very upset! But what I saw is amazing!"
My son and I visited the Forbidden City and we enjoyed the Palace Museum. It houses a few real gems and jewelry. Not loaded with items but each item is very high quality.
"Just WOW! We only scratched the surface of this sprawling complex of ancient building, terraces, plazas and gardens! Absolutely fantastic! You could easily spend days here soaking up the history and the sheer magnificence of the place! Wish we had more time. Easy to get around!"
"Of course, it's a must go-to spot. But, prepare for crowds and lots of walking. You could find a few smaller temples with similar architecture, but then you couldn't say you've been to the Palace Museum."
"It's alright, but I think it's over rated. It's vast and there's plenty to see, but it gets a little repetitive."
"Went in July when heat and humidity are particularly oppressive. The scale of the place is fantastic, but many of the buildings are inaccessible; the few palaces that are decorated have limited viewing options. There are relatively few signs in English to help you with history, and I overheard that the talking maps you can purchase aren't the easiest to use.

Very very crowded."
"Get in early around 8.30
Definitely get a driver & guide for the day, they speed the process up & will teach you a lot ,
Get them to take you out to lunch & maybe go for a rickshaw ride in the hutongs afterwards"
"We visited on a quick stop over. It was quite easy to get to from the airport.

Harder to get back because Taxi's were reluctant to go to the airport.

Lots to see, you could walk around for a long time."
"Amazing, the history that this place holds in its walls, the beauty of it's gardens and all the treasures that remain, you can imagine the life of the emperors just by looking at the beauty that surrounds each wall."
"We had a 10 hrs layover at Beijing airport. It was the Great Wall or the Forbidden City. I think we made the right choice going to the Forbidden city. Great wall is a one hour drive, very expensive Taxi....Forbidden City is good for 2-3 hrs visit. Good Metro service to and from the airport. The place is fantastic for a tourist who loves history. The whole complex needs a lot of walking so would recommend comfortable shoes and a water bottle. A lot of locals visit the place so be there early and avoid the rush."
"This is one of the best experiences I have done. The forbidden city is so huge, and the history is so interesting. Everything has a specific meaning and the way it was built. Very impressed and would have loved to spend more time there."
"Chinese people call ""Go Gong"". You have to visite onnce in your lifetime.
I'm a chineses's novel fan and this is awesome. Finally I can visited here, took a photo and kept in my memmory."
"We went here later on the day and to our big disappointment, most sights closed after 4 PM. We should've known, but now you're warned to :) But furthermore, perfectly maintained and very impressive. We also had the automatic guide (40 yuan pro person), which we liked very much. Must see!"
"We certainly enjoyed our time in the Forbidden City – The Palace Museum. Being central to the history of Beijing and China there is just so much to take in. We were lucky to have a guide with us, and I recommend that you do take a guide as you get a more concise understanding of the history as opposed to just meandering on your own.

The entry through the archways with the large portrait of Mao Tse-tung is just the start, to a historical journey that includes amazing buildings, carvings, bridges and historical artifacts.

Very impressive to hear of the history of the Emperors, how they lived and what daily life in the court was like.

Definitely do this."
It is worth to spare enough time to check on every sections with plenty of galleries and structures. rather than just go straight in the middle section from gate to gate
"This place is huge make sure you have good walking shoes and a good battery backup for your camera/ phone photos to take everywhere. Drinks and snacks are cheap inside, it's amazing the amount of work that went into this place."
"This time I went with my father and my brother, it is really meaningful for me. I have been to here more than five times, it is very nice for always walking in here, to imagine the stories all happened here!"
"Its fulll of people, going along 3 empty squares, but if You take a risk to turn left and leave common path, You may see some interesting collections."
"It is nearly impossible to describe the magnificence of this palace. The ornateness is endless and beautiful. It seems endless!

It is important to have a good historical overview as it will add perspective to your visit. Wear good walking shoes,

GO EARLY, GO EARLY, GO EARLY....it will be insanely crowded so go early."
"Impressive palaces and history from the Yuen, Ming and Qing Dynasties. We enjoyed and learnt a lot. Be prepared for the crowd, the heat during summer days, and walking. Better to join a guided tour as the place is too big to do by yourself."
"The forbidden city is really cool to see. Make sure you get a map, which are free and bring some form of identification for everyone in order to buy tickets. They scanned our passports when we got there. Once in, we went in the buildings further on the east and west sides to avoid the huge crowds going straight through the main gates. This is where the temples with the special galleries are that you sometimes need to pay extra for ($2CAD/pp/temple). We paid for the clock exhibit and the treasures. The other 2, the painting and calligraphy gallery and the ceramics gallery don't cost extra. The autumn and spring pavilions at the end are a must see! Be prepared to maneuver your way through huge swarms of people. Go early and spend at least 3-4 hours there. There are tons of bathrooms on site though they are just holes in the ground. Bring wet wipes or toilet paper with you. We did rickshaw ride through the hutongs afterwards. There were tons of men who approached us immediately. The listed price was 180rmb/pp for a rickshaw. We got ours for 100rmb total. I would try to get it even slightly lower like 80??"
"6 of us in our party, 3 senior staff and 3 Saudi students who had an absolutely great time. The students felt like celebrities because not many people in China see Saudi women in their Abaya and Hijab so they kept asking for photos (not so good as Saudi women are not allowed to be photographed) but this didn't stop them loving the whole experience 😂"
"My visit to Forbidden City was fabulous, we hired english speaking local guide, Tour was interesting and informative about culture and history of the place, i must admit this place did not lost its originality every detail is intact

Must visit Place if you are in Beijing"
"absolutely you need to visit this place when you in Beijing. it summarize the history of several main dynasty of China. from here, you can strart to learn the Chinese royal family life and many stories happened with historic scenes. better to find a guide to introduce the history and architechtures for you. there are many exibition here quite often. can take the kids to be there for learning the history."
"The forbidden city brought back to life pretty much everything I can remember from old Chinese movies 😃 , esp the Last Emperor . ( must watch movie ) . The different gates leading up to the palace each have a distinct reason and myth behind them and are constructed of wood without using a single nail !!!"
"Wear good walking shoes. Make sure to see the living quarters of royal family - it is an annex near the back gate and stone sculpture garden.
FORBIDDEN PALACE IS CLOSED ON MONDAYS.
Can be difficult to get a taxi once you exit. Be prepared to walk to the nearest subway if you are not with a tour."
"We walked the city for over 4 hours, and according to fitbit around 10 miles. This is an absolutely massive piece of history. Despite the time and distance we put in, we still only saw a small portion of the entire grounds.

We opted for the automated audio tour headset, but it seemed to not work properly.
There are periodic places to buy snacks inside the city.
Bring a couple bottles of water, because you *will* need them."
"I've been here once with a tour group about 10 years ago and this time I traveled with a local. It's so much nicer not being rushed by a tour guide and taking your time to stroll this amazing piece of history. Tickets are about 60 kuai from what I remember and they only sell 8 million tickets a day. When my friend and I got there, it was around 10AM and there was only 2 million tickets left. If we went any later, I'm sure there would be none left. If you're trekking there on your own, I highly recommend getting one of those audio tour guide things so you can actually do more than just strolling the place. The history is crazy and the photo ops are even better. There's virtually no shade anywhere so I would recommend getting an umbrella for the trip. It helps a lot."
"This really is a must see in Beijing but bring your walking shoes!
We visited on a hot Sunday afternoon in June, with 3 teenagers. Yes, they were impressed and liked it. The first half hour or so.
There is little shade and you cannot go into any of the rooms/palaces.
Even though it was pretty busy, the place is so huge that there was plenty of space for everyone!
A guide would probably have been useful to get more out of this visit but we find that, no matter how fantastic the location is, our teenagers do not want to follow a tour guide around."
"Regardless of the rain we still went however, our guide (Selina) wasn't the best and not particularly endearing, however, the structure itself was fantastic."
We enjoyed our visit to the Forbidden City and highly recommend it. Another must see when touring China. March was also a good time to travel and the trees were beginning to blossom.
Costs 60 rmb. Nice to see but not much more than that... You can only see the outside of the buildings which was a little disappointing for me. Avoid going there on weekends because it's very crowded. Also I wouldn't recommend visiting on a super hot day because there's almost no shade.
"This is a place where the Chinese ancient Kings live and work, there are working places and living houses inside, many King's stories.
Too many tourists inside."
This was an amazing place to reflect on the depth of history in this country. Our guide was knowledgeable and hi-lighted many important things regarding the forbidden city.
A huge complex of 999 rooms. Be prepared for a long walk as it is South Gate to North Gate. Lovely gardens and the scale is just humongous. It is beautifully kept and a must see!
"Obviously a must do in Beijing. It does live up to the hype. It can be a very long visit so I suggest you concentrate on areas that are interesting to you. We had a guide and I do think it makes a great deal of difference having that guide. The knowledge makes it much more interesting. Lots of walking. Hot in summer. Very crowded. But there are few places in the world that equals the hype. This place does. We watched ""The Last Emperor"" before our trip and though the movie was a little tedious, and 30 years old, it gave us heaps of context. It is stunning and our 4 teenagers did enjoy it, though it was a long day."
"So the Forbidden City is a huge complex, and is near Tiananmen Square. You will need to get your walking shoes ready, as there will be a lot of walking. There are many parts of this complex, so I tried to take it all in by reading all the posted signs; related to what type of Emperor activities went on in the post 1400's when this was all built. You will go back in time, and learn the significance of numbers, seasons, animals, and the like had on everyday living; for both royalty and commoners.

It is amazing that any of this is still standing (As fire and war impacted the structures), but I will also tell you that there will be many people at all of these sites. I was here in July 2017, and I am told that 80,000 people per day visit! If you don't get a ticket in advance, you will have to get in a long line to enter. The lines are LONG. Try to plan ahead, and I think that will help you out immensely. I did book this tour through Viator, and that made it easy."
"The forbidden city is huge and a visit involves lots of walking. If you have a real interest in the history then it's fantastic. if not then you will tire easily. We had a guide who made it more interesting and adapted the visit to suit the children i.e. we went through it as quickly as possible without getting into the detail or seeing every area. Even though the area is massive, it can still get very crowded. Some great photos - especially of the roofs at different levels ...."
"After making your way through the somewhat chaotic entrance from Tianenmen Square, just keep to the right-hands side and take things slowly and you will find some quiet corners and great opportunities for good photos.

Don't worry about trying to cross the centre bridges and take things at your own pace."
"Knew the forbidden city was large, but until we went there we didn't understand that it was this huge. To explore all of it could take days. So many beautiful buildings. The clock museum was very interesting. A must!"
The forbidden city is great - a real eye opener on Chinese history. We were lucky enough to have a private tour but even just walking through this regal palace is breathtaking. A must see in China.
"The Palace is a great place to visit, and you should plan for at least two hours to get around. It's hard to get away from the work that went into creating such a place-especially when put into the context of it being carried out 700 years ago. It is extremely crowded, as one would expect with such an attraction. There are many historical artefacts and buildings to see, but the highlight for me was the palace garden. The garden is an absolute delight containing four separate areas representing the seasons (spring, summer, autumn and winter), The mountain/viewing platform is an absolute wonder to behold, and it would be difficult to create even today let alone at that point in history. In short a must see, but with huge crowds detracting from the experience."
"I stayed at a hotel near the Forbidden City because I figured that if my time was going to be limited in Beijing, this was the one thing that I absolutely had to do. I was super jet-lagged, so I woke up extremely early and walked over from my hotel. I enjoyed the walk and the scenery, but the smog was really bothering me and I got there before the ticket lines were open, so I just had to wait in line for a really long time until they started selling tickets. There were tons of visitors from all over the world in line and I was a little worried that it would take forever to get a ticket and that it would be super crowded inside, but things actually moved pretty quickly once the ticket counters opened and after you get through the main gates, you can split off from most of the tour groups and go into the quieter parts of the Forbidden City where the tour groups don't go on their speed tours.

I enjoyed my time in the quieter sections and had purchased the audio tour headset since I was alone and wanted to hear more about what I was viewing. If I'm being totally honest, it wasn't really that interesting to me, but I was trying to be attentive to the audio tour.

After a little bit, my audio headset malfunctioned and the audio tour wasn't playing anymore. And then, just as I was about to set foot in the Temple of Tranquility, I got struck down with a terrible overwhelming sense of nausea and had to go sprinting to the bathroom nearby where I became violently ill. I'm pretty sure that was the universe telling me something.

I ended up speed-walking through the rest of the Forbidden City after I had recovered enough to exit the bathrooms. And for the record, if you are about to become very sick, the very last stall in the bathroom has a western toilet. I am pleased that I was able to run past all of the squat toilets to discover a western toilet at the end.

The air continued to bother me, so I ended up putting on one of those masks for the remainder of my visit. My headset started working again about 20 minutes later, but I had pretty much lost interest in hearing much more about the Forbidden City because I was concentrating on making it out without getting sick again.

Overall, I did not enjoy my visit, but I'm going to openly admit that becoming violently ill in the Forbidden City didn't help any."
"Beautiful historic place, I lot of walking and you can't change your mind and go back! It's only one way in and one way out! Interesting history of emperor, make sure you have a good tour guide!"
"This place has great meaning to Chinese people, I went with a tour group so our guide was explaining different stories about the buildings, the place was very nice, just gutted because it was raining 10-15 minutes on our way in, so we had some time to get to the end since everything is one way. The crowds were mainly under shelter and inside the rooms. I did in the views while trying to rush to the end because of the rain. I bet it would have been beautiful on a sunny day, just highly likely to be very hot."
"Guides will make the difference to your experience, otherwise they are just buildings. We learned which entrance the empress will be carried through, the difference between left and right sided entries when facing forward and reasons why etc. Great experience."
"If it is really something you want to do, go visit. But if you are just looking for something to do, the forbidden city is not worth your time. Crazy crowded, and everything basically looks the same. You also have to book tickets in advance and come before 9 to minimise waiting in line."
"Interesting reading the reviews, both good and bad - here's a take from an older person and a history nerd.

The place is central to the history of Beijing and of China - if you want to understand the empire and emperors, you need to see this, in terms of monumental architecture it's fantastic.

It's huge, it's full of buildings, many of the buildings are very similar in look but different in history. Many of the buildings are empty or derelict inside, many you are not allowed into. There are few places to stop for a coffee or a snack, there are few shopping outlets. There is a very nice garden near the north exit.

If you want your history in 3 minute chunks - if you want video supplements - this is going to be a trial for you. If you like to look carefully, read a lot, take time to feel the history, poke into corners and read lots of information boards, and like me, want to get to understand the roots of the culture and the per-revolution history, this is a must see. The guides can be rather dubious in their dedication to the job (some fantastic, others shockingly bad), I suggest you get either a guidebook or the audio commentary instead.

Some tips - take your passport (or a scan thereof or you won't get in).

Don't go on Monday - it's closed.

Get there early - it opens at 8:30, once 80,000 have passed the gate it closes. Many of the buildings have only 2 or 3 viewing doors, they become packed later in the day and it becomes a scrum trying to see in.

Get there early because it can get exceedingly hot around midday to 3 p.m. during the summer.

Take time to read the information plaques, there is a lot of background information on many of the exhibits.

Take time to explore off the central corridor - there are lots of interesting things in the quieter areas.

If you exit from the north gate there is a wonderful park where the material from the excavation for the moat was piled and landscaped, the view from the top is spectacular (pollution permitted).

If you don't want to see this return to the south gate, there are no metro stations close to the North gate and negotiating Chinese buses is a nightmare for a foreigner."
This was a good place to see so many artifacts and treasures. There is so much history in this one place
"The lineups to get inside move fairly quickly. Once inside the crowds fan out and you can walk around at your own pace. NOTE- Foreigners are now required to show their passports in order to purchase tickets. No passport, no ticket."
"Lots of empty buildings separated by vast courtyards, that's the Forbidden City for you. We had a local friend as our guide, and she was fun to have around, but perhaps a paid guide would give you more information. It was boring, to be honest. And crowded."
I was exhausted before reach the end at museum of jewelry and the garden the weather was 35 C and very hot - same type of building repeated again and again
It's obviously a must do attraction in Beijing and I'm not saying not to go. I found it all to be quite average and can't treat it as much more than a nice wander round. There was snippets of interesting info but I didn't feel gripped
"Although not all of the palace rooms are open to the public, you get a great insight into how the emperors lived for over 500 years! It's amazing to see how well restored/maintained it is. It is a lot of walking though, bring plenty of refreshments. Once to get to the emperors rooms head through the doors across the courtyard on the right, there are park benches in the shade... and not a lot of people in the garden :-)"
"Definitely a must go and and sure you will not be disappointed despite the crowd! Love the structure and it was definitely huge that it took us at least 3 hours and I still believe that there i have missed our some parts. Heard from the local that we will need to go in 3 times in order to finish walking round the place. We rented the automated audio guide and it was very helpful in helping us to understand the function of each place. Not forgetting to mention, the souvenirs were all so pretty that I burnt a hole in my pocket."
Sorry but I just don't get it. Why are people pouring in to see this fairly bland and nondescript compound. It's nothing special at all.
"...anywhere really: the scale of this palace complex is breathtaking and dwarfs anything else in East Asia. Sorry Kyoto and Seoul! Yes it's busy, so much more so than I thought, but veer off the central thoroughfares and you can still find - relative - solace. Also, be patient when required and literally pushy when in a huddle of photographers by each gate's viewing gallery: it's not rude, it's the Chinese way it seems. I highly recommend the House of Martial Valour for its stunning collection of traditional calligraphy and the glittering Treasure Collection (an extra 10RMB), both worthy destinations in themselves."
The Forbidden City is an amazing place to visit. So much history to see and digest. It can get very crowded and you have to watch for pickpockets. It requires a lot of walking so if you go in the summer take some water with you. There can be several checkpoints with large crowds. But in the end you'll not regret it and go away with seeing a great piece of China's history.
"The architecture is spectacular, designed to impress visitors and dignitaries since it was built, and now open to everyone with 5 RMB- and patience to stand in line..
The proportions of the interconnected buildings are perfect, and balanced in scale .
One surprise- how small the Emperor's actual sleeping quarters, and audience hall were--possibly for security purposes...?
. Tucked in one of the West wings is a breathtaking collection of Sculpture , including one of the famous Warriors and magnificent horse. Alas , not much time to see what surprises lay in the other rooms...!"
The buildings are old and impressive but there were so many people it was hard to see. There is no line or order when trying to see inside some of the buildings. The entrance was tricky. We would not have found it without our guide. They have security check points everywhere. You entereed across the street from Tian'an Men square and before that you had to go through secrurity on another street just to get to Tian'an Men.
"This place is overwhelmingly crowded. To avoid the very - very! - long and pushy lines at the security checkpoints at the east and west side of the front entrance, instead enter through the park on the west side of the forbidden city (no lines there at all!). You then quickly walk through the park, which is rather nice btw, and enter the city from there. Keep to your left as you walk through the park. You do still have to queue for a ticket, but at least you skipped one line... The ticket office is on your right once you exit the park and enter the square.

We arrived at the park at 8:00 am and were in the ticket queue at 8:10 am, which was already considerable, but got much much longer afterwards."
A heap of tourists so try and go in the shoulder periods. The procession can be a bit tiresome but doesn't remove from the wonder of the scale of this place. Just incredible. BE PREPARED to be shepherded through an unending maze of entries and exits - this for us was the worst part of Tianamen Square and the Forbidden City complex.
u can take train to this place. and the entrance fee is only 60cny I think. but I took the trip advisor package and I regret because I don't have enough time. they travel agent was pushing us because the next stop is the great wall. it is better to go by own. There is a subway stop nearby. thinamen subway
"Words cannot do justice to the spectacle of this place - just get there and see it for yourself. This is, after the Great Wall, probably the most must see sight in China!"
Absolutely stunning architecture! Try to visit the smaller rooms/exhibits at the edge to get away from the huge crowds.
"The enormous crowds visiting this place means that, large as it is, it is very congested and difficult to obtain meaningful views of the interiors of the buildings. The distances are large and in the summer heat and humidity, it was an uncomfortable experience albeit that the whole location is fascinating."
"The history is overwhelming - you can walk and see the entire complex, but plan to stay most of the day. We reserved 2-3 hours and got a great taste of this incredible historic Palace. Do it the same day your visit Tienanmen Square."
"We took a taxi there, but the drop off point for taxis is way to the south of the entrance. You will go through a security check down in this area first. Be prepared for a 20 minute walk in the heat just to get to the first entrance ( the wall with the picture of Mao on it).

Once through the Mao wall, you enter an outer courtyard, where you can buy a ticket (15 RMB). But this isn't the main ticket. We never figured out what this 15 RMB ticket was for! Go inside the next wall, and it here where you buy the main ticket (60 RMB). With this ticket, you go inside a third wall, and that is where your tour really starts ( if your feet are till cooperating).

We used a local licensed tour person who spoke English. She asked for 150 RMB each for the two of us, but settled on 100 RMB each. I think if I did it again, I would use the audio tour devices instead. Look for them past the area where you buy the 60 RMB ticket.

Be prepared for a long walk to get there, and a much longer walk once you get inside. It is huge, and it seems to just keep going, and going, and going. Lots of up and down steps, getting you through various layers of walls and temples."
"An important part of Chinese history and well worth viewing. Be sure to bring lots of water and hats or umbrellas for shade. Note that this venue involves lots of walking and many, many stairs."
"I'm sure in back in the day when this was a bustling royal community it was the place to be. But to be honest, it had several pretty spots but it mostly all looked the same. I'm glad we went to experience it, but not a place I would visit again. I think you have to go see it at least once."
My fiance and I came here on an organised tour. We had about two hours to get through the palace which was ample time. Its such an interesting place steeped in history of about 500 years. Its one of the most historical palaces in the world and a must see place if u go to China. Its situated in the main area in Beijing so close to other main attractions. It has 9999 rooms and is the largest ancient palace in the world. It is 24 times bigger than the Vatican! Amazing! Def see this place to appreciate the Chinese dynasties. Apparently 24 dynasties lived there over 500 years.
"Must see If you are going to Beijing! Amazing buildings and history, although felt a little like ""I saw one building, now I have seen them all"". Get ready for lots If people..."
The Forbidden City and Palaces are all about old China and Beijing. The palaces are well maintained and managed. No queues to wait at all. Also the Forbidden City now opens at least 75% to the public if I am not wrong so visitors need a day or at least 4 hours to be inside the palace. Also visitors can reset easily with a drink. Take your time and let yourself be in the city with the old fashion monarchy style architectures. Wonderful!
"The Forbidden City was my favorite sight that we visited in Beijing. It is so massive that we didn't even see everything. We got there 40 minutes before opening and the queue was already pretty long. They sell a limited amount of tickets each day so it is best to go in the morning. The first hour didn't feel very crowded as there was plenty of space to spread out. About 2 hours in, however, it was so crowded that we couldn't see into the rooms or get any photographs without other people in them. I loved the imperial garden, which is at the end of the City. Unfortunately it was so crowded there that we didn't enjoy it. The Forbidden City is still a must-see place. Even with the crowds it is an amazing sight."
Great place to start your Beijing sightseeing but bring tons of water and snacks to stay fully energized during the warm months. Overall an amazing experience that shouldn't be missed.
"The Forbidden City is huge in area, so many people there. I went on a small group tour on a very hot day.There is no shade there, so quite uncomfortable at times, just wall to wall people!"
A must see in Beijing. The Forbidden City which had the palace of the Emperors of Ming Dynasty and Qing Dynasty is located at the centre of Beijing. It has about 980 building spread over 180 acres. One has to walk long distances to see the various museums.
"take the whole day for it. enjoy the walk, the park on the other side of the forbidden city. this place is like no one else i've visited"
"We spent a couple of hours walking through the different sections of the Forbidden Place and really enjoyed hearing about the history and culture. It is a site to see and experience.

We would recommend this as a place to see during your Beijing trip."
"This is a pilgrimage for many Chinese people which is evident by the sheer number of Chinese that visit this place every year. As a westerner, it was amazing to see the reverence they have for this place. I guided myself with an audio tour and spent around 4 hours walking around but you could easily spend a full day (or more if you are very thorough) here with a guide if have the time. Highly recommended if you have at least the faintest interest in China and its history."
"Forbidden City is well worth a visit. We went on a very hot day, so bring plenty of water and wear a hat.
A lot of the antiques and history has been preserved and you can only imagine the customs and way of life of the Emperors and Concubines and trusted staff( including a doctor who had to taste the Emperors body waste everyday to determine his health.
It's interesting, particularly if you studied Chinese history at school.
Expect a military presence and lots of security in the way of cameras."
"This place is huge! Make sure you allow at least 3-4 hours to just scrape the surface, there is so much to see. This city is beautiful. Beware of the panhandlers if you exit at the gardens. They are quite aggressive and will touch you or follow you. Women will try to shove newborns in your face and ask for money to feed them. They will also try and put items in you hands and refuse to take them back and ask for money instead. Avoid eye contact with them because it just encourages them."
"we were suggested by ChinaSeeing tours to visit this Museum in our Beijing stay, and found this is really amazing architectures and histories"
Had a great time visiting the forbidden city. The historic value is amazing and holds a lot of history. A must see when in China. Great day out.
"If you are black note that you would get alot of stares from the Chinese.

You are also a tourist attraction."
"Wonderful architecture and history, but expected a bit more in the museum. Still worth the trip and is part of an extensive complex of incredible buildings"
"You will need the whole day to explore this site - and that is if you keep moving. It is not possible to see it all in one day, so plan accordingly. I used Beijing Private Forbidden City Walking Tours (Emily) which was the best thing I did. So good. The buildings started to look alike and become very redundant. My guide brought them to life and pointed out the historical and architectural intricacies. Of course, if you really have no interest, you can walk from end to end and say you were there in a much shorter time.
Don't leave out Jingshan Park across from the rear entrance to get the overlook. It is a separate ticket, but it gives you perspective.
There is a restaurant in the museum that offers full meals. I enjoyed mine."
"If in Beijing, take the time to visit- definitely worth seeing- always crowded so keep patience in mind."
"Warning to visitors - there is an area where you need to hand in your handbag/kit bag. Make sure you retrieve it before you move onto the next section as they do not allow you back through the doors to get them back, you have to complete the whole tour and then leave the property and walk all the way around and go back in to get your bags back. Very frustrating.

Overall very beautiful and interesting. Hugh property must allow a couple of hours. Well worth the visit"
"It´s one of the most famous and impressive places in the world. It´s size is unbelievable being aware it was setup just for one person, the emperor of China. To see all halls of harmony it´s a long distance to walk and on a sunny day you´ll look out for the rare shadow places. But it´s worth to complete the 5 halls of harmony."
"I didn't know a huge amount about the forbidden city so was keen to go inside and explore. It is quite spectacular and is quite vast, a lot bigger than I expected. If this is a big interest you might need to allow almost a full day to explore. We had a few hours there and took in a lot but still had more to do."
Been many years since I was last here but it still blows you away. The sheer scale of this place is mind blowing. What a great way to spend some time
"We arrived at about 10.00 a.m., and so did other tour groups. The crowd was scary. There were too many people - and it was difficult to take photographs of anything. Therefore, to enjoy the Palace at is fullest, it would be better to beat those tour groups - 8.30 a.m. or past noon at 12.30 p.m. Also, avoid going to the Palace on Tuesdays. Since it's closed on Monday, a larger crowd is often expected on the next day."
Maybe our impressions are not good because it was hot that day in Beijing. You have to walk straight with limited shade and you are not allowed get in to most of buildings. Most of them you can watch trough dirty glass or small doors. Hovever if you like Chinese history you will be satisfied.
"It is so very large and impressive to see. It is cool to walk around and take in its history. Kind of fun to think of all the movies I have seen as well -- silly side note.

It went through a very large renovation for the Olympics. So, it is still in a very good restored condition overall. Even though, it will be a never ending project.

The gardens are lovely and should not be missed.

Avoid visiting on national holidays. Almost all the tourists are Chinese and it is a must see for all.

There is basically no furniture. All of it was taken to Taiwan, when the royal family fled.

A must see."
"Budget 5 hrs to see whole place at a leisurely pace. We arrived at 12.30 pm and left at closing at 5pm and only missed out the 6 western places and 4 other halls under renovation. Reason we took so long is the sheer number of people in the place. Dress light, bring water and wear comfortable shoes!

It's hilarious that I saw some local girls wearing heels to look great at the entrance and 15 mins in the place they are bare foot walking. :)"
"This place was really cool. I took my time and saw almost every building and I was inside from 8:30-4pm.

I 100% reccomend getting the audio-tour for 40¥ just before entering the actual palace complex. It gives you a GPS type map and gives you information about each building as you arrive.

You can take as long or as little time as you like here, but I'd reccomend arriving early as tickets can (and do) sell out (and it gets pretty hot walking around with the sun beating down on the tiles). The ticket office opens at 8:30am but during peak season (July-August or Spring Festival) people line up before hand.

To get here take line 1 to Tian'anmen East Subway Station and take exit A or B. You will need to wait in line for security and then wait in line for tickets (unless you buy them online) and then you'll have to go through security again before getting inside."
"Huge, colorate and full of story!
This is the forbidden city, too much thing to visit but not enough time in one day unfortunately...
If you prefer a short visit in 2 hours and half it is possible go through the entire forbidden city; but the visit with the audio guide support is requested to better appreciated all of parts of this place, the matter is you will take almost the whole days.
Strongly suggested some comfortable food and a bag for the water."
"We were taken through the Imperial Palace and Emperor's Palace (Palace Museum) by our tour guide. The history and condition of the buildings and life styles of the inhabitants was astounding to learn about and see in person. The Emperor's Palace has the largest grounds and most ornate. The most striking thing for me was that the Emperor's residence was built on the highest foundations and incense was burnt to give the impression of it floating on clouds.
Back I n the day there were some 10,000 people living there, mostly servants, eunuchs, concubines and children of concubines. We couldn't go inside any of the buildings for a better look but there was plenty to look at outside.
Well worth a look considering the long history and residence of some 24 Emperors over time up until the revolution."
It's pretty stunning stuff. I would recommend to visit later in the afternoon to lessen the crowds. We visited about 11am and by the time we were leaving (approximately 2 hours later) the line and people were noticeably less. Most of the tourists walk directly in a straight line through the palace. For sure do this but make sure you stray off the path and check out the east and west. Almost no one is there and you get an entirely different vibe.
"Amazing huge palace, don't miss it if you are in Beijing.

Unfortunately most of indoors are not accessible to public."
"The Forbidden City in Beijing is the largest palace in the world. It has a whopping 9999 rooms & is a real eye opener for me. I just wish I could wander deeper into it to see the vast millions of artifacts preserved. Unfortunately due to vandalism by tourist, these are not opened to public and we could only see the exterior of the buildings. Many places were cornered off and not open to public which is a pity.

Nevertheless, I still think this is definitely a must-see place in Beijing for the splendor and grandeur of an auspicious era that was long past."
"Second time visited this site after more than 12 years and it is still a awesome sight. The moment you enter the meridian gates and gaze at the long courtyard leading to the main receiving palace to the inner living quarters of the emperor and his family, your mouth will literally drop at the grandeur, opulence and size of this palace. The architecture design of the palace is typically Chinese with due emphasise on spiritual energy. The colour and sight of the palace is very eye catching. I have been to Versailles, The Vatican and its Museums, The Hermitage, The Lourve and the Taj Mahal and all of these palace sites pale in comparison in the exterior and interior of the forbidden city. You really need to visit this site to look at its splendour.

The only shortcoming for this palace vis-a-vis the other sites is that there is hardly any furniture or gold opulence as all of these palace treasures were looted by the Nationalists in 1949 and are now in display in the Taipei National Museum.

Do visit the place. Do note that the site has instituted an 80,000 visitor limit a day and you can urchase tickets to enter from their website. As it is in Chinese, since it is meant to attract domestic tourists, it is advisable to book tickets in the morning. Expect it to be crowded, but personally, the crowds are similar to those you see in European and North American museums on summer days. The visitors are generally well behaved and polite despite some westerners complaining about the 'poor' behaviour of the local tourists. I was in Paris Disneyland last year, the European visitors behaviour were a lot worse."
"If you're staying in Beijing, might as well visit the Forbidden City. It is so huge!
Be careful though as there are lots of people visiting the area too!"
"The Forbidden City has many splendid buildings which I only saw a few of in the two hours I was there. I could have spent longer there.

I went with a guide which was great because she explained the history and did all the ticket arrangements. It was very busy as it's popular with Chinese tourists. There were crowds around the Emperor's office and the Empress's quarters.

I would definitely go again to see other parts if I was in Beijing again."
"Every person on the planet should go to China at least once. Life fast forward and perspective in volumes.
The Forbidden City is one of the must-see places in the world. Start on the far end of Tiananmen Square to walk past Mao’s Mausoleum, The Monument of the People and of course Mao’s giant photo hanging on the front of the Forbidden City.
While I wish there was a less touristy section of it (like the Great Wall), it is still an amazing experience. Go early for less people. You can tour many ways – hire a guide, purchase the audio when you arrive, prepare yourself beforehand … Take your passport, water and a snack; you could be there 2 hours or all day.
End with Jingshan Park to look down at the huge scale of the Forbidden City. The scale of it all is mind boggling and a good reminder to the scale of China in general."
I had to try to fit this in with the Summer Palace and Tiannamen Square. Part of the City was closed for renovations so we couldn't see it all. Lots of walking but not much climbing.
"There is a lot to see and explore here at the Forbidden city. I would make sure that you have a guide so that you can learn about all the details and secrets of this place. But you will need to be prepared to walk, this palace isn't short by any stretch of the imagination."
I wasn't overly impressed with it but there were some pretty areas. They updated the paint and things in certain areas and I much preferred the original and subdued tones in the old paint. We needed more time there but it was so busy it was hard to really see too much.
"Interesting yet I was expected more from a museum the is carrying the name - the palace museum. Nice to visit, not a must"
The forbidden city is nice but not as magnificient as it seems. I did not really enjoy it because there wasn't anyhing special about it compared to other temples in Beijing. I only went because its part of the experience in China.
It is over a hundred hectares of land. The size of the gate post is enough to awe you. You have to past a few gates and walls before you come to the palace. Unfortunately you cannot walk inside the palace. Nevertheless the footprint of the area is awestruck.
"The entire ""city"" is amazing, I'm so amazed by all the history China's got, and I'm also very jealous of it haha. I'm glad I watched The Last Emperor before coming here as it made me appreciate it a smidge more, I could also tell my friend a bit about the history which was nice.
It's huge though, which is something to keep in mind, if you're easily tired this might not be a place for you to visit. My friend and I were absolutely exhausted after the visit and we're both athletes. It's also very hot and not that windy, not that you can blame that on the Palace."
Is a Must opulent and Huge. We are not used to visit a place with EMPTY buildings that generated me a little discomfort. But is very impressive it is real a inner whole city
"Very large, very old palace complex. Very crowded with tourists to allow lots of time and be prepared to walk a lot (and slowly).

Get the audio guide as it tells the story of every building you walk near.

The Imperial Garden at the back has amazing trees and artificial rock formations."
This place is huge. With long ornate staircases which the emperors would get carried up (you'll see the staircases either side and the middle not as worn in). Across the road from Tiananmen Square you will have to spend at least 1 hour here even if you walk fast. Ask your tour guide about the assassination attempt on one of the emperors and how he would have many beds and sleep in s different one every night. Words do not do this place justice so get down and see it for yourself. The old fashioned fire extinguisher pots you'll see around were kept alight at winter so that the water didn't freeze! Genius !
"The Great Wall, Forbidden City and Tiananmen Square are must visits in Beijing. I would suggest trying to soak in as much as possible of this vast Chinese palace compound with spectacular architecture and extensive history."
With thousands of years preserved in one beautiful place I highly recommend visiting this Landmark. You will be amazed!
"The place may be small, but it is packed with treasures from the Forbidden city - from fans to Chinese caps fit for royalty! The wooden figures are so lovely!"
"I originally gave this 3 stars, but thinking back, my opinion might have been impacted due to the heat of the day with no shade here. At the end of the day.. how can you miss it if you are there... but it's stark with no trees. You can't get to the majority of it (not that you'd need to see servants quarters for a mile.. but still). The buildings you can walk up to you still can't enter.

ALSO -- this gives CROWDED a whole new meaning. As in jamming about 8 people into a bathroom stall... no joke. Most of that was in line and getting through security.. but it was ridiculous. The tour guide said it was like that all the time, every day. That is NUTS! My 7 year old fell down.. and even though he was holding my hand, I couldn't see him. Luckily I can be pushy when needed and pulled out the ""mom"" voice and people made enough room for him to stand up.
Once you get though the gate, it eases up.
It was interesting to see once, but if you had to pick between say this and the Summer Palace.. I'd choose the Summer Palace 100 times over"
Great place to visit 5 stars ***** from us. Great Value for money. Do visit this place. Best visit via a tour arrangement with English speaking guide. Take a lot of pictures. I definitely visit this place again.
"It's incredible-I knew it was large, but the size truly can take your breath away. We had a guide, Rico, who was fantastic about sharing information and culture, and who was essential for us to have even the slightest clue of where we were.

There are signs at most significant locations in English, so even without a guide, you can have a decent idea of what you're seeing. There aren't many maps, though, so my advice is to take a picture of one with your phone so you can have a better chance of navigating.

Also, it's way too big to see all in one day, so if you're only spending a day there, I'd advise to do some research and pick a few things that you particularly want to see. I really enjoyed seeing the clock museum and the theater.

If you want more information on the context and culture, I do highly recommend having a guide. Rico really added a lot to our experience, so we knew who used these things and why, what role these facilities played in Chinese culture, etc. He was also fantastic at navigating the bureaucracy for us, because there are numerous ticket counters that you'll have to go through.

Last thought-with all the stone floors and little shade, it gets hot here quickly. Bring water and sunscreen. There are a few places that sell water or other drinks, but they're cash only. Also, the earlier in the day you go, the fewer people you have to deal with and the less sun too."
"Go early as the crowds from the coaches arrive early & you will end up in big queues. We hired the audio hand sets & they wasn't that good as the narrator didn't match the building & husbands stopped altogether?? Don't forget your cameras as plenty of beautiful buildings. There can be a lot of walking, but there are seats at various points for you to sit on.
Well worth going."
The forbidden city is quite expansive. Until you enter do you actually realise how big the place is. Quite majestic. It takes a long time to walk around and there is options for wheelchairs if it gets to much for the seniors. By taking the trip with a tour it is easier and you get audio sets to listen to. There are security points to go through like most things Chinese and be aware the site surrounding it is monitored. It does takes a substantial time to get around so allow for a few hours.
"The day we went was crowded, probably normal for this type of location- but our tour guide CActus did care of the trip wonderfully"
I have made a very long walk tour inside the Forbidden City and I could see a very good example of The ancient Chinese architecture. Most beautiful were the wooden roofs inside the palaces. It is easy to spot some just married couples having a photo shooting using their typical dresses.
"Passport required ,security is tight and the queue is long when on your own our first visit -when on a Tour things become so much easier. We made two visits to the Forbidden City while in Beijing as there is just so much to see & take in.Both times I found the place austere&you have to let your imagination fly to see it as the Emperor would have seen his palaces with all the colourful costumes & pageantry .Still a fascinating place because of the enclosed Imperial court & the ritual of power -combine the buildings with your imagination & then it works.
It takes stamina as there is very little shade ( take water ) & it is crowded with predominantly Chinese tourists who have very sharp elbows when they want to see something - no buildings are open for entry & certain buildings attract the crowds -I gave up trying to see or photo the throne room through the window. Plenty of less important but no less attractive buildings do not attract the hordes & give you excellent photo opportunities. The Emperors garden towards the North exit is a quiet oasis & worth looking for."
"This was our first taste of sightseeing in China. And what a start. The forbidden city is beautiful. We went as a small tour group, and I think it I worthwhile having a guide to tell you some background information to give you a better understanding of what you are experiencing. There is little shade and on a hot day is very hot. Hats and water are a must. It is a huge place, and takes at least a couple of hours to walk through. But a must visit."
We expected to visit the Forbidden City but did not realize how large of a complex it actually is. It took us the better part of 4 hours and we could have stayed longer. We rented the voice recordings at the booth in the beginning which really enhanced our experience so we learned about the different buildings and the different Emperors. There was even stories and legends outlined in the recordings such as the scandal involving the Emperor choosing his successor. The gardens on the backside are beautiful and worth spending some time at. It was a nice time and well worth the trip
"This world-famous monument to royalty and distinctive design is a must-see because it is an icon of Asia. It is huge, as widely reported, and not exactly designed for common visitors. The admit price is low (34 RMB or US$5), and it includes a primitive English (and other) foreign language audio recorder. The buildings are perfect for trip photos - everyone is taking post-card and gag photos. You will walk 4-5 miles unless you cut short the typical path. Beware the climate - in late-May it was relentlessly hot and humid, with no relief from the sun. Water, sunglasses, a hat highly recommended. Note that paid tours are not necessary, but signage is limited and individuals may find themselves in long security lines. One temporary exhibit, featuring 17-19th century diplomatic exchange gifts, was air-conditioned and a modern museum. In summary, do not miss it but come prepared."
"The history, the stories, the architecture, are all amazing. Our guide gave suggestions for things to be pushy to see ;-) and things to skip (one throne vs another). Unless it means something to you, you don't have to go through center gates with the hoards of people, go to a side and move through a little quicker so you can linger where you want. Read up before you go, but you will still enjoy even if you don't read. Going to China is likely your trip of a lifetime, but remember, it is likely the trip of a lifetime for the Chinese tourists too, and it means something to them, so be patient."
Fascinating visit to this old city across thc road from tienamen square. Uneven surface to watch out for. Need a guide to explain and show all the highlights. Some shops availble for snacks and refreshments. Lots of people visiting.
"Went on a Monday and was really crowded. No crowd at the ticketing counter but it was packed with people inside the palace. We wanted to have a guide with us instead of the interactive guide but realised that all the guides spoke Chinese only. We eventually rented the interactive guide for 40RMB each. It was easy to operate and carry around. The interactive guide was informative and gave us a better understanding of the history behind the palace. The infrastructure was impressive. It was difficult to take a shot without being photobombed but it was good enough to be able to be present to appreciate the palace. We spent about two hours there. Given better weather conditions, we would have covered more area!"
"Huge place which takes some time to take in. Recommended to also include the treasury part, as it is i) a lot less crowded, and ii) very interesting through its major draws such as the 9 dragon screen.

Had a group of VIPs come through halfway in our visit; this means the main route is fully closed and you're forced to slowly follow behind the VIPs as section by section is opened in their wake."
You need comfy shoes and water as this is a very big area to visit so lots of walking. Our guide walked us through the City and it was good to have her explain the history of the site as there is no English signs to relate to what you see. Another historical site that you should visit when in Beijing.
"Iv'e seen Kung Fu Panda and other movies and I knew this place would be big...but I had no idea it was going to be that big!

We had 4hrs here...I think you could easily spend 2 days here and not get bored. There was always something wherever you turned...and make sure you keep looking up when you get to one of the buildings...they are amazing.

I could have done without the ""Beetles-style"" mob crush at the Emperors throne room...watch out for the old ladies they have sharp elbows and know how to use them to get in front of you! In the end it was worth the bruised ribs to see.

Enjoyed this place immensely. Couldn't help and close my eyes and try to drift back into time...this place would have been amazing (although impossible) to behold in its prime."
"This is the must see location in Beijing, and its size and scope won't disappoint. We had a tour guide, but there are audio tours available as well. A lot of walking. As mentioned, you can't go inside most of the rooms, but the main point is to get an idea of the scale of the place."
"Palace musem, heritage buildings, park. Be prepared to walk almost most of the day. Adult 34 RMB peak season. Must carry passport. Floods of people."
One of the most impressive sights we visited while in China. It's a massive place so expect to spend the whole day there. Take plenty of water with you if it is a hot day. They do sell water inside the Forbidden city but it's not always refrigerated. Loved the Hall of Literary Brilliance with the pottery museum. All the buildings are very impressive. The kids enjoyed it too. Expect some delays in getting on Weekends and bank holidays as the sight attracts a lot of domestic tourism too and there are various security procedures before getting in.
"Very interesting, but also very crowded. Very big area so bring good shoes for walking. Umbrella against the sun is a good tip."
"If you're staying somewhere local, then you can catch the train and disembark at Tiananmen Square East station. Go early to beat the long queues and crowds. You will need your passport to hire the audio guide headset. No need to pay extra for a private tour guide, the audio guide headset covers enough. It's available in every language. Expect to do a lot of walking. So take comfortable shoes and sun protection. Allow at least 3 hours."
"WOW..it goes on and on.... despite fantastic tour guide, difficult to garner a good understanding of the entirety of the place- pamphlets or written info would have been very useful. Absolutely amazing... kids really impressed but bored by half way.... sooooo many people!!"
"Seeing the Forbidden Palace was the realisation of a childhood dream! It lived up to my years of fantasising with its' many fascinating buildings, the history recitations of our guide, and the many varied little entrances, courtyards, intricate doorways and roof decoration. The magic was palpable!"
A great place to visit but most rooms didn't open to public to have a closer view. After the visit I just remember the buildings and didn't feel the history of it.
The place is probably the spot with most historical significance after the great Wall. The emperor were afraid of intruders jumping down from trees so he kept his offices and abode areas free of trees
"Times have certainly changed since my first visit in 1997. Across Tiananmen Square is the Forbidden City, one of the most amazing landmarks that date back to the Imperial rule, when the emperor and royal family governed and reigned over the entire kingdom. Hence, the crowds assemble in thousands to see this marvel of engineering, so rich in history, stunning architecture, with attention to intricate symmetry which leaves one spellbound.
The numerous rooms, chambers, and halls look very tired and are in desperate need or conservation and restoration. The thousands of visitors who trek to this site every day would also pose a problem, as well as the pollution, haze, humidity and constant rain. Despite all this, one can sit back and soak in the sights and history of this marvelous complex.
This is undeniable, the jewel in the crown, one of China’s great masterpiece. Prior to my visit, I had the opportunity to view The Last Emperor, and it presented an insight of the splendor and grandeur of this Forbidden City, that is drenched in history. The magnificent halls, winding lanes, and stately courtyards await the eager tourist. Stretching over 180 acres, it is a massive complex. As I gazed at the roof of glazed yellow tiles, which is a symbol of royalty, and tried to imagine a time when only the emperor was permitted to enter the palace, accompanied by select family members, concubines, and eunuchs used as servants.
Be prepared to be shoved and pushed to view all those rooms and chambers. A professional guide is a must since this is a huge, complicated complex. Assemble at the entrance as early as possible, with water to replenish. Don’t forget to carry your passport, good walking shoes, and more water."
"Such an amazing place to visit, full of both recent and ancient history. Expect long queues for security and squat only public toilets."
"More than 800 buildings, a huge square (claim it could hold 100k people). Will take 3 to 4 hours to go through it. We took over 150 pictures, none do it justice. If you're looking for a good western toilet it's to your right as you enter the main square. Not a place to eat or drink, bring some water!"
"We were fortunate to have a beautiful day to tour the Forbidden City. It is mostly outdoors and there is little shade. There is a lot of walking and stairs - although you can move at your own pace so it can be manageable. The headphone equipment to listen to information about the site is a must. It works as you approach the area and gives excellent information about what you are looking at. Do not try to do the tour without these or a guide - you will miss all the history and it will not be a meaningful visit. Most buildings are closed off and you have to peer in from a doorway which can get crowded. I suggest going first thing in the morning when it opens - there are less crowds. The courtyards are wide open allowing for ease of walking between temples and buildings. The garden at the end is beautiful and a lovely respite from the sun and stone. I recommend spending some time in the garden to enjoy and reflect. There is a lot of area to cover - if you try to cram in too much, I believe it may lose its appeal. Pick a straight route and enjoy a smaller area rather than try and squeeze in every corner of the Forbidden City. The history is truly amazing - the one thing I would say is that it looked ""freshly painted"" which takes away from the historical nature of the buildings - it felt like a makeover rather than a renovation - still amazing though."
"The scale of the forbidden city is incredible, although I thought it was lacking somewhat in terms of information about the history, even though we hired the audio guide.
Definitely worth a visit though."
This is a vast area with a multitude of decorated wooden buildings. It is interesting to imagine how individuals lived here. There were so many rules where one could not go and how they had to behave. The building's roofs are decorated with various animals symbolizing the status of the inhabitants. They are decorated with bright paintings. The negatives are a lot of walking needs done and one needs to fight crowds and stand in lines to see the sights
"The Forbidden City is without doubt one of the true wonders of the world, but if you want to enjoy it ... give it some time.
Firstly - get there for opening and include time for tickets and getting a guide ... say 8:30am. Fork out the money for a personal guide ... and pay the extra 50 Yuan per hour to keep them until you run out of steam.
Be prepared for both the numbers of people and the heat (on a sunny day you will boil - but there are loads of drink points around the City). If you want great photos - you will have to take the opportunities ... as everyone wants to get the shots too !
Whilst the big ticket sights within the forbidden city are a must to see ... and for your guide to explain, this place is HUGE (with just under 1,000 rooms) you need to make sure you keep the pace up to cover all that you will want to (it is easy to spend hours and get to see little).
Make sure you spend the extra (little) cost of getting to see the more hidden ""jewels"" within the Palace (example - where the Emperors mother lived and the area around the well where she murdered her sons favourite love).
When you have hopefully ticked off the main sights ... reward yourself with some relaxation / quiet time, away from the crowds in the smaller courtyards / gardens ... such as those around the well area or the smaller museums."
"We liked the Forbidden City, I would say it was the highlight of our trip but it is worth a visit. Nice temples, Loved the bridges, sculptures, etc. It is a very big site that takes at least half a day to visit. The part we like the most was the garden at the end.
TAKE YOUR PASSPORT WITH YOU. They don't sell you the tickets if you don't have your passport."
Incredible! Words can not do it justice. Wear comfortable shoes. Lots of walking and up and down stairs. Helpful to have a tour guide.
"What a marvel, the history however is the fascinating thing about this place. Must take a guide or you are just wondering lost in its marvel not understanding the important little things like how many and what type of figures on the roof eaves establish what class of person can live in the building."
This is a huge place and a great place to walk around. Plan on spending at least 2 or three hours here to be able to enjoy it all.
"Lots of walking in this immense space. Lavish carvings and golden thrones, but not easily taken in or absorbed when I was tired from walking."
"This was the Chinese imperial palace from the Ming to end of Qing dynasty (roughly 1420 to 1912). It’s in the centre of Beijing and is now the Palace Museum. It’s right in the city centre, to the north of Tiananmen Square. It’s a massive complex covering 74 hectares and there are more than 8,700 rooms. It’s surrounded by a wide moat and a 10m high wall. It’s divided into two parts - the Outer Court where the emperor and his ministers would have carried out their business and the Inner Court where the emperor, royal family and concubines lived. Well worth a visit but allow a good amount of time to wander around this huge complex."
"The most amazing location, so much to see and do & experience. gets busy, so take some patience. The garden is amazing at the end."
"Huge place, took our breath away with the size.
Quite funny how it just keeps going, our favourite part was the garden at the end."
"This truely is an amazing place so much to see and do. Walk through the different sections and let your breath be taken away. This is an attraction that you can spend hours at. There are lots of people here but due to it's size it at times seems empty. There are area for sitting and relaxing in and toilets. The emperors garden is amazing. For those 80's kids you will recognise this as the area featured in Monkey Magic.
You will require a reasonable level of fitness as it can get hot and the walking is about 2-3 km. For those who need assistance wheelchairs are available with a pusher for about $60"
"The attraction is massive. There is a great deal of walking involved, a lot of amazing architecture to take in and even more history to absorb. It is truly remarkable to think about all that is there now and that it has been there for so long. The design is so well thought out and so 'practical'. It's possible to buy food there at a reasonable cost and admission fee was quite fair. There is definitely more to this site than appears on the outside."
"We went to the Forbidden City on a day when the temperature was 100 degrees Fahrenheit. It was HOT!!! the Forbidden City is beautiful but overwhelming. We couldn't stop taking photos of all the beautiful architecture and thrones. Because of the heat, and poor choice of shoes (sandals and walking shoes instead of tennis shoes or hiking shoes), we were exhausted at the end of or visit. Take lots of water and wear very comfortable tennis shoes."
You can't miss this wonderful place! Crowded but very manageable. I arranged a guided tour and it was much better than the audio guide!
"We spent most of the day here and still didn't see it all - a beautifully preserved historical site built entirely with no nails. Lots of interesting artefacts, most with both an English and Chinese translation. Close to Tian'anmen Square so both can be done in one day"
Absolutely huge. Wear comfy shoes as there's lots of walking. The squares are huge and loads of temples but nothing inside them to see. Once we had seen the first half a dozen we weren't as enthusiastic as.they were all much the same. There was a dignitary visit the day we were there so were unable to see the Emperor's sleeping quarters unless.we were prepared to stand.in the blazing heat in one of the unshaded squares for at least an hour.... we chose to go on through the rest of the city. Size-wise it is immense but as.previously mentioned most buildings blend into one as they are so similar.
"Forbidden City has always been in my bucket list to visit. I finally got the chance to visit this remarkable historical landmark last year in November.

I was awed by this landmark, on how such mega structure was built in the time where the technology was not as advanced as the modern day. It is both meticulous and beautiful at the same time.

This landmark is very well preserved. The area is very clean. You might experience a long queue and strict security check (for foreigner, please bring along your passport) when you are about to go inside the area, but it is totally worth it.

There is electronic tour guide available in your choice of language. It explains area by area as it reads your position in the area through GPS. Very convenient.

Definitely a place to go visit when you are in Beijing."
"I went on a tour booked through my hotel and was not disappointed.
You really have to see the scale of this place to believe it.
It just goes on and on.
Great going with a tour group to get the history."
"This palace compound has over 600years of history dating as far back to the times of Kublai Khan of the Yuan Dynasty. The emperor who masterminded the building of this city was the very emperor who initiated the Great Treasure Fleet of Imperial China in the early 15th century - 3rd Emperor of the Ming Dynasty, Emperor Yong Le( Eternal Happiness ) aka Zhu Di.

The last time when I visited the Forbidden City, it was exactly 24years ago back in Jun 1993!China had just opened up officially to the world back then and it has indeed come a long way. I have always loved the Forbidden City ever since my first visit here back then and over the years, I'm pleased to know that the local authorities have been working to upgrade and protect this very ancient palace compound which is a pride of us Chinese and the Chinese civilization!
However one point of dismay during our most recent trip is the weather! There was severe showers on the first stage of our visit to Tianamen Square and entrance to the Forbidden City which affected our moods a little, but fortunately the rain stopped when we were half way through our tour of the Forbidden City!

Having visited the Italian attractions of Venice and the ruins of Pompeii( near Naples) a month earlier, I would put the crowd level at the Forbidden City the same if not more crowded than those that I experienced in Italy. Unlike Italy, the visitors here comprised usually of not only foreigners but also a fraction of the total Chinese population globally( part of the local population of 1.2billion + the large number of unknown population of overseas Chinese ) adding to that foreigners from the rest of the world. Probably the fact that the weather was wet on the day we went, the crowd was not that huge!

In all, there are between 800-1,000 rooms in the Forbidden City. For those in a hurry, priority will be walking through the center of the Forbidden City from Tiananmen Gate through Meridien Gate and ending at Shenwu Gate.

Grandest point of all will at at the Taihedian( 太和殿). As this is where the Emperor meets all ministers and mandarins in the mornings.

In all, this is a must visit for anyone who comes to Beijing!"
"Forbidden city is a huge place and cost 60RMB to enter after the initial courtyard. You only buy a ticket once you pass the second gate otherwise you can't go further.

The biggest issue is the security checks, by 9am security queues swelter and in the heat in summer time is a tough task. They are scanning backpacks so if you have one you are in the slow queue. As you approach the security checks you may be stopped for an ID check. If you're a foreigner, use English and move along just like the storm troopers let Obi Wan move along. They're checking for internal security threats.

It appears that if you take the train to the Tianneman square east station, you can by pass large snaking queues. So consider taking the train.

Bring your passport as you need it to buy a ticket and move inside, You can buy drinks and ice cream inside. It would take 3 hours over to work through it properly and then You need to exit. So think carefully if you have kids that need to eat. Pineapple ice cream at 7RMB is just nice.

Once You move past the first 4 gates it gets repetitive so you need to decide on whether you want to continue. We exited near the east wall to find some restaurants and streets with all sorts of things being sold. It's a tourist area and whilst not like a Taiwan night market, I could spend a good 40 mins walking back to the Grand Hyatt hotel I stayed at."
"Beautiful ""city"" - I would recommend having a guide of some sort - this was the second time I've visited and I learned so much more the second time with a good guide. It was kind of busy but not so much that we couldn't see everything. It's definitely an iconic stop in Beijing!"
"Visited the Forbidden City with my family today @ Beijing - our first ever visit to the country.

The scale & legacy of the city spoke for itself. After crossing the multiple gates, it felt that the architecture was similar but the grandeur is non-comparable.

What is fabulous is that for centuries the Chinese people or its royalties have believed in scale which is reflected in today's grand scale of modern china as well."
"If you go to China, you must see this. Steeped in history and a beautiful place. I would recommend a guided tour as you get more insight into the complex"
"I can't image how they could build such a grand palace hundreds years ago, it's so huge, the design is so incredible, I can tell even the best designer in nowadays can't make such an amazing project. Just remind that, it's so hot to visit in sunshine days in summer as most of the activities are outdoors, so I think in spring or early autumn maybe better."
"Visited the Forbidden City for the second time and loved it even more! It is an amazing structure, fabulous and magical at the same time. It has so many inner courts into it that it takes half a day to see them all. Unfortunately most of the personal items of the Emperors are in the museums, but still gives you a good impression of how it was till 1911. The whole layout speaks of mathematical and architectural symmetry and harmony (at least that's what i felt without being a pro this). Can be a challenge though if you are not used to walk a lot, there are lots of stairs to be climbed. Loved it and will visit again!!"
"if you ignore the hordes of visitors to the Forbidden city you can get a small idea of what life was like in Imperial China - well for the Emperor at least. this is a vast complex, but its a vast complex of wooden houses/palaces - you are not permitted to enter the wooden structures - well other than the one selling the usual tacky tourist ""souvenirs"" for fear you may set them alight so you get a very limited view of the inside which for me is the more important. if you don't like crowds or don't know how to push and shove back then this is not for you. if you do go make sure you see the clock exhibition and the dragon wall plaque - both of which the tour company I booked with missed off the tour and I had to make a complaint to get to see them - the clocks are amazing (although a lesson in glass cleaning and display maintenance wouldn't go amiss)"
"You can't go to Beijing without going to the Forbidden City.
Last time we were there in the 80's it was pretty deserted- so huge it takes a lot of visitors! Now, it is full to bursting with people- mainly Chinese new-middle class tourists! They are there to goggle at the excesses of their ancestors- can't blame them for that, but they are in big mobs, moving from pavilion to pavilion. Makes it hard to get close to anything, but it's their country I suppose.
Most surprising thing is that the government have made little effort to make it a better visitor experience in 30 years. Looks in the same sort of stae with the same slightly grubby look to all the rooms."
This area is very busy with Chinese as well as visitors but you have to visit this place. Its amazing and you can just imagine the emperors living and walking around the area. One gate house leads into another until you get to the centre of the complex. Old Chinese buildings and history abounds and if like us you have a guide to point out the finor points then you can really appreciate the area so much more. From the old iron couldrons for fire fighting to the servants and concubine quarters. History just surrounds you. Wear comfy shoes as you walk miles from front to back but well worth it.
"The forbidden city is a huge city within a city. Beijing's centre or how they call it the first ring is the Forbidden City. Choose a good time to visit it because there are NO trees or gardens inside.
There is hardly any shade and the wind was almost non-existant while we visited this location in the beginning of May. Temperature was showing 35 degrees Celsius. Add to that the pollution and it becomes a bit uncomfortable with the humidity factor.
Thre are a lot of tourists inside but it moves well.

CAUTION: Once you enter the Forbidden City, you will have to do the entire grounds as you can not go back where you entered. You need to get out at the exit so be prepared to walk on uneven stones and floors. Wear comfortable shoes, and bring water. They do have locations where you can buy a good bottle of water nice and cold.
It is a must while in Beijing."
"is just a special place, you might want to read something about the place before going there to enjoy more the tours there, is really cold in winter inside, you can enter with your camera there are not really annoying security check ups. just standard."
"Visited the Forbidden City as part of our tour of China. Very busy with lots of sightseers. It was quite impressive going through 3 enormous red gates to reach the Palace.

Perhaps a visit in off peak times would be beneficial."
Lots of history we visited with friends but would recommend a guided tour to get the whole history and stories told by a professional like a Catherine Lu tours or similar
"Possibly after the Great Wall , this is the most important attraction in China . It tells you a lot about the history and culture of China .A quick visit will require at least 2 - 3 hours . A detailed visit will demand a full day . The main parts are generally very crowded . Its visit involves considerable walking . But it is once in a lifetime opportunity . So it cannot be missed ."
"fantastic. a huge place, wear good shoes. we went with a tour guide so again we fast tracked. awe inspiring place with information readily available. an excellent visit"
"Whilst this is a beautiful place to visit and wander through all the areas, it is very open and tiring on a hot day."
"I had no idea of the scale of the forbidden city and did not imagine it would be more than another parlance on a foreign trip. I was so wrong. The scale, grandeur and artistry of the place was awe inspiring.

Get a translator to make the most of the visit. I will return when I have more time..."
The Forbidden City is HUGE. Do go with a guide or you may miss out on many hidden historic details. My advice is to go in cooler months. We went in May and it was very hot and humid. Not many shade places for relief from the heat. Cold water was for sale.
Visited Forbidden City a multiple times before. This is a must see attraction in Beijing but weekends are extremely busy and there are long lines. You need comfortable shoes and good camera. I love this place.
So enjoyed our visit to the Forbidden City - so much history our local guide Rene kept us well informed. We had plenty time to explore on our own once we had had he potted history from our guide. Beautiful buildings so very well preserved
It takes 3 hours to to walk the grounds but its well worth it. In ancient China it was the center of the universe ans outsiders were forbidden under penalty of death!
"Part of an SNA tour that first visited Tienanmen Square. The grounds and sections of the palace tell a tale of power and intrigue. Great photo opportunities, a place that sold water and icecreams about halfway through and also the opportunity to dress up in dynastic gear for a photo. There are displays of wealth and fine jade, some very old trees with fabulous knotted trunks, a souvenir shop and grand garden space with interesting large rocks. A splendid place needing time and energy to explore."
"Entered from Tienanmen square and walked north from there. The detailing of the roofs, cielings and grounds are amazing. You may also get to feel what celebrity feels like in line as school kids will happily stare at you :0). Wave to them and say ""knee how"". A quick tour will take 1.5 hours. You could easily spend a full day there.

They need to offer tickets to shoot a forbidden jumper."
"Classic China! The Forbidden City (so called because it was out of bounds for the common man earlier) is a complex which gives you a taste of the size, culture and history of the country!"
"We booked a tour guide through viator (online) and he was fantastic. This is a must see part of Beijing. Take passports for security checks and a guide is the best option of you like to learn about the history etc. Can't speak highly enough of the Forbidden City tour. You can book tours through hotels, remember its very difficult to book yourselves online in China due to the internet restrictions. There are ways around it but difficult."
This site is an absolute must see when visiting Beijing. It has so much history and meaning for the Chinese people. You cannot walk within this site without stepping back in time and being humbled by the fact it is so old and has so much history to tell. The important people and lesser people who have forged this site to be what it is today puts you in absolute awe that people such as Chinese Emperors and The Dragon Lady walked the cobbled stone grounds and buildings you are touching and seeing.
"Although the area is very beautiful, and the cultural story is impressive, we were a bit disappointed that we could not go inside any palaces and it was difficult to look inside th he buildings. There is room to improve. Nice to have been there."
"The Forbidden City is a must see for visiting Beijing. But it is very massive and many of the buildings start to look the same. I would not take a guided tour, they may spend way too long there."
"Yes. Go there. Amazing palaces are mostly empty, squares and terraces are impressing, number of thematic exhibitions. No, no need to see everything, Except main entrance fee you will be asked to buy another tickets for some parts of the museum. After seeing twentieth kind of same building, excursion becomes boring. It´s time to leave. Souvenirs are overpriced. Eat outside."
"We visited the Forbidden City, home to 24 Chinese emperors from 500 years of dynastic rule, as part of a tour group, which meant that we were bound by our guide’s itinerary and the pace of our group, missing out on so many of the nooks and crannies we could have explored and the information our guide shared was mostly limited to the actual construction and very little about the interesting history.

For instance, back in the day, commoners were not allowed to see the emperor and were killed when they did – even when the emperor went outside the gates. To warn people that the emperor was leaving the palace, the guards would sound bells it he turned left, drums if he turned right and both if he went straight. I know this interesting fact because I read up on the history and it wasn’t even mentioned by our guide.

The Forbidden city is HUGE and it is very crowded in the sense that we could not get near any of the buildings to view the inside (we’d probably have had a better chance if we weren’t part of a large group all trying to get through). The open squares are quite spacious and there is plenty of room for movement, photographs (with and without people in it) and people watching!

On the day we were there, it was an exceptionally hot and sunny day and there is no shade unless you can manage to find a spot under one of the structures. Take a hat, sunscreen and plenty of water! There are a few kiosks selling water, soft drinks, ice cream and souvenirs, but they’re quite far apart. There is a LOT of walking! Wear very comfortable shoes! It took our group 3 hours just to get through it from entry to exit and we literally just walked through it without deviating from the main middle section. If you do the Forbidden City directly after Tiananmen Square (which would make sense as they’re right next to each other) you’ll probably have about 5 hours of walking in one go.

We were fortunate to witness the change of the guard while we were there – the guards must be exactly the same length and shoulder width to be perfectly uniform when marching (another interesting fact our guide never shared).

I’d recommend either hiring a knowledgeable private guide or to do your own research before the time and do your own thing. The Forbidden City is definitely a must do! It is unbelievably impressive!"
"If you're into Oriental History or just wanting to know more about the cultures and traditions and history of China and their Royal families, this is a must see place."
This was another great historical visit. Remember to bring your passports to get through security. We didnt stay too long as it was quite crowded.
"It's a long walk throughout but completely worth it! Lots of beautiful architecture with rich history. It can be crowded and it only has ""eastern style"" potties in some spots with one ""western"" stall if available at all. Bring water...it gets hot and there's not much shade!"
"This place is too crowded with unruly tourists trying to see the throne. You must find a time to visit this palace after the bus loads of tourists left. If I were to visit this place again, I will go there early in the morning to grab a ticket. Spend time visiting all the smaller, non-significant parts of this palace. By noon or lunch hour, only proceed to see the main halls."
"Beautiful palace and it is well preserved. The palace is so huge, please be prepared to spend a few good hours and might not even be enough to cover the whole place. Get there early to avoid the crowd."
"We meant to get there by 8:30am, but we were a bit late and arrived half an hour later. By then, other visitors had also arrived. We were surrounded by a huge crowd of visitors, who were mostly Chinese.
All the buildings in Forbidden City have yellow-glazed tiles. As yellow was considered the noblest colour, it was used only for the emperors. I told my guide that the roof tiles of other places in Beijing didn’t look nice with grey colours, but that my house in Adelaide was black and beautiful. Then, she said that Chinese people don’t like black roof as the colour black represents water (i.e., leaking roof)!"
This place is huge! You need at least 3-4 hours to see everything. We were there on a Sunday so it was extremely crowded. But well worth it!
If you're in Beijing you need to carve-out time for the Forbidden City. Plan for MASSIVE crowds. If you have children - consider how you're going to get around with a push-chair (it isn't easy) but it is worth it.
It is my second time that I am here. I think it's boring for the second visit. I suggest going without elderly people because they should take a walk around 2 miles.
"The sheer magnitude of the Forbidden City is breathtaking. For maximum benefit it is worth having a guide to explain the significance of many aspects of the city and its history. While some areas have been renovated, others are more in their original state. Not all areas were open when I visited (a public holiday) but it provided me with new perspectives and understandings of the Chinese dynasties and their power."
"Make sure to visit with someone who's very familiar with the history. I had a fantastic time and lucky enough to have the best tour guide, but happened to overhear the inaccurate information given to some other tourists through a very broken English by other tour guides."
A fabulous collection of buildings and artefacts. It makes you want to understand quite what went on within those walls.
Very busy as we were visiting on Dragonboat holiday but this extraordinary place can cope with a massive number of visitors and still be a great experience and an awe-inspiring introduction to Imperial China. We had a guided tour - which I thoroughly recommend. Lucy really knew her stuff and had loads of stories to enliven each part of our journey through the Forbidden City. One of the wonders of the world and a must see for any visitor to this wonderful and friendly city.
"The Forbidden city is a must to see for tourists in China. You can understand more about the mentality of Chinese emperors, officials, servants, concubines and soldiers. The happy but unhappy place will unfold its secrets and history for you."
"Try to go early morning..tickets sales start at 8.30, but there are lines already 1 hr before. Also could be very slow going through security if going late. Make sure take passport for buying tickets.
Read about it before you go..too much to know about it."
Totally amazing and a must see for all visitors to China if you are interested in history and culture. This place goes on and on and gives on giving. Sadly we were on an action packed trip and only had limited time in the City but it was truly amazing and recommended. Also there is a coffee shop! With really good coffee and delightful people serving! Comes in a take away cup as well. Don't miss a visit to this place and leave a good three hours. There is little shelter from the sun and there are many people.
"Suggest you first read about the Forbidden city and its history before you visit there. Put on your walking shoes and be prepared to devote at least 2 to 3 hours as you will have to walk long distances between several palaces, each of which is separated by Gates. . It was sunny when we visited in May, and very crowded with tourists.
The Tianmen square is in front of the main entry to the Palaces , while the exit gate is at least a kilometer away on the back side. A guide would be very useful to understand the significance of each palace and aretfact."
"We arrived here early, when it opened in the morning to avoid crowds - not possible, there is one huge Chinese tour group after another, going in - rather like a continual mob flowing through the gates. Behaviour of these groups was not great - not only shoving & pushing but physically pulling you out of their way so that they could get in front. I actually got scared at one point & deciding that nothing was that much worth seeing to go through that, so we went off to the sides where there were far fewer people, to view the buildings from further away, rather than joining the mob. This was a good strategy, as you can't go inside most of the main buildings anyway, only peer through doors/windows & can't see much as it's very dark inside (so why all the fighting to do this??!) The Nine Dragon Screen was worth seeing but a bit difficult to find even with a map - you have to pay a little extra for this, but not much. You need to spend at least 2 hours in the FC - it's a big area to cover. They sell water on stalls in various places. You'll need your passports to show security on entrance & there is a discount for seniors (can't remember if it was over 60 or over 65!) Worth going to, but very tiring. Apart from seeing Tiananmen Square (do this first, before the FC) , then you can walk through the FC and out the other end......don't plan on doing any more 'heavy duty sight-seeing' for rest of that day!"
"I wasn't overly impressed with this place. We decided to walk around on our own and did not take a guide, perhaps that was the mistake. The place is quite big, and it was quite hot on the day of our visit, so we got bored, tired of the heat and crowds pretty soon. Despite everything, it is a sight not to be missed."
"If you can, try pick a day that's not flooded with tourist. And you might need to book ticket online prior to your day of visit

(Not sure if the booking system works with foreign passport as it uses the Chinese personal ID card as the identifier"
"We had a private guide for 4 of us. Otherwise I don't think we would understand what we were seeing. Be prepared to do a lot of walking. There are lots of areas to see but although the signs are bilingual, there are not a lot of signs. However I felt the Forbidden city was magnificent. It was called Forbidden City because it was forbidden for common people to enter."
"Fascinating collection of artefacts, showing another world. Beautiful restoration work on some pieces. Must visit"
"One must need a tour guide to know Chinese ancient history. It's a long walking and showcasing kings throne chair. Places they are staying.

It's near Tiananmen Square.

I personally avoid such visit as one need to walk a long and no shelter."
"The Museum is placed in a huge and impressive building and should at least therefore be visited. It offers a permanent Exhibition of Chinese History. However, there is only Limited availability of selection of exhibitions. Be aware that a booking in advance might be helpful in saving time at the entrance. A passport is required for entry and selfie sticks are prohibited."
"We went first thing in the morning and a Chinese friend brought us the tickets online so we avoided the ticket queue. In a few months there is going to be an English website to buy the tickets in advance. At the moment the website is only in Chinese. You need your passports to pick up the tickets. They cost 60 yuan each.

We joined the crowds and visited all the main spots during the one way route to the exit. Impressive in size and number of buildings but lacking in decor within the palaces. A lot of the side palaces were closed. My favourite bit was the imperial garden even with the massive crowds."
"This place was so lovely and the combination of bright red building and the golden rooftop leave a great lasing impression. Also, its a famous landmark which had many tourists come and see. A must to visit if you are in Beijing!!!"
"I know that I should have liked this place more but it was very crowed and very hot on the day of our visit. It consists of a series of court yards and palaces which you can peer into. I had hoped to see artefacts but perhaps they are in the museum.
Perhaps a tour guide would have brought the place to life."
"In March 2017, I went to the Forbidden City - Palace Museum for perhaps the 5th time over a 10-year period. The last time I was there was in 2011 or early 2012. The procedures are different now because of increased security. I wrote ahead to my hotel before I left the USA and they went on-line and bought me an advanced ticket for 40 RMB (about 6 dollars). Once I checked in, I paid the hotel 40 RMB for my entry ticket (actually a voucher to be exchanged for your ticket at the Forbidden City). I went very early on a Sunday to the Tiananmen East subway station and got in line. Maybe at 8 AM. You are required to show your passport at the security checkpoint so bring your passport. I went in through the Tiananmen Gate with the picture of Chairman Mao. By the way since I know some Chinese, the Chinese to left and right of his picture says ""Long Live the People's Republic of China"" and ""Long live all the united peoples of the world"". Once inside, you need to go ahead to a special ticket booth for those who bought their tickets on-line. You exchange your on-line ticket for an actual ticket. After that, you then pass through another security checkpoint. Even though it was Sunday morning, the Forbidden City was mobbed with Chinese tourists. The middle parts of the Forbidden City were full of people - the various gates and halls. For me, the highlight is to the right side (East Side). First of all it is very quiet here. You can visit the Hall of Clocks which is amazing. It has ancient clocks from England, France, Switzerland, Japan, China and elsewhere. There is the nine-dragon screen (there is another one at Bei Hai Park). There are some other exhibits with various artifacts. Passing through all the gates and seeing the various halls can take about 1.5 to 2 hours. Then the Hall of Clocks, nine-dragon screen and other exhibits could take another hour. After that, if you are interested, you can go to visit the Eastern Palaces (I skipped this). Finally you end up in the Imperial Gardens and the North Exit. The whole visit to the Forbidden City took me close to 4 hours. It can take more or less time depending on how much you scrutinize everything. Once you exit you will be across the street from Jingshan Park. If you do not follow my advice (write for a ticket in advance and go early), you run the risk of being in a long line and waiting a long time. You can rent an audio-guide in English if you want to but also all the signs have Chinese and English explanations. I never get tired of visiting the Forbidden City even after my fifth time."
"We visited with our guide which was well worth the extra cash. He brought the place to life for us, giving it some depth. Lovely buildings and a snapshot into ancient China. The gardens were beautiful for spending some quiet time, it was busy but our guide knew the tricks and best route through. Also it was hit so take a sun shade or hat! Would highly recommend a visit."
"We visited the Forbidden City with my family. Before reaching the place you need to walk about 3 kms. Passing the Tiananmen Square. We were with a throng of people who were also eager to see the interesting ""Forbidden City"". Upon entering the massive gate, we are confronted with several entry gates before we finally reached the palace. I learned from our tour guide that the word ""Forbidden"" came from the fact that no one can enter the place without the permission of the Emperor during the ancient time. But now, the place is obviously no longer forbidden 😊. The China government already opened this most historical place to the public. Surrounding the palace are the homes of the wives of the Emperor. The palace has 9,999 rooms. Many of the buildings are still in its original state but there are also many parts that are already repaired. I felt so privileged to be able to walk on the ground of this UNESCO heritage site, where some of the bricks used on the ground are still from 1400's , the time that this place was built.

Tips:

1. Wear comfortable shoes because you will do a lot of walking.

2. Bring bottled water.

3. Wear appropriate clothing. We went during Early spring and it is still cold at times.

4. It helps if you read about the place before visiting it so that you will have a good background of the place.

5. If you are traveling with very young ones or very old ones, it helps if you have a stroller or wheel chair for them."
"This was a once in a life-time experience for me. Yes, it's crowded, but...being there and seeing so many Chinese people enjoying their history and taking pictures with us b/c Westerners are so unusual for many of the Chinese tourists from the countryside was an amazing experience. Give yourself a little extra time to visit the garden just before the exit.
Be sure to see ""The Last Emperor"" before your visit--it will make history come alive"
If you are interested in Chinese ancient history this is the right place to visit. Get an automated audio guide which tells you the details of each part of the palace that you entered or you may get lost ;)
"Is a replica of the original that burned down atound 1890. Has some interest because of its history but not really up there with places like the Pyramids, Petra, Machu Pichu, Collesseum etc"
"Hard to get to because as soon as you exit metro station you are in a security check queue for at least half an hour (providing you arrive at 7.30-8.00 in the morning). Once you pass the security check (try the one going to Tiananmen Square as you can underpass the road towards Forbidden City Gate), then it's pretty smooth. EVERYBODY follows the Central Axis itinerary and you won't see much if you do the same. Go to the East and Far East Palaces (pay like 20 RMB extra charge) but you will be nearly on your own. All the buidlings are the same but in the EAST section you have a little bit of variety. From the outside you won't see a difference so if you are only interested in the architecture rather than the inside (museum of different subjects), then the EAST is absolutely perfect for this. The WEST is not too bad either but much more crowded than the EAST. Just avoid the Central Axis, go in the early morning like aim to be at the Tiananmen Square at 7.30am, preferebly on a weekday and you will be absolutely fine. Make sure to visit the hill in front of the exit gate as you will have 360 degree view of Beijing and Forbidden City"
"Visited with the wife and enjoyed my visit here, but you can't actually enter the rooms, temples or throne areas...just photos from the entries. Go early as it gets extremely busy. Avoid the tea room scams. Pay about 200 cny for an English speaking guide who will escort you around for about 2 hours. This will avoid the ticket queues as they have online access to purchase tickets and you jump to the front of the line. 2 hours is about all you will need."
The forbidden city was large & extremely clean - building have plenty of history & police everywhere - felt very safe - I needed to get a wheelchair & pusher for the day for $60 - I could never have been able to see everything without the help - very tourist friendly
"i was on the subway buying some drinks in the vending machine when one lady friendly approached and told me that she'd visit the Forbidden city too. She introduced herself as an English teacher somewhere in the middle China and was in Beijing for a 4-day break. She asked me if she could join, chat and have some coffee.

I agreed and she brought me to a coffee shop just outside the palace. The coffee we ordered were Y45 and Y50 but they also served a complimentary cold tea and nuts. The bill came and I paid Y400 in all. I just realized afterwards that I spent $60 just for a cup of coffee.

The lady got my number and asked if I could join them for a karaoke night but I declined."
Very informative with a guide. Full of culture. Beautiful detail. Garden and grounds around the Forbidden city are well worth a look.
"The Forbidden City was the Chinese imperial palace from the Ming dynasty to the end of the Qing dynasty (1420 - 1912. Located in the center of Beijing, China, and now houses the Palace Museum. It served as the home of emperors and their households as well as the ceremonial and political center of Chinese government for almost 500 years. Worth visiting.."
"Having had the pleasure of enjoying visits to Palaces, Cathedrals and other edifices depicting lifestyles of leaders from the distant past in many countries, I never cease to be amazed at the opulence of their lifestyles, obviously at the expense of their dedicated (maybe not always voluntary) followers. The Forbidden City and the Imperial Palace and Museum in Beijing are certainly right up there with the best in that regard. A must visit in Beijing as attested to by over 50 million visitors a year ..it is claimed to be the most visited Museum in the World. It was wall to wall people when I was there, but it was a glorious sky blue, smog free day and a most enjoyable couple of hours."
"I went on an excursion with a group to this location. It was very hot so it got kind of boring after a while. It goes and goes and goes and there were lots and lots of people everywhere. So, if there was a line to see something, it was pushing and shoving. It has a great history and it is neat to see, but be prepared for lots of tourists."
"Beautiful architecture with even more interesting history - I highly recommend to hire a tour guide. That takes the while visit to absolutely new level...
Don't forget to take passport with you as the rule obviously is ""no passport, no ticket""."
"As with most tourist sites worth seeing in Beijing, go early if you can to avoid the heat and crowds. You will be approached by many ""tour guides"" prior to entering the City. Suggest you pay the 40 rmb for the electronic audio guide which we found was as good and less expensive then a guide. Unless you are really really interested in the history of the City, you can go from front to back in about 2 hours."
Wow 300 hundred girlfriends...... just amazing and the architecture of the place it outstanding. Make sure you get there nice and early was a large line but but once we got through security was easy to walk around. Can also book tickets on line if you have a personal tour guide
Our group of 8 had an amazing walk through history with our guide May from China Highlights. The line up were busy but we were told not as busy as during high season. We were fortunate that we had a guide as it expedited our time in lines to get in! May's adaptability was appreciated as we had children with us.
"Absolutely Facinating!!! This was a lot bigger than I was expecting, book onto a tour so that you hear the stories behind the emperors of China."
"We could have spent an entire day wandering around the Forbidden City... There was so much to see, and a variety of attractions (from the rose garden, to the calligraphy, the overall grounds, etc). Would recommend you visit this iconic place!"
"This is a site that you must visit one time just to say that you have been there. Except for the outside of lots of buildings and nice courtyards, there isn't much to see. Expect big crowds and long lines. There are several five star restrooms."
"I guess it would have been interesting to see if you can actually get close enough to see something.. You need to wait in a very long line to enter, then everyone is pushing you, so it's very difficult to enjoy the place."
"the visit to the forbidden city was very interesting.
it shows the old china traditions and politics."
It's a must go place every time visiting Beijing. You may want to reserve the ticket online esp. during high season. You can generally ask your hotel to provide RSVP information. It's very worth it visiting and every time is delightful and breathtaking of how magnificent this palace is. Plan for a full day and lots of walking and stay hydrated!
"860 years ago Beijing first became the capital of China, since then this old tough city survived countless wars. The forbidden city stood there watching dynasties changed and changed again. Inside, ancient breeze touches your cheek, telling you all those ancient stories, all the laughter and tear and blood spilled on those stone roads.
It is highly recommended to get to know a little bit of Chinese history before you step in, or you may not get all the charm."
The forbidden city is a classic monument of chinese history. A long and bit hectic walk through the complete place but its trully work the effort. Great history and exposure to a rich culture and architecture.
"Spectacular destination for anyone visiting Beijing. This place is truly fascinating and you can feel the history and importance when you arrive. A guide was essential in order to explain the history of the city, however the scale of this place was insane."
"This is a must see place, but don't forget to bring your tennis shoes and sun block is you go during summer time. there is a lot of walking. Experience was really nice, you just have to get used to be pushed by chinesse, which is in their culture. It took us at least 2 hours to walk it, but it was worth it. It is full of history and beauty."
"Sadly that today's visit to the Forbidden City did not meet my expectations, or maybe I was just so overwhelmed by the volume of people. Approximately, 80 000 people A Day go through the place. Be prepared to be jostled, pushed and shoved. For many Chinese people this is their trip of a life time so I can't blame them for being pushy. If you do a tour you will find that your guide will start your day at Tiananmen Square and you will walk you way through the Square and on to the Forbidden Place. Be aware that you may be asked for your passport and identification. If you don't you can get in trouble. It's a bit over rated preferred the Wu Gardens in Shanghai. However, the architect is very interesting and our guide was fairly knowledgeable about the information on the buildings in dynasties.
I found the following Beijing Hutong tour a waste of time and was uncomfortable going into someone home, and of course the are artists and you may like to buy something.... over all the history is awesome and I haven't really been disappointed."
Nice architecture and well preserved. Heard many interesting stories about Forbidden City so I made it a point to visit this place when I was in Beijing. It didn't impress me but I would recommend others to visit here.
When you stand in the courtyard of some of the buildings you can almost picture what life was so many years ago. It was something that I have always wanted to see. I am still in awe.
I absolutely loved the Forbidden City. The combination of bright red buildings and the golden rooftops leave a great lasting impression. The only downside is the crowd. Be prepared for a large crowd and a long security line.
"When you come to Beijing you HAVE to go to the Forbidden City. Its architecture and size are incredible. If you leave Beijing without visiting it, you did something wrong. Bring your Passport and do go on Mondays (it's closed)."
The Forbidden City is a famous landmark and can get very busy. A guide is a must to explain the history of the place. There is quite a lot of walking and steps to be climbed as you proceed through the sections. You can take photographs and walk about freely and westerners are frequently photographed by locals including being in a dreaded selfie which is the in thing. Just smile.
I have visited here after lots of recommendation given by my office colleagues.The place is good and very big.You have to be ready to walk at-least 2 KM.The ticket will cost you RMB 60 if you are a visitor. Remember to carry your passport while visting this because the give ticket by registering your Passport.Worth to watch if you want to learn some history of your visiting places.They also provide audio guide for RMB 40.
"This place is a must-see in Beijing. It can be directly accessed from Tiananmen square (and metro). The Forbidden City is wirth the money and the trip. Speaking of money, at the entrance, a lot of people will offer their tour guide services. Don't take it since they ask for cca 150-200 RMB and you can buy automated tour guide for 30-40RMB."
This was a wonderful spot. It is very beautiful but very large. It takes a long time to visit most of it but worth the time for sure. It was very crowded when we were there and very hot. It has been well maintained and so it is easy to imagine it during the days it was in use.
I was astonished at the size of the forbidden city. What a sight and a must see. Make sure to be there a bit before 8:30AM to buy your tickets. Must do in Beijing.
Also known as the former seats of the Emperors throughout Ming and Qing dynasties. This palatial area has architectural master pieces of various homes to emperors and their concubines.Vast structures to see and grounds that has lots of walking involved.
"I found this fascinating . We had a tour guide ,so we got lots of info as to how it was and how they lived in the past . A must see"
"The Forbidden City is huge. I'd recommend having plenty of time to explore. It was very warm when we were there and after climbing The Great Wall in the morning we were getting tired. Carry your passport with you, over 60 year olds get in half price.
The city is huge and seemed to go on forever, very well preserved and so interesting to view. I'd recommend this to any traveller to Beijing."
"Wonderfully presented important historic site. Busy and interesting area, but you should have a guide to understand the historical significance of the various areas. Beautiful site definitely a must do for any visitors"
"Behind Tiennmen square,this place is a palace and not city basically. Ancient times the normal people are not allowed to enter in king palace hence the name Firbidden city. Good long walk and nice structure.

The area near Forbidden city are filled with old structures. Found some good photography points. Enjoy.."
"Before I start with review there is few things I want you to know . Time , weather condition and day of week very important to pay attention when visiting . It's outdoor so try to go on not rainy day if possible . Try to go on work day and no weekends or holidays and since pollution is very bad try to go early . When paying for ticket I recommend paying extra 40rmb and get gps mobile guide. It will tell you all about buildings and history of the place when walking trough it . Forbidden city is huge so you will need 3 or lite hours to see it all and be ready to walk a lot . There is many buildings but yiu can't go in but you cab take photo from outside and lots to see while walking ... carved stones and sculptures . I had great time and I hope you will to. Have a nice and safe travel . My Instagram mr1_travel. Thank you"
"Enjoyed a tour around the Forbidden City and it was absolutely fascinating! The history, the architecture, the life that went on here, so very interesting. Our guide really brought the history to life!"
"The walk to the ticket booth and then through the Forbidden City which is a large brick or concrete or similar is ver draining. There is water for sale which is at reasonable prices.

It was hard to look into many of the Palaces due to the crowds.
We're glad we went but be prepared for the crowds & heat."
"Big open spaces and alot of walking. Great learning the history of the forbidden city.
Amazing and beautiful buildings."
"Be prepared for heaps of tourists like yourself, but the whole experience is awesome!. Just imagining how people lived in such a micro environment is fascinating."
"For the price you pay The Palace Museum is well worth it! You will never find as good a deal as you will here for museum admission! Well worth the money!!! Lots of different exhibits rotating around these museums, but the views and architecture warrant the money unto itself. DO NOT MISS!!!!!!!!!"
"It is worthwhile trying to plan your visit on a weekday and in the afternoon when crowds seem to be less. After your visit you should watch the movie ""The Last Emperor""."
"It was incredible and a rich historical visit ! we just loved it ! to learn different stories from different emperoors and how they spent their life inside the city walls, all the simbólic and philosofical meaning of particularizeis of the chinese culture was fascinating ! We loved it !"
"Worth every penny/cent/RMB. Old Chinese buildings at their best. The only problem is that the place can be extremely crowded, especially during high season."
"This is an amazing place to visit it gets very busy and be prepared to get pushed about but it's definitely worth the visit, we had a guide who was so informative and told us so much about the forbidden city great trip it's a must"
"I always knew that the Forbidden City was a 'City within a City', but this did not quite prepare me for the immense scale of the site. The buildings are beautiful and it is great to just soak up the atmosphere. It is best to visit with a guide who can tell you all about the fascinating history of the site and ours was very knowledgeable about the history and practices of the Forbidden City. There are an awful lot of tourists visiting at any one time, which can make it difficult to see into buildings from viewing platforms, I did give up in the end and just enjoyed the architecture. There is also a rather lovely garden in the 'women’s section'. This is definitely a must see when in Beijing."
"Do yourself a favor and NEVER plan a trip here on the weekend unless you're forced to like I was. Thousands of people crowding around trying to take photos. The worst part about this day was getting in line half an hour before the dates even opened, to then entering through the meridian gate and 10 minutes later, finding out that security had blocked the entire path along the central axis hence all the people were shuttled either to the east or west. When I reached the exit, I noticed that throngs of people were leaving through the center as well and realized that the route had been opened once again. I walked back the entire length of the forbidden city along the center and then again to the exit! None of the guards spoke English when I asked why they were so aggressively keeping people out! Be warned that this may happen dying your visit as well and be prepared to walk a lot. The buildings themselves, having visited the palaces in Seoul and Taiwan, were of the same style of architecture. If you have explored a lot of Asia, the only truly impressive things were the scale of the palace grounds, the stone carvings and the interesting trees and rocks in the imperial garden."
We were amazed at the size of the complex and glad we were there before the height of tourist season! There is a lot to see and it is definitely worthwhile visiting. The grounds are immense and there are vendors in case you need a snack or a cold drink. You may wish to bring a hat as it can be very hot and you are mainly outside. The gardens are very unique and we enjoyed them. There are also souvenir shops if you feel like picking up a memory of your visit. Warning - There is a bathroom at the entrance and one at the exit but none in between!!
"Crazy crowded, but a must see of course. Take lots of water. Be ready to be in crowds. The museum was interesting and has rotating exhibits. Walk the wall around the city."
"I had no comprehension of the size of the Forbidden City before visiting - it is huge.

The design of the fortifications are amazing, the concept of the various squares etc is fascinating.

The gardens are an tranquil space to spend time in too.

Ok - so you only see a very little of the inside of the buildings, but if you have a guide you will learn so much of the Imperial history of China. Using a guide also allows you to avoid some of the queues and the earlier you go the better!"
We were part of a Sinorama travel group. We had 2 guides which was SO HELPFUL to learn the history of the Forbidden City (The Emperor's Palace). It was off limits to commoners for centuries! You will walk and walk and walk... this location is MASSIVE. Allow 3 to 4 hours to appreciate this unique part of Chinese history. It's challenging to capture pictures to fully show its beauty!
the history itself is mind blowing to actually walk the grounds is surreal. again comfy shoes is required for sprawling Palace. Highly recommend a guide to share the history as you go from room to room just so fascinating!
Amazing...it was another Chinese Masterpiece that you do not want to miss. To go through history and see the things they had thousands of years ago was stupendous.
"We visited this place after we had walked around Tiananmen Square. Our Chinese guide was able to tell us so much about the huge palace with its many buildings etc. We have never seen the film ""The Last Emperor"", but were told that it was filmed here - we now want to get a copy of the DVD.

We cannot recommend this highly enough - it is a most awe-inspiring place!"
A trip to Beijing is not complete if you haven't visited the Forbidden Palace! The palace compound huge and certainly full of history.
"Wonderful place. Buildings and history are incredible. Lots to see here.
Several building as you walk along each decorated with beautiful colours. Simply shunning"
"Enjoyed time spent here, our English speaking tour guide was very good, well worth the visit. Being in a group an advantage."
"The Forbidden City is a must on every tourists list when they visit Beijing.
We visited with a guide organised by our hotel who purchased our tickets online the night before.
There were large crowds getting through security which did spread out once we were inside although trying to take photos without people and selfie sticks in the way was quite a challenge.
The whole area is huge, lots of walking and open to the elements.
I think a guide is definitely recommended to explain the history and architecture."
Worth the money to go inside the palace. It's a lovely area and it's full of history. A nice after spent here
"The history of the Forbidden City great, it is huge beautiful palace to watch, nice place for photographs, need at half a day to enjoy the beauty, but it make one tired if the sun is out."
The forbidden city was disappointing to me. I felt that it's like a labyrinth. Everything looks the same and you jut get deeper and deeper into it
"Historically, I had to go here to see it. But unless they are having something special, I don't necessarily need to go back."
"I had goosebumps when I visited the Forbidden City in 1989 in my early youth, realizing that I was walking in a place designed for one person, the Emperor of China and that this was my Chinese heritage. Fast forward to 2017 and it is still an amazing place to visit, such history, beautiful architecture, attention to detail and symmetry, so much to see in a few hours! I don't know enough to give you the history or details, but this is truly an incredible place. I know that we walked in from the gate on the left of the Meridian Gate (that's where our bus dropped us off) and walked all the way to the north gate to exit. Our tour group spent about an afternoon there but we could have spent the entire day easily."
Located in the centre of the city. A huge palace with loads of history. I recommend getting a auto guide and understand what each palaces was...
"Spent most of a day walking around and thru the city today. Amazing architecture but since most of the rooms are closed it's mostly window shopping.
Spend time in the garden, if you have time. It's way more natural than concrete and bricks."
"I cannot put the beauty that this place has, into words. Not only was there a lot of walking (which I hate) but I thought every step was worth it. My favorite part is that you can see the city of Beijing over the roof tops of the temples and each one has its own rules. Each building or section of the place had a number and the number represented the power one possessed. Great place for photos as well."
"In the centre of Beijing an Imperial palace from the Ming dynasty the home of the last Emperor of China and others before him.If you are going to visit watch the film The Last Emperor giving you an insight of its history. I advise you have a guide as they explain interesting facts about the palace.
It costs about 60 yuan entrance fee under £10. Guides extra.
I advise that if you take children cover up as it gets very hot in China and the palace is very big and not all areas can be entered.
It is a very interesting place to visit about China's history and culture."
"went there in a Thursday morning not expecting to see the masses of people waiting in line just to get though security, that said once you are in its a wonderful and fascinating place , need to allow plenty of time to stroll around and take it all in"
As we were on a tour we were taken through the central part of the city. You only see the outside of the buildings and the couple that have anything inside are almost impossible to see in due to the crowds. We were not given the chance to see the museum which I believe had some interesting artefacts so I was tending to get a bit bored as all the buildings basically looked the same.
Honestly if you aren't into architecture then it's just another Asian temple that you pay to see. It means nothing to western people so you end up walking around aimlessly to find the exit. Not something I particularly enjoyed but I've seen a lot of the same type recently. Another tick in the box I guess.
"There is way too much history and culture here that is totally wasted if you don't read Chinese. The number of tourists, even in May, was very high."
"Our visit to the Forbidden City was on a warm day during a national holiday. And while it was busy, it was still manageable. The palace is an amazing place to see! Large courtyards, massive gates, and large, immaculate buildings with amazing shapes and colors! The only drawback I can think of is that the architecture of the whole place is similar, so the buildings start to look the same. Because of that it is not necessary to spend a lot of time there. But you do need to go, just to catch a glimpse of Imperial China."
"Forbidden City is a mandatory stop if you are in Beijing. Entry is from the south gate only, just north of Tiananmen Square, and you need a photo ID. Once inside the huge Forbidden City complex, the only exit is on the north side, so expect to do a lot of walking. But it's worth it--Forbidden City is an amazing array of buildings (most are replicas now) typical of the dynastic era. See the movie, ""The Last Emperor,"" to get a flavor of this complex. The main buildings get the most attention from the crowds (and there are crowds), but if you slink off to the side buildings you can get away from most of the tourists and have a quiet moment alone in antiquity."
I can't describe the size of Forbidden City you must visit it and see it with your own eyes. It's stunning and full of history and spirit
Great to walk through the history of this amazing place. Beautiful photographic opportunities. Took a few hours to walk through the Forbidden City. Towards the end the buildings seemed to get repetitive.
"The Chinese love their most important cultural sites. No matter what time you visit; it will be busy, but if you go early enough, there is a change to have rare moments of quiet. Most of the locals will focus on the main buildings the ones in the middle), which leaves you the opportunity to explore the surroundings. The surrounding buildings have their own charm and they are often in better condition. There as fascinating details along the way, that are much overlooked. I personally loved the lotus flower wallpaper and the dragons on the doors. Is it a tourist trap? YES. Is it busy? YES. Is it worth the hassle? YES. It is beautiful ancient place and as much as the wall, should be on your list.

NOTE! In order to gain entrance, you need ID (preferably Passport)"
"Great history here, make sure you allow at least half a day though! There's a lot to see and I recommend getting the audio tour guide which is available in many languages."
just 3 tips....closed monday....bring walking shoes and passport (we didnt know you needed photo id..lucky we had our australian drivers licence)
"It's one of those things that you do because it's of immense cultural significance with a great history to learn about, so yes, I'd do it once with a good tour guide. However, the experience itself can be a bit stressful with too many tourists and tour groups and it's a really long tour, so can be tiring, especially in the heat. It's not a place I'd go back to for a second time."
"Forbidden City is a battleground in which tourists can shove and push their way into a position where they can take a crooked picture of some chair where some guy sat sometime in history. The Square outside the Forbidden City was far more impressive than the repetitive squares inside the walls. The end spits you out on some street far from most metro stops. You're going to see this because of what it is, but the environment and tangible sights were not impressive to me."
"Basically the only wooden structures in Beijing. Fabulous history, a must see, wear good shoes lots of walking."
"remember the scenes you saw in movies and dramas? you can walk into it. excellent!

if you want to take good pictures, you got to be as rough as the people around you.

note:
1) bring your passport with you. you need it to purchase tickets
2) opens at 8.30am but suggest to head there earlier. taxi is unable to stop there. can take subway to qianmen or tiananmen east stn. or simply ask driver to drop you somewhere near there.
3) entrance is ONLY via south gate, exit ONLY via north gate. so if your driver drops u at north gate, ask him to fly kite bcos that is an no entry exit.
4) go early as there are few security checks along the way from mrt to going into the palace.
5) bring food n water in for brunch.
6) the no. of visitor allowed per day is not unlimited. chinese citizen able to buy online while tour agencies also booked tickets ahead of time."
"Forbidden City is probably one of the top must see places for lovers of ancient history, heritage sites.
Sprawling area with buildings that will amaze you with their grandeur and planning.
Well maintained place.
Well managed too considering the visiting crowds.
Recommend advance planning.
Must see:)"
"Can not go to Beijing without seeing the forbidden city. So big you can not see it in one trip. This is my second time & I still have not seen everything. Read the guide books before hand or have a guide to really enjoy the history here. Very crowded, of course."
"While it was well-maintained and fascinating in design, the crowds shoving and jockeying for position required more spatial alertness than other sites. It was impossible to approach the indoor displays so we saw little beyond the exterior buildings."
"I led a group to this attraction and one of them was not able to walk up and down steps easily, particularly with no hand rails. I understand hand rails would distract from the natural historical site and was excited to see they had a ""handicapped accessible map"" on-line. A route you could push a wheelchair through. However, to say this is ""accessible"" is quite a stretch. The surface is quite bumpy and uneven...my guest had quite a body jolt! There were times she had to get out of the chair and walk over openings, etc., and she was really unable to see most of the main attractions of the City. There were so many people there, that viewing from ""afar"" wasn't possible...she could only see people! And pushing the chair through all the people is difficult at best. I think there's a long way to go before this would be a place that a disabled person could enjoy easily"
"The palace complex is huge with many different buildings and courtyards. You really need a guide to explain the significance and the history of the different parts of what was once truly forbidden to ordinary citizens and how the Emperors lived their lives.
Awesome!!"
"By far the worst tourist attraction in Beijing. The security was so stringent we queued for quite a bit in the sun before we could get in. Once outside the Forbidden City itself another one just before entering the main compound.

And there was too many tourists it was so difficult to enjoy and appreciate the place. We could barely see anything as it was always blocked by the Chinese tourists who kept pushing and knocking you.

Such a pity as I believe the attraction is a magnificent. I wonder how they maintain the quality of the buildings when about 50,000 people are allowed to trample all over the place each day."
"We wen to the Forbidden City an early Monday and find out that every single Monday is closed, but we enjoyed the side gardens (which luckily were open). So we returned on Thursday and saw the magnificents constructions, but got really disappointed by the hordes of people (tourists) that were trying to take a selfie in front of the throne room. People were really mean to each other just to get the right picture. They even bypass the barrier to get a perfect picture. That was the downside of our visit to this magnificent place. Please schedule a whole day of visit if you want to see everything, since this place is huge. Also plan to have a very comfortable shoes."
Loved forbidden city you must see it. Was very buzy id recommended going early if possible. Bring a packed lunch if possible and take your time exploring the city.
Came here with a tour we booked from conquer the wall marathon. This city is huge and there are so many level to it. Got some amazing picture and our guide was amazing. Wish we could have seen more of the city and the building but all in all it was a must see and the history here is unreal.
"Apart from being vast, this place is better appreciated if you have a tour guide explaining details and history to you. It is definately a must see when in Beijing. If you have seen the Last Emperor by Bernardo Bertolucci you will be reminded of the amazing stories and scenery."
"Forbidden City is a must visit along with Summer Palace and Tianenman Square for tourists visiting Beijing. If you want to see it properly, will take at least 2 hrs."
would recommend visiting the forbidden city with a guided tours as they would be able to explain in details various histories and the meaning behind the artifacts and the infrastructure.
We traveled with a tour group. This is a gorgeous example of Ming dynasty construction. Wear your walking shoes. It is quite large and you can easily spend a good half a day exploring all the palaces
"This palace seems to be a large square surrounded by walls leading into another large square etc. If you go around the temples you can wind up in an area of mazes and secret corners. You just have to get away from the beaten path ( as much as you can here ) and explore. Security is everywhere but not obstructive.

The palace faces Tianemen square. We thought the polution was bad but then we found out that it was mostly sand from a major sand storm hitting a third of China from the Gobi desert."
"Not as spectacular as I was led to believe. The buildings are very much the same all the way through, once you've seen one you've basically seen the rest."
"Visiting the Forbidden City is certainly one of the absolute highlights of every China tour. The buildings are majestic and it will take about half a day to see and appreciate everything. We were lucky as there were not too many tourists the afternoon we visited. I'm also happy we had a guide who explained us everything, I guess alone it is much more difficult to understand what you see. I appreciated many of the architectural details and the beautiful garden, too. Definitely a must-see."
"If you are in Beijing - its a must you visit Forbidden City. A lot of history attached of the past, when, the various emperors used have both pleasure and biz. Crowded most of the times, however, that does not matter."
Not as impressive as we thought but nevertheless a must see when visiting Beijing. Unfortunately it is hard to get a good look at the inside of the buildings.
Plan half a day. Stat by the south Entrance. Take the time to understand what you are surrounded with. My best visit was my 3 rd one. Avoid at any cost visits of weekend and this is THE thing all Chinese tourists want to visit.
"We learned so much about this City and it's use back in the days of Royals, we had amazing weather in late April, great historical place to visit when in Beijing."
"This place is amazing in both size and cultural experience. The vastness of the palace is amazing , the buildings are inspiring and the intricate nature of the roofs have to be seen. Make sure you allow plenty of time when visiting , but it is definitely worth the effort."
"Like stepping back to Imperial times. The preserved architecture is stunning to experience, and the sheer size of the Forbidden City is mind boggling. It was interesting to learn so much about the cultural and political history of the palace. It was a great experience to walk where emperors once walked."
"This is a historical pin point you must go too, it has rick culture and super informative we used the headset that translated everything, you really don't need a tour guide. There is a lot of walking and many different time frames you can walk to see all of it or some of it...the shortest route is approximately 90min but it's def with it!!!!"
There were a lot of people when we went and even though the people disperse well they do congregate around the main viewing areas so it is hard to read information and understand the history. I think it was a little over rated but it may be better if you went with a guide.
"Huge area, better to visit on your own. Avoid using tour agent if you are interested to explore more on this place. You can get an audio guide at the entrance RMB20 for Chinese language and RMB40 for foreign languages. Do expect a lot of walking too."
"Nothing to see... Only houses, you cannot visit inside any building. There are 2 expositions inside for which you must pay extra."
"it is a must see location in Beijing. but, allow yourself alot of time. it is an incredible site to see and I would imagine it would take several trips to see it all and although all of it is not open to the public it is definitely a must see location."
"I spent about 6 hours exploring this huge and beautiful complex. There are lots of tourists, of course, and it is hard to appreciate the interiors of the various halls because they are cornered off and hundreds of people are pushing to take photographs at the side doors. Still, it is an amazing place and late afternoon, close to closing time it becomes empty and even more beautiful. So start leisurely and make sure you stay on when everybody starts leaving. The various exhibitions in the side palaces are absolutely worth visiting, especially the living quarters of Empress Cixi (? not sure of spelling).
Take your passport with you as tickets are not sold without ID. I found the audio guide useful to have, cost only 40 Yuan."
"Awesome structures in the middle of Beijing. Youll need about 3-4 hours here, great pictures. Take hat as youll be outdoors"
"Wonderful buildings
Neat
Colourful
Busy
Lots of walking

Nice 👍

Go slow and enjoy the surroundings

Good for pictures"
"Barrier after barrier protecting emperors from foes and at the same time creating the aura of supreme status. Architecture is a continuum of instant reply, but totally amazing immensity and size of the entire complex is breath-taking"
Loved it an amazing trip to think walking over the courtyard where the emperor lived ... it's a lot of walking so take comfortable shoes ... the que for buying a ticket was a wait long about 25min que but well worth it be ware there are people that will come up to you offering tours and quick ticket purchases for 300 Along with a guide for 2 hours ... we were very reluctant to do this and we were glad we walked around alone ... make sure you take some ID when purchasing the ticket only for name printing they are very strict on this policy I didn't have any but I had my passport number saved in my I phone notes which they excepted ... 2 adult and 2 child tickets were a total of 160 around £14 very cheap .. a taxi from our hotel was 30min which seems to be a average ride to most places here was 60 £6 ... really enjoyed this place worth going great trip
"Number one tip! Bring your passport with you to gain access to get in. We only discovered this the day before when we were on route to The Square.

The signage is pretty horrendous and it's initially fairly hard to work out where to buy tickets and how it works. You will need to check in all bags (even some purses) at some of the the attractions for about RMB3. Don't bother arguing- no option! You can take cameras, phones, wallet and passport with you.

You can take photos at the majority of The exhibitions with the exception of a few.

What was the most enjoyable part of the visit for me was the gardens. Absolutely stunning and the scale was massive. Gorgeous and an impressive collection of stunning flowers.

The palace is closed routinely Mondays"
"This is a fantastic site. The buildings do get abit samey after while, so take a tour, get a guide or research in advance to make the most of what the buildings are and they're significance"
"very cool historic site to see -- although it is a MASSIVE complex! Be ready for a LOT of walking and not a lot of shade. Bring lots of water. It was very crowded the day that we went there - we were told that 80,000 people per day go there and that the afternoon is less crowded time to visit. Everyone goes in the morning for the flag ceremony."
Had done some research on the City and it was interesting to hear what the guide had to say about the city and when asked questions about the repairs having been done due to it being nearly in ruins- the guide stated that it never was in ruins but repairs were required to keep it in its state
"Definitely a must see. Above it all, the detachment of the emperors from the people they ruled and the opulence of their life style is amazing. But I guess if you are heavenly it figures. Be prepared to take your time. Also be prepared to push and shove to get at certain vantage points."
"Beijing has been capital of China many times, for many decades along the Chinese history. The name of the palace as Forbidden city is because in ancient China where Empire still exists, the palace in which the royal family lives is inaccessible to the normal citizen or even government officials. Forbidden city is always the empire's palace, where the emperor runs the country, makes decisions, meets officials, holds meetings and state visits. It also has the private living area for the emperor and his families.

in Today's China, the palace simply turns to a museum."
How emperors and their entourage lived inside. Learnt about the history of the palace and dynasties.
"Some amazing buildings, but after long day on tour felt it was just to big to enjoy. Just a series of buildings you are not allowed to enter. But still a must see."
"A caveat: we did not have a guide, and I've read many reviews from people who had guides and really enjoyed the Forbidden City. I personally don't think that a guide should be necessary to make such a historic site even bearable!

The organization on site was ridiculous. I understand that they need to flow thousands of people through each day, so it wasn't even the long lineups that bothered me. For independent visitors, it was extremely difficult to know where to go to even buy tickets to get in, and that was after we queued for 60 minutes to get through security, then fumbled around in the first courtyard searching for the ticket gate. Tip: do not buy the tickets in the first courtyard. Those are for the Tiananmen Gate. Go to the second courtyard for tickets for the Forbidden City (and you thought you were already inside). Also, be sure to bring your passports, as we saw foreigners refused tickets without passport IDs. What a shame to spend all that time waiting to get in, and be denied entry!

The signage was terrible not just for logistics, as mentioned above, but for interpretation as well. No maps, and the few information boards were not terribly interesting or useful. We had a guidebook with us, which helped us navigate, and you can rent audioguides on site. There was not really much to see after you go through gate after similar gate. A couple of rooms have been glassed off so you can peek inside, but good luck getting through the mobs of people for a good close up look. The imperial gardens at the north end were nice to walk through.

The Forbidden City is definitely a place to knock off your list if that's your thing, but if you have limited time in Beijing and somehow can't make it to the site, don't fret about it. You will see that beautiful carved and painted wooden architecture everywhere in China; you could even go to Lama Temple instead. Then watch a documentary on the history of the Forbidden City."
"Was amazed by the architectural structures of this place and it was beautiful. learnt alot on chinese history. This place is massive! Dont forget to bring snack food and water and go there early to avoid long que for tickets and hot spots. When you exit through the last gate, cross the road and hike up a bit to Jingshan hill and take a nice panoramic view of whole forbidden city from the hill."
"We visited the forbidden city on a Tuesday in April 2017. We arrived about 10:30am and exited the Beijing subway station ""Tiananmen east"" which is on line 1 (red line). There are several exits out of the station, one will take you out to the Tiananmen Square side and another exit will bring you out across the wide road near the Forbidden City entrance.
Now this is some advice to take note of. The forbidden city is closed every Monday, so like we discovered Tuesday is a bad bad day to try and visit.
The queues on both sides of the road were like something I had never seen before, probably without any exaggeration maybe 150-200meters long, ten plus people wide, and it's china so squashed up tightly to each other. There were literally thousands of people queuing.
We decided to give it a miss this day and come early the next day which turned out to be a great plan.
On our second attempt to visit the Forbidden City we decided to get there for opening time at 08:30am. We also decided to cycle from our hotel (Pentahotel) to ""Tiananmen east"" subway station to avoid the mad morning crush on their underground.
The cycle was less than 10 minutes from our hotel and a great laugh and a experience I would highly recommend.
Once we arrived at ""Tiananmen east"" subway station on the side of the road to the entrance of Forbidden City we found a area by the traffic lights to leave and lock our bikes up.
Now this is a great tip for anyone.
If you are outside ""Tiananmen east"" subway station on the side of the street of the forbidden city main south entrance (which has the famous portrait of Mao Zedong on the front) you need to walk back on yourself and away from the queue and entrance towards the traffic lights. Turn left down the street at the traffic lights and you will find many English speaking Chinese tour guides that have ID cards and can skip the queues.
We met one called Jack ( I have his card somewhere) who for 100¥ walked us up the street and away from the crowds to the east entrance and straight in the forbidden city missing all the queues... AMAZING.
He knew all the police and security at the gate and then walked us back to the south entrance from inside the premises so we could take pictures of the famous portrait of Mao Zedong, and begin our tour of Forbidden City from there.

The grounds to this place are massive with nearly 780000 square meters and a total of 8,700 rooms.

You can collect a audio guide to listen to the history of this place and just spend a couple of hours just wandering around.
It is a must visit attraction in Beijing, especially as you now know how to beat the queues."
DON'T forget your drivers license or passport to enter the Forbidden City. This information not clearly indicated in reviews or related websites.
"Visited both Tiananmen Square and the Forbidden City, a very comfortable pace was set over a few hours by our knowledgeable and very proud local guide, Lin from Wendy Wu.
Ensure you take plenty of water and have plenty of room on your memory card as you will not stop taking photos'."
"By all means do not miss the forbidden city but make sure you have on good walking shoes because it is a big place with lots to see. There are lots of stairs, nothing is a long way up or down there is just the need to traverse several staircases to see the rooms up close. This is an attraction should you not hurry through and the taped guide is excellent for knowing exactly what you are seeing and why t is significant. The life of an emperor in China comes to life here."
"Another must see in Beijing. Many many tourist and was very congested.
Beautiful architecture, but was very difficult to get to see everything as you had to jostle for a spot with the 1000's of people."
You could spend day sun this place. It is full of locals and tourists. I don't think that I want to go back but it is a must see
Beautiful place- big place. Spent a lot of time here. Our guide--Bill did a wonderful job explaining everything.
"An amazing place full of stories, history and brilliant architecture. Go with a guide to avoid disappointment and enable you to understand the stories and history of this truly amazing palace. The size, scope and day to day life of the ancients must have been mind blowing. We started from Tianamen square and continued it was a lot of walking so wear comfortable shoes, a full day so take some water, keep your eyes on the guides flag as there are thousands of people and, hundred groups and as many flags. Great photo opportunities. You will not be disappointed only amazed. Great experience."
"The first thing to say is that the Forbidden City is unmissable and is huge, so wear comfortable shoes,take a drink and be prepared for the crowds.There are numerous palaces ( or Halls), gates, buildings and courtyards to see - and don't just concentrate on the main, large ones running through the middle of the site as there are some fascinating side buildings and courtyards (and taking time to see them helps you appreciate the sheer scale of the Forbidden City).Towards the end is a garden/rockery, and once outside you can appreciate the walls and moat that totally surrounds the site.
The buildings are beautiful if a little samey and it is disappointing that none of the halls are actually entered but viewed from outside through door/window openings - so be prepared to join and compete with the scrum of photographers for photos of thrones, ornaments, pillars etc - but do not miss it!"
"We did it together with Tiananmen Square so there was a lot of walking.
English speaking people need a guide to fully appreciate the history & culture.
Worth a half day visit."
An outstanding location. The city has so many stories to tell and our guide Lily from Odyssey tours was fantanstic. Thanks Lily
We had a tour guide that was very helpful. Without one I don't think I would have understood all the history and culture involved.
"Visited here as part of a tour so was combined with Tiananmen Square. If you come here on your own (not part of an arranged tour) just be aware that only a certain amount of tickets are sold daily by 11 am so there are massive crowds that gather at the gates in an attempt to purchase the tickets. Very busy place and lots of walking. You could spend hours here but the tours seem to spend about 90-120 minutes. Places for sitting, some shade (not a lot) and purchasing refreshments plus there are bathrooms. Great pictures to take."
"The Forbidden City is one of the most important palaces in the world (along with Chateau de Versailles, Kremlin, White House & Buckingham palace) and the largest ancient palatial structure in the world. It is also the best preserved imperial palace in China.
What to say about this site: it is gigantic. It covers an area of about 72 hectares (178 acres) with a total floor space of approximately 150,000 square meters (1,600,000 square feet). It consists of 90 palaces and courtyards, 980 buildings and 8,704 rooms!!
This is for facts & numbers. Now, my impression when visiting. First, the crowd. We arrived early in the morning but still had to queue up (not too long) to get in as there were already thousands of people visiting. The first courtyards are usually packed. And when you have to pass through the different gates it creates a bottleneck you have to manage (do not leave young children out of your sight). But, this is understandable in a way as it is one of the major attractions in Beijing. I would avoid going on weekends but we had no choice when visiting.
We hired a guide before the visit so that he could guide us through the different areas of the Forbidden City (gates, great halls, palaces, side halls, treasure gallery, courtyards, imperial garden) and tell us about history as we went along. But also about fine details and what they mean but that you do not notice if you are not aware.
We even found quiet areas in some of the courtyards and in the treasure gallery.

What I loved the most were the rooftops details. It was important to look up to discover all the roof decorations and figures like the ""walking beasts"", those statuettes placed along the ridge line of official buildings of the Chinese empire. You can also see them when visiting the lama temple in Beijing (which was a former imperial palace)."
"This is as good as it gets

Have a guide to make sure you don't miss anything

Its easy to recall the film, but the film film made on a smaller 'mock up'in a different part of china

An adorable place to visit"
"We didn't have a guide, so really just felt it was another old building to walk through. It's crowded and there is no one willing to help if you need any type of directions. The surrounding area is quite interesting to walk through."
"Having walked right up to the Forbidden City numerous times, I took my wife for her first time. I attempted to walk across the street, when a policeman put his hand in front of me and said, "" must go in line!"". I looked back to a que of maybe 600 people. We were pushed, crushed, yelled at and eventually screened 2 1/2 hours later. Terrible conditions, no signs, or English explanations. Half of our day wasted. The only positive was, the City wasn't crowded as it had been in the past. But we were tired and disappointed. We would have left, but there was no exit from the mass of people, crying children, and no bathrooms. Horrible setup for a world famous landmark such as this. Shame on you, China!"
"start from Tiananmen square and consider a ""private day tour"" ($200 AU each) from a reputable company such as Buffalo tours ....my wife and I had our own guide who knew how to ""weave"" through the crowds and kept us safe and also took us at our own pace... yes a long walk but a stress free and relaxing experience... our tour also included lunch and out to the great wall and back to our hotel ... again, all at our pace ."
"This is place where you may learn a lot from chinese culture and the old emperor day's life style.

It's a huge site so needs to walk alot. Not suiteable for small children, old people, wheelchairs."
"Visitors are not fair and honest. They are describing just the architecture and decoration and they don’t warn future visitors enough. Visit of the Forbidden City is an organized confusion. You need a lot of time to go through several checking points. It is good that special personnel and police in black uniforms and soldiers care for security. On the other hand they don’t care for visitors at all. Where there is enough space, they can walk around (bridges, squares and other open spaces). On the other hand they don’t care for the quality of visit. At each palace in the middle crowd is pushing left and right, men and women, children and old people. They are all just a mass without any pride or space. It is understandable that palaces of Harmony are closed to protect them. But simple rows, organized with ropes or low railings can be helpful. They have them in Tien an Men, but not here. No guards, no police, just crowd of Chinese and foreigners. It is heaven just for pickpockets. Organized parking for taxis or buses? Another utopia. Unesco experts, where are you? You need to suggest limited number of visitors or any other solution for this excellent monument."
Great to see and take a walk around but be careful there are a lot of scam taxi's around who don't switch meter on and charge you a lot.
Great experience and plenty to see and to indulge in the history and culture of ancient China.Can be very overcrowded in peak season but worth it.It would be advisable to be accompanied by a guide.
Didn't realize it was quite so big. Seemed to go on forever and although very interesting there was a lot of walking and not much shade. Very ht day when we were there. Glad we went.
"Huge place!! Tired legs! :)

Part of the palace is restored.

Be prepared that no taxi will be available at the exit of visit"
"Pretty interesting and cheap place to visit, either ¥40-60 depending on the season. It was a shame that you can't go inside the main buildings - instead you'll just have to scramble among the other tourists for a quick view of the Emperor's different rooms. Not much shade anywhere, definitely wear sunnies, hat and sunscreen - don't be dumb like I was. We thought the English audio tour was worth the ¥40 spent.

Very important: Be sure to start at Tian'amen Square and enter from the most Southerly security checkpoint of the Square - the lines for the others will likely be huge. If you're planning to visit the People's Heroes Monument and/or the National Museum - Be sure to visit them first! Once you enter the first temple gate (directly North of Tian'amen Square), the only way back is through the East gate and through the Worker's Palace, which costs ¥5 /person."
"We were here on labour weekend so we had anticipated The crowds (something like 80,000 that day). As a consequence it was to be expected that we had to push our way around and find space.

For me the city itself is magnificent, but the exhibitions (when we could get close) were dated in style, despite English explanations, so unless you understood the real detail of the history they added little.

In the end we just wandered around happily enjoying the atmosphere and having our photo taken by the Chinese tourists from outside Beijing who clearly didn't know we were not very attractive Westerners....or perhaps he did and will use the photos to frighten the kids at home."
I was very excited to visit this place but was disappointed. It might have been because of the enormous crowds but I really couldn't see much and each area was the same. The painting on the buildings was beautiful and I guess it would have been incredible without the crowds but of course it is a fabulous tourist attraction.
"If you want to visit this place get your best shoes and also arrange for a massage afterwards and if your bigman like me, celebrate because your definitely coming out slimer from the exit gate. The Chinese made it like maze just forgot to put enough exit gates. One freaking entry gate and one exit at the opposite ends of the city😋

The city is spread over 180 acres in the main center of Beijing and has close to a 1000 structures. It's grand and shows the power of the Chinese civilisation. However, the most impressive thing about this palace is the way these structures have stood the test of time. It's like the guys in 1400's knew that they are going to use it for another 1000 years. I have visited some south Asian countries and seen the structures are mostly in bad condition. This compound had emperor's till the good part of 1920's. That's 500 years. While I was there I read that even the tiles were prepared by a special process, using special clay and then heating them. Trust me when I say this, the ones inside were shining. It's next level beautiful and maintained"
"You can not visit Beijing without visiting the Forbidden City. Too see first hand how the emporer lived, brings history alive."
Very interesting visit here. Lots of walking. The painting on the buildings was vibrant and beautiful. Our guide explained the history of these building. There is lots of walking and lots of stairs. The wives/ enclosure was the most interesting as it had a feeling of having been lived in. The garden at the back was nice with peonys and trees that were hundreds of years old. There is a very large moat around the outside and a nice walkway at the back of forbidden city. Quite impressive.
Extremely busy had to queue for a bit to get tickets and you need to show your passport. Complex is huge so be prepared for a lot of walking. We got there about midday so lots of tour groups we however saw what we needed despite the crowds.
"We were part of a tour group to China with Sinaroma. From Tiananman Square to the end of the Forbidden City was a 4 mile walk for those who walked it. I opted for a wheelchair and a pusher(about $60 US). The good news, I didn't walk that distance, which was up and down several stairs or ramps, the bad news was I missed much of the tour guide's presentation. We didn't visit any rooms, see any artifacts, just in and out of one building after another. Nice to see and say I was there but that's it! If you can handle the walk, do it. If you're worried, hire a wheelchair and pusher."
"Not easy to view the interior of the buildings through doorways. Not much to see inside the various buildings anyway.
High area and very busy the afternoon we visited. I cannot say it was a ""not to be missed"" attraction"
Very impressive bulding complex. A must see in Peking. But it is very crowded especially during the national holidays.
The amazing thing about the Forbidden City is it's size!!! And it's right smack in middle of the city. Hints- *go early in the day * go on a week day* take your passport ( you won't get in without it) and if you are over 60 they give you a discount* make sure to enter from the bottom entrance. Entry 60 yuan (30 for seniors). Don't be deterred by the line it moves quickly and is very organises.
I went early 8am on a public holiday to see Tiananmen Square and forbidden city. It was awful with thousands of tourists pushing their way through to get a small bit of shade and take photos. I'm sure the place would be wonderful when it's quite or has no one there but my experience did not leave a nice memory.
"Excellent visit, you can learn about the Chinese dynasty and take naive pictures. Have to be all day to visit all."
Row after row of sacred photos and historical data. It is a must see along with the other standard must see items when in Beijing
"You need hours to fully take in and appreciate this amazing complex. Given the history of the building, best to read up on the complex before you go, this will make your tour much much richer. While you can go on your own, likely time better spent if you get a really good guide. Good luck getting pictures without other tourists in it, completely understandable why this site is so busy, it's pretty amazing."
"Went early and were passed through security quickly, hardly anyone in the queue to buy tickets so by 9:00am we were inside the gates. We stayed for seven hours - but then we do like to take photos and study the items that interest us. Hired two audio guides - both of which worked only for the introduction and no money back so that was a complete waste. Thought at first we were going to be disappointed as you can only look inside the main central palaces from the doorways, and although there weren't a lot of people everyone who was there seemed to congregate in this doorways so we gave up on that. But it is the outer buildings that hold the real interest, especially the West Palaces. We also visited the treasures exhibit and the ceramics. Quite a lot of the East Palaces were closed so after a while we gave up on that, and were pretty footsore by this time anyway. Don't miss the Treasures exhibit. If you have the strength and a few yen left over, when you exit take the underpass to the left and enter the park across the road to climb to the pagoda on the hill for good views over the Forbidden City. Also, if you are in Beijing any time soon (April-early May) the flowers iare amazing."
"Actually the ticket lady was prepared to take a photo id - but I would recommend remembering to take your passport.

Depending on what time of day the line up for security maybe long or short - that before you get into the Forbidden city. It does allow you to make a detour to Tiananmen Square what is on the opposite side of the main road to the city.

When you get in don't forget that there is more to the city then just the main building straight ahead. Above the Meridian Gate there is an exhibition hall which you get to by turning a sharp left or right and then walking up stairs to the top - great view and you can also walk along part of the wall surrounding the city. When we ere there they had an exhibition of jewels from around the world.

Getting away from the centre of the complex which can end up being a little like a centipede of humans, given the amount of large tours going through. This gave a break break from the crowds, but also give you a better understanding of the magnitude of this complex in the middle of Beijing. It can be a bit daunting if you want to get to see into the main halls of the city as the crowds can be somewhat unforgiving - be prepared to be jostled.

There are also Zhongshan Park to the left before you get to the Meridian Gate, which in spring were glorious - at the time we sent tulips were our in bloom as were some cherry blossoms, It is a small extra charge to get in see this - Not to be confused with the Imperial Gardens within the walls of the city.

Four Fun Facts - This was the political centre of China for 500 years
- It is largest collection of preserved ancient wooden structures in the
world
- Touch the gold knobs on the red doors to the forbidden city for good l
luck
- some of the pine trees in the Imperial Gardens are over 400 years old

"We only could visit on a Saturday due to our itinerary and my goodness it was busy, after all they only let 80,000 visitors in a day!! People everywhere and very difficult to see things, such a shame as it was an amazing experience. My advice would be to go as early in the day as you can!"
"There were many people at the Forbidden City the day we were there. You need to allocate plenty of time due the the crowds, again it is better to pre book to make sure you don't miss out. Beware of the pushing and shoving, you need to stand your ground or you won't get anywhere fast. Our tour guide was great and took us away through some back alley ways to get away from the crowds."
"You could spend easily weeks here as the palace is absolutely massive. This is a must see when visiting Beijing. Be prepared for long lines and many security checkpoints throughout your visit.

There are many gates throughout the Palace. Each gate has a throne from a different era. There is so much to see from paintings, tapestries, ceramics and many more. There is a self guide tour you can take with audio recordings in many languages for a nominal fee, well worth the price to explain all the history and heritage of this site. In order to completely take in everything, you would need days if not weeks to see everything. The major highlights of the throne rooms/gates can be done in a few hours. Make sure you are wearing comfortable walking shoes, as the palace is absolutely massive.

You will need your passport entering the Forbidden Palace to present it to the ticket office in order to visit this stunning beautiful site."
This place is big has lots of history but it's kind of run down and not really impressive compared to other palaces in the world. They need to take more care of their monuments. Wouldn't go back and wouldn't recommend.
"2nd time and it was so much better exploring on our own. The group tours with thousands of people are all pushing up the center of the palace and don't take the time to explore the wings with the royal residences. Give yourself 5 or 6 hours and go on your own (with your passport), buy the audio tour, and be sure to escape the melee and see the real palace."
Incredible structures and the historical significance and life stories that are hidden within these walls are countless. You could literally spend weeks exploring this city.
"What a place to visit, especially when you have read up about the history of the palace.

The size and scale of the palace is just mind blowing.

A must visit.

Do go after lunch to avoid the crowd."
Our guide was wonderful and very informative! Wonderful history and amazing to see. A must see when in Beijing!
"Wow...So much history, temples, garden, forecourts...Large crowds - easy to get lost in the push of the crowd. But still worth the walk. You need to have water and be willingly to walk for hours."
"The Forbidden Palace entrance is located across from Tiananmen Square and appears to be a complex of courtyards getting smaller and smaller as you wander from one to another and end up in the middle where the most important building is located.

Various throne rooms and bed chambers abound. It is worth taking the audio tour as this connects automatically at set location. The ticket office is located in the first courtyard to the left and you (as a foreigner) are required to present individual passport or ID card to purchase a tickets.

It is fascinating to see that the Chinese are still immensely proud of their history and marvel at it's splendour.

Well worth a few hours of your time to marvel in history"
"Bring your passport and be prepared to cattle-shoot your way to the entrance through security, but it is very worth the amazing experience of seeing this historic sight. Gorgeous gardens and lovely temples. People push and shove and it would seem there would be a more civilized way to see things yet this is the way, thankfully only at times. You can get an ice cream far inside for a nice break and they are very reasonably priced. GET the self tour unit to understand better what you are seeing."
How lucky the Chinese people are that the military bravely defended the defining piece of Chinese culture during the revolution. Writing a review about this special place seems like it would not do it justice. You'll just have to visit for yourself and experience for yourself!
We came here with our tour guide and I was just blown away at the size of it! Very impressed with the lovely flowers all around the square. A must see if you visit Beijing!
"Great experience to go back in history and see how the Emperors lived centuries ago, where the public was not even allowed to see the Forbidden City. Beautiful buildings spread out in a huge sprawling area with one courtyard after another. The concubine residence is extremely interesting. If you cannot visit this palace see the movie ""the Last Emperor"" which will give you an idea of the emperors' life style.
Plan on spending a few hours in this complex require a lot of walking."
You really need a lot of time to visit this place it's a very large growed tourist place and fortunatly we had access to entery a lot easier than the locals. Over the hill opulance and grand to say the least. Well worht the effort
"Well maintained, and neat. Guides are available or you can hire a audio guide which will narrate ( headphone). If you dont prefer a guide, you can just walk around and read the boards kept in front of the attractions. Please note the opening and closing timing before you plan the trip. Parking is a concern, but it is not so if you are on a taxi."
"It's not just one palace. It goes on and on. One built right behind the other. Hopefully you get a tour guide that speaks english well so you can understand all the great history and stories. We went first thing in the morning and it was crowded, but our guide said it was actually a ""light"" day. Go figure. Be prepared to push your way around to get a glimpse of the more popular sights. But no need to be rude."
"There is a lot of walking! I had thought you would be able to enter the buildings, but you cannot. Of course there were hoards of people pushing and shoving around the openings to the buildings where you could look into the building. Still worth going to see; just not quite as I thought it would be. It is beautiful to see; we were with a tour group, so our tour leader gave us the talk about it. We had also watched the movie ""The Last Emperor"" before we went; this made it much more interesting."
"The total vastness of this place will blow your mind, it is huge. Prepare for lots of walking and take water with you. It can be busy and a real scrum to get a front row picture in each palace but it's worth it. The gift shop is also a cafe and quite cheap with some nice things in it. As you walk through each section it gets more spectacular, it also feels calm even though you are in the centre of Beijing. This is a must see place."
"Beautiful and amazing place where the Emperor lived. I would recommend to do a tour, you can book it at your hotel. By doing it with a tour guide, you avoid queues. It's a very popular place full of tourists."
"It is a big complex and though the architecture is beautiful and I understand it was declared a World Heritage Site, so It is one of the main attractions in Beijing. But in my opinion It's more of admiring Chinese architecture more than a tourist attraction per se. It is worth the visit though."
"It was with great regret we didn't manage to go inside the Forbidden City. The queues were unbelievably long. We didn't have much time as we had another destinations to go.

Our tour guide told us the story of how the Forbidden City was built and who lived there. It was very fascinating to hear how the life was back in the old days.

If you're really want to go inside, make sure you come veryyy early in the morning to avoid the long queue or else you'll end up like me.

But hey, we took picture in front of the gate!"
It's hard to imagine but there are 9999 rooms in the forbidden city and chairman Mao never visited the city; his Feng Sheu master told him not too
This is a must-see because of the history. The buildings are very well preserved. The grounds are enormous so be prepared for a lot of walking. It is also wide open except for the gardens at the rear of the complex so be sure to wear a hat to protect yourself from the sun.
"The museum is awesome. We wanted to get dress up photos and of course they sell you a photo package where you get a DVD of you flying all of Beijing. I come home and the photos are blurry and the DVD is just music. Sad!!!
I just want to warn other people to not get caught up in the photos and NOT buy anything. Had this done 10 years ago, so I was sentimental and wanted a new photo of my not so little kids as kings and princesses."
"Long cue to enter the city, very crowded, lots of halls which yo can not enter but just having a look from entrance door."
"The Forbidden City is a ""must see"" for anyone visiting Beijing. But be prepared for crowds. We were there in ""Golden Week"" and have never seen so many people in one place! Having said that others have told us that they have been there and the place was almost deserted!"
Got to worth the visit but be warned this place can be very busy. Take the camera. I did this trip with a guide and I think thats the best way to see everything.
"Our guide Lotus really helped with this tour explaining the various stages of the Palace.

Without meaning to be disrespectful, I am glad I have done it but it was not a pleasant experience. There are just too many people and when you need to view an item or room it creates a bottleneck of people and it can get intimidating. But I must stress I never felt threatened, I must admit my wife battled with the masses. I do understand that I was a guest and that it was not my heritage so my perspective was vastly different.

Be prepared to walk between 7000 - 10 000 steps if you include Tiananmen Square as well."
"The Forbidden City was the Chinese imperial palace around five centuries. They started the construction under the Ming dynasty in the early 1400. The last emperor who lived in the palace was Puyi (he became emperor when he was two years), from 1908 until his abdication in 1912.

You need to spend time to visit this complex, it's enormous. The arcitecture is great and I recommend that you read about the Forbidden city before yoy visit it. You have to know a little bit of the great history. Wonderful, a must-see."
"It's like one big courtyard but multiplied. A lot uf space where, apart from buildings, you can see simply nothing. Well, maybe like 10 the same golden thrones... And, for Chinese standards, it's expensive. And price doesn't meet the quality. If you have better things to do, chose them over the forbidden city."
"The forbidden city use to be where only the emperor lived and all the servants that attended to his wishes , once the communist party came to power they closed the place but now day it is permitted for tourists to visit"
"Very impressive, it is a large place with a lot of temples and places to wander around. Avoid the main stream of tourists by going left or right."
I went with a small group tour to the Forbidden City. I don't usually like guided tours but it seemed the easiest way to visit. There are long lines for tickets but the guide had been able to pre book. It's an interesting place and the painting and detail around the eaves of the buildings is remarkable. Lots of the buildings are closed and most that are open are empty. A lot of walking but a must see when in Beijing.
"A little disappointing and extremely crowded, even outside peak tourist travel times. The history is fascinating but the hoards of mainly Chinese tourists and lack of english speaking personnel made the buying of tickets pretty frustrating. Very difficult to see the various buildings due to crowds."
"Recently visited the Forbidden City twice while on holiday in Beijing. This is an amazing place to visit, one I've wanted to see since childhood. So for me it was a dream come true. Our 1st visit was part of a tour, we went early in the morning and the crowds were unbelievable with a lot of pushing and shoving but it was still very surreal to finally set foot in the Forbidden City. Our 2nd visit the next day was a bit later approximately 11:30 and was completely different. Gone were the early morning crowds and we had more time and space to explore this amazing place. This is a must see while in Beijing just avoid the early morning crowds and go a bit later."
Very impressive Palace. Can't remember how much it was to get in but I'm sure it was fairly cheap. You can take as long as you like to walk around & see as much or as little as you like. You must enter through a security check at any side (can go through Tiananmen Square). Enter under the painting of Chairman Mao (not very well sign posted). There are large queues but they go down quick. When you exit out of the other side there are two nice parks to walk around (the Jushan(?) park straight ahead has a pagoda on the hill with great views back down to the palace & over the city.)
"When entering the first building in the Forbidden City, I was thinking this was a very special place, but it was just the start.

Allow plenty of time to see this attraction and make sure you have a local guide so you get the whole back story"
"This is my second visit but my first in peak Spring tourist season. Be prepared for crowds of tourist groups, mostly Chinese. Even though lots of people it was still easy to get around. Difficult to see inside the rooms though due to number of people. We went early in the morning this time but last time went later in afternoon, not sure if that makes a difference. You will need ID to get tickets on site e.g. Passport. Both visits took around 2 hours. A lot of the side rooms were closed this time which was disappointing. This is an excellent site and located right near Tiananmen so take the day and visit central Beijing including the gates at the bottom of the square."
"One of the least visited places inside the city is a must see clock museum. The last emperor was a clock enthusiast. Kings and heads of countries would have a special clock made for the emperor, by their best clock makers, as a way to buy favors. The clocks range in all sizes, shapes, and do many different things"
"Palace complex is huge and full of various things to see and explore! Only as it is also supper busy with local travelers and also foreign guests. Best way to explore the palace complex is to go around with local guide, who can tell the story behind each building and history.

I don't know, which would be the best time to visit, while it is always is busy and buzzing like a huge bee house!"
"A very stunning piece of Chinese architecture and history and I learnt a lot. However, it was super crowded and the security was very strict and a bit ... there was a long queue due to the security reasons and it was a one-way path to the palace."
A must see! Also houses the Dragon Lady's House. Appeared to be the oldest section of the Forbidden City.
"The idea that this place held such an awesome part of Chinese history between its walls is amazing. Moving through it just fills you with awe and wonder.
Make sure you go to the toilet before you come here though....seriously gross and tarnished the experience a little.
Don't forget to take photo id."
"It is a must-visit landmark in Beijing. Come early as you have to queue to enter the Tian'anmen square. The massive structure of the gates, the many halls and the palace garden will take you to the ancient China."
"Fascinating tour that provides glimpses and narratives of the lives of the emperors who rules China. We rented the audio guide (GPS enabled audio device) from the entrance, and toured about 60% of the forbidden city in 4 hours."
"If you dont like crowds dont go. It is always busy, particularly on weekends and public holidays. The Chinese dont understand queuing and will push and shove to get through."
"This place is worth visiting. The Forbidden City is the largest and best-preserved imperial palace area in the world. However, prepare to queue."
"The huge numbers of tourists visiting the Forbidden city is staggering and it was very helpful to visit with a private guide who could show us around.
Essentially you filter through the North Gate of the Forbidden City off Tianamen Square (easy to combine visits to both at the same time) and walk, along the North South line to the South Gate of the Forbidden city.

Along the way are ever more spectacular temples, all perched on small hills overlooking huge courtyards where visitors would kneel before the emperor.

A guide is essential if you want to gain an understanding of Chinese culture and historical beliefs. The Forbidden City highlights how much power the Emperor of China has over his people, as well as how he conducted his personal life in times of multiple wives and concubines, all of which lived in the city and were forbidden to leave.

Well worth a visit. The teens weren't as fascinated by the history as we would have liked, but enjoyed the opportunity to get dressed up in emperor clothes and be silly at the end."
"The Forbidden City is a massive place and it is so huge, truly amazing. The old time architecture and the history of the palace are amazing.Must visit here when come to Beijing."
"The palace is really huge and able to accommodate huge crowds. Many places were closed during our visit, therefore not much sites and things to see except the abandoned emperor chairs. The backyard garden supposed to be beautiful but too many crowds, unable to take proper photo there."
"If you leave Beijing without seeing this, you will need to return. Plan to spend at least 4 hours to guilt enjoy the architecture and grounds."
"You MUST take your passport to visit this attraction otherwise you will not be given a ticket. Rooms are blocked off and trying to see through the small doorways with so many people pushing and shoving is not fun. You enter through 1 gate and exit out the next, regimented walking direction, very little actually open. Would not be in a hurry to return and expensive."
"I would definitely recommend getting guide for this part of your Beijing trip even if you don't want one for the rest of it. The Forbidden City is huge and having a knowledgeable guide will surely enhance your experience. We had lots of crowds when we visited which is to be expected in China. It was interesting to see the buildings but I wish some of it was used to show how they lived as well with furnishings and things so I could relate to the uses of the buildings more easily. It was a cool part of our trip, but not our favorite."
"Great tour. Forbidden city and the square are something to be seen and visited. Tour guide was wonderful

History - Forbidden City, also known as the Palace Museum, and Gu Gong in Chinese, lies at the city center of Beijing, and once served as the imperial palace for 24 emperors during the Ming and Qing Dynasties (1368 - 1911). It was first built throughout 14 years during the reign of Emperor Chengzu in the Ming Dynasty (1368-1644)."
"Starting by walking past the portrait of Mao, the Forbidden City thrills you with sights through every gate you pass through. The area is awe inspiring and so is the architecture and history. The scope, the scale is so great. This is an amazing place to take pictures, but be aware of your surroundings as it is very crowded. I chose not to look inside a few of the buildings just to avoid the crowds. It's a necessary evil of a place like this though. I recommend using a guide so that your tickets will be taken care of and you always make sure you're in the correct line.
Visiting The Forbidden City is a truly amazing experience that i won't soon forget."
"It's huge. The smallest part is bigger than anything you'd expect.

9999 rooms, go count. It's the biggest palace in the world and most visited. Much history and tragedy and all in view."
"Very impressed with the forbidden city and the history behind it. I went there with a tour guide, he gave me PLENTY of information about the place I loved it so much"
"Well the children loved the disney movie Mulan and they were not exaggerating when they drew this cartoon. It is huge and deserves the title 'City'. The carvings, the ceiling heights, the colours, the meaning behind it all, amazing and gives you a respect for chinese culture that you have never had until you see it. Go with a guide so you can skip the queue and get the most interesting taste. We did not but when we did for the Great Wall it made a big difference to our experience for the better. The hotel will book a good tour guide for you."
"This was our favorite site of Beijing. You could easily spend half a day here if you walk through everything. The compounds were all stunning and there was more than enough to see even with all the buildings that are closed. One thing I didn't realize when we were planning though, is that in order to see the Nine Screen Dragon Pavilion you had to pay extra. (and it is very hard to find the only reason I did was through research of where to turn at what point) That didn't matter though, as some of the best parts of the Palace were in that extra pay area. Must see for sure!"
"My husband took a nice, quiet, long walk to the forbidden city from the hotel (hotel is located in Dong Si) in the morning. We asked few local people for the direction and they were all very helpful. There was maintenance work going on for the front entrance of the forbidden city so we went in from the exit. It was ""quiet"" season but there were sooo many tourists there. My advice is to go there in winter.
The palace is so beautiful that you could almost feel how spectacular and powerful the empires were hundreds years ago. There were still many places within the forbidden city undergoing construction maintenance work, it was shame that we couldn't visit all the places inside."
"Very interesting history. Tour guide is recommended to get the history and reasoning for artefact, statues, and buildings."
Went there in the afternoon on Sunday as they are closed on Mondays. No queue to buy the ticket at the ticket booth but inside the museum it is quite crowded with local tourists from all over China. They do not provide free map so do print it out in advance or else you will end up paying for it. You will need at least 2 hours to enjoy this place so do plan ahead.
Not to miss when you are in China/Beijing! Try to go in the early morning as this is a very popular tourist spot.
"Buildings, architecture, art, rude and obnoxious Chinese tourists, it just has it all!

I don't understand the 'obsession' with seeing the emperors throne and pushing your way through to get a picture of it but I complied and did the same. Pushing through like a mad man, blending in with the locals. I don't want to seem out of place.

I was able to learn about Chinese history and local culture. I was able to witness how people can be so selfish, rude and uncaring to others. Be so self centred and uncivilized. Maybe there is no hope in humanity? But, I am now home in the comfort of Canada and I feel better. My hope is restored at least in this part of the world.

People aside, most of the place is restored and kept nicely but some of it is is a bit worn down and could use some TLC. The large open area in the centre is huge and a site to see. You will find art, traditional furniture, and nice intricate details in everything from the doors to the steps and the railing.

Get an audio tour guide, it'll help you understand the significance of places as you walk around. During our visit some of the points were closed off so we couldn't see the entire palace. Not sure when they open up the entire place or if they ever do.

The Palace is definitely a full day visit. There is a lot to see and a lot of walking. Lots of places to take great pictures as well."
"Entering the palace is like seeing the scenes in the Chinese dramas. Red doors, hallways, glimpses of the throne seat etc. It was quite crowded given that it was a Tuesday with no Chinese public holidays that week. Be prepared to push and be pushed by the crowd to view the throne seats. You will need all the crowd-pushing skills you can muster. Bringing a selfie stick may help you get the photo of the interior. However you may be unable to appreciate the setting by looking.

Entrance fee is rmb60. There are two special entrances on the east side (rmb10 each). Hall of Clocks and Treasure Galery (jewellery, painting). Enjoyed the former though not as much for the latter. Entrance fees are cheap. Might as well just go for both.

Most tourists go for the central sections of the palace (which takes 1.5 hour) however there are other sections of the palaces on the west and east that are interesting. The visit to the entire palace takes a full day. No food is sold within the compound.

Forbidden City is closed on every Monday except during public holidays and summer holidays (July-August)."
"Busy, packed with tourists, but so incredible. Be aware it's a long walk. 9 Palace gates and entrances. 9 separate buildings to explore. There is an exit at the end, you don't have to turn around to go back and out. If you are on a tour, you will learn about the dynasties, the colours, the mythical creatures that guard the entrances. Take water and a hat. Be aware that toilets are pit toilets and can get busy. Just go with the experience, don't try to rush, accept the crowd and it is very rewarding. At the end there will be a street peddler drawing a sketch of you on a plate, if you get to be the one he is sketching, remember you don't have to buy the plate! Walk away. Unless you are flattered and want to buy it."
"visited this place on a sunday and boy ive made a wrong decision. this place is packed with people. it seems like the whole city population of beijing is this place. but nonetheless, ive enjoy the history behind it."
"The Forbidden City is An amazing piece of China's ancient culture and fabric. We learned so much about their customs and why this city has its name. I was surprised by just how many people we had to struggle with to get a good view (something we are finding across all of China). Unlike other parts of Asia, You are unable to enter any of the palaces or buildings here and it is quite dark. All of this makes it difficult to see what you came to see! The outside gardens were amazing - we spent more time walking areas that weren't as popular with the Chinese tourists. While worth visiting, be prepared to be jostled by the crowd and have to struggle to get a good picture. Spend time just walking the grounds and finding your own favorite views"
"Another lovely attraction that made our stay enjoyable. The history and views of this place are breathtaking. I would loved to have stayed for three hours and completed a proper tour but this wasn't warranted for us with three young children,.
We completed a walk of the grounds, showed the children the main buildings whilst they pretended to be interested and moved on. Definitely a worthy visit, I loved it and would have loved more time here. Buy tickets beforehand- fairly inexpensive,- and away you go. We found that in Beijing generally people didn't speak much English (which of course is to be expected / accepted but can make life difficult) and there is no guessing the writing etc otherwise. We didn't do a tour Because the children wouldn't have coped in the heat but probably this would be the best option if we went again. Loved this place, recommended a visit for first timers."
"Very beautiful and impressive structures. Recommend getting a guide for a small group rather than going in a big group. Otherwise you will just be going in one big intense queue from start to finish together with 18 000 others. We were planning to go by ourselves, but got hooked in by a guide. did not regret it, i don´t think it would have given me anything other than a heart attack if we did not have a guide to tell us about the palace. Cost is about 60 yuan per person to get inside, get there early, they only sell a fixed amount of tickets per day. If you include the garden, it should take about 2 hours to finish the whole thing. If you love tea, visit the tea house in the outer garden to learn how to make tea and buy high quality products. They also have the government centre for studies of chinese medicine there. It is possible to get a consultation and treatment for only 20 yuan."
"My family booked a tour with a private guide on a Tuesday and arrived there at opening time. I thought that going early in the morning would lessen the crowds, but that was not to be the case. There was truly an unbelievable amount of people at the Forbidden City at that hour (perhaps because a ton of tourists had just watched the flag-raising ceremony at Tianamen square? or because Forbidden City had been closed on Monday?). It felt like Walmart on Black Friday when the doors open. I'm not entirely sure what would have made the situation better, but my guess is that it may be slightly less crazy going at other times of the day, like several hours before closing or around 1-2 pm, when the morning people are leaving."
"A 5 out of 5 stars. Wow. Just. Wow. If you are planning a trip Beijing, the Forbidden City and Tiananmen Square are both a must see and adjacent to each other. As the imperial palace of China from
The Ming to the Qing dynasties, Forbidden City is packed with spectacular history as well as full of breathtaking traditional Chinese designs. There is 500 years of Chinese history here so take your time here. The compound is incredibly expansive, so plan for a good 2 hour tour. Try to get there early to avoid the very long lines. Plus, in the summer, the temperature gets really hot so starting early makes for cooler touring climate."
"A truly wonderful insight into the history of the Emperors and their behaviours, ruling, passage over the Dynasty's etc.

Very crowded and noisy which seems to be the case everywhere in China."
"First time i see this ""Imperial Palace"" i was shocked by its name ""Forbidden City"". Now it renamed Palace Museum with wonderful old buildings. The throne is in the middle of the palace, but ordinary tourist cannot get in for security reason, we only see it from outside (so sad ). I recommend to come there at weekdays, because there's less peoples there."
"This is another great experience when in Beijing but make sure you have time and a guide. There is so much to see so take your time and plan your day, the beauty is in the little things enjoy the walk and the great experience."
"We went into the Forbidden City after crossing Tainanmen Square. We did not realize until we were there, how close the two were, and how big the Forbidden City itself is. both mini revelations. The architecture of the buildings inside the city was interesting, but the sheer size was surprising. Our guide kept saying ""there is much more to go."" There is much to see and enjoy as well, but ultimately, we did get to the other side."
"You can't miss out on ticking this off your list of places to visit during a stay in Beijing - it is absolutely massive with plenty of points of interest, overlooked by the gardens from which the view at the top is truly memorable...."
Arrived 8am on a Saturday to find the approaching courtyards already heaving with people. I really wanted to see this and it really is breathtaking in its scale and beauty. However we were often left wondering in awe at the size of the crowds as much as the impressive Halls. You need time and patience to appreciate this - but that is hard in such a populous experience. If my work schedule had allowed we would have gone mid-week and thus avoided sharing the experience with the thronging crowds.
"i'v been there already twice , its really nice because its like a park and you learn alot . i recomend to pay for the privat headphones with the explanations in english .
the entrance fee costs 40 yuan or 20 for students.
after it you have a bus to go back because the exit is in a different place but you can also try to walk back by yourself , its nice if the weather is good ."
Tiananmen Square go through the gate near the East Gate to bypass the frontline and just hit up the Palace museum ticket booth. It was too many people there and especially locals. Interesting walk with guide which we found inside
"We managed to be visiting here when it was 1deg at the end of March, it's an amazing site and the craftsman ship is spectacular, would be easy to get lost in some areas, so keep track of where you are. Lots of people"
"Came here with a private guide and avoided all the long queues. Look for my previous review for China Sunny Tour.
This is a place you will need guide and more time to understand the history. A place where you can take alot of nice and interesting photos. However we couldn't do so cause kids were with us. Will come back again!"
A lot to see so plan on several hour tour. Lots of walking at a leisure pace. Take an umbrella for rain or sun. Take a guided tour to avoid the long wait in line to get tickets. Also the guide will give you a better understanding and explanation of the palace/museum.
"It's a gigantic place, you should rent automatic guide ,it's cost 40rmb. Please avoid to visit 10.00-14.00,there are a lots of tourists."
"Again, the Chinese architecture is so beautiful. To realize that everything we see was (and is) so labor intensive. We experienced the architectural splendor of the palaces, ceremonial courtyards and private quarters."
Well worth a trip the Forbidden City - to see artifacts from so many years ago was amazing. A definite must see.
Interesting place. It was crowded of people. Go early in the morning to avoid spending most of the days waiting for tickets and security check.
"Althou the best art was taken to Taiwan, and some other items stolen by the western establishment some 100 years ago, this place boasts in fine chinese art. The is so much to see in the Forbidden palace, one whole day is really a good time frame. Make sure you read a little history before you get here, just so you are not so bered otherwise."
"The Forbidden City was spectacular and huge. Requires a great deal of walking to see very much. One courtyard after another keep coming and coming. While their we visited the clock collection, which was fabulous, and the relics museum that has a 400 or so of their million antiques they have stored. Be prepared to spend a few hours to see very much. They let in 80,000 visitors a day, so be prepared for some crowds too. Worth a visit when in Beijing just bring comfortable shoes!"
"The Forbidden City is plainly an amazing place to visit and see. It was completed in 1420, but was not open to visitors until 1949. So, commoners, consider yourselves lucky to get the chance to see the place. There are too many gates and halls to mention, but the city is filled with grandeur and excess. The huge bronze cauldrons you'll see scattered throughout the complex were used to hold water to fight fires. The city is probably the best example of Chinese Imperial architecture you will see in China, so this is a must see."
"The place was crowded, but it was worth it. Go with plenty of time because the place is bigger than you think, it is called a city for a reason :).
And if you have time after go to the temple behind the city to get the view of the whole forbidden city from the top"
This place is filled with history. You can easily spend a couple of hours here. There is a lot of walking with a few stairs. Make sure you walk to the top of one of the buildings to get a great view.
"In Beijing it is imperative to visit Forbidden city... Do so with a knowledgable guide since there is just too much to see but you need someone to tell you the what is what... once you cross the Gate of heavenly peace there are buildings after buildings (palaces)... some have emperor's throne some are for Queens and some are the bedrooms for emperor or concubines... Its on a straight line and you are walking through one section after another... Its a journey through the culture and architecture of ancient China... The royal life style and their insistence of showing themselves as God's representatives (The palace is thought to be the replica of God's palace in Heaven)... there are many Halls and each hall has it's significance and if your guide is good then they can point out difference in architecture of buildings built in different periods.

Pack some food water since its a ling walk."
"A definite must-see tourist attraction, based around an amazing historical venue.

Logistics here are well managed although it can get extremely busy and you will get nudged and bumped when trying to take pictures of some of the interesting rooms - it is just the way here, so be prepared.

Very much enjoyed and would possibly visit again as it is just so amazing to wander around and take in the sights."
"Fantastic city in the middle of Beijing. Don't miss to visit this place during visit Beijing
The building belongs to 600 years ago or more and show the excellent civilization."
"Oh my what to write, just go visit and enjoy!

The compound is crowded but large so it won't hinders you, just walk around and mesmiraze about the Imperial past"
"Closed on Mondays except national holidays. We visited on a busy day to find a long queue at the south entrance. Take the side street on the eastern side and you can get into the ticket area much easier.
We paid 200CNY for a personal guide, plus her entrance fee, who approached us at the queue for tickets. Make sure they are licensed to take you around, if they agree to a lower price they are probably not. Belinda was very knowledgeable and managed to get us around the important parts in a couple of hours. Well worth it and if you consider the total cost for two was about £20 each that's good value in comparison to iconic tourist attractions elsewhere.
You can go across the road at the north exit and for an extra few CNY go into the Garden of the Heavenly Dwelling, there is a tea house at the top were they give you samples of various teas and explain in English all about them for about 30 minutes. No charge for the samples but we felt we had to buy some tea, small jars were about £8 each.
Climb up to the temple for a great view of Beijing and especially the Forbidden City to get an idea of the scale."
"This is one of the highlights of a China tour, right up there with the Great Wall and the Terra Cotta Warriors. There is a heavy military and police presence guarding the site, especially on the outside. Be prepared to do a LOT of walking. This place is massive! It is very beautiful with intricate detail, and such a sense of history. This is most definitely a must see."
"Very interesting and links well with visit to Tiananmen Square. We had our own guide which does not cost a lot, who was very informative allowing us the opportunity to make most of our visit. Visited out of season and although cold we were able to walk freely making for pleasant day"
"It is a very good attraction however there can be a lot of people making it very crowded, but it was a one off experience."
"Be sure to spend the extra 40 RMB on an audioguide

And go to the park at the back for a bird's eye view"
"We loved this palace!
It's beautiful, big, surprising, ... just amazing place to roam around.
It's extremely crowded and you'll have difficulties to find a quiet place or to be alone on the photo.
You can spend hours there, without being bored or getting twice to the same part of the palace.
Make sure you visit the garden as well.
If you are well prepared, you can do it in your own, no need to take a guide."
"The place was a bit crowded even during a working day, but no wonder why so many want to see it. It’s overwhelming to be able to take a walk around and imagine the emperors and people living there at their time.

I regret not having a well-informed tour guide with me. I would have been even better experience to have someone telling the stories while walking between the specific sites."
"The place is huge and still very crowded by tourists, even in a rainy day.
One cannot walk this place without imagining how life was here in its period of glory and bloom. In a 2h30 – 3h visit we can only quickly see some of the pavilions and main buildings, repetitive at some point but still impressive. I will have this image in my mind from now on when I will read books about this place and historical period."
"There is such a rich history contained within the walls of the Forbidden City, once the Imperial Palace. After a while, however, one impressive building begins to look like another impressive building. The story of the man-made river that runs through the city was interesting as it became a natural way for water to flow out of the palace to the natural outlets"
This was a great site to visit and so happy we made this choice. We were able to spend 2 hours and 30 mins which was the perfect amount of time to see everything.
"Visited the forbidden palace with my family and although it was crowded and a bit repetitive, we thought it was a very unique and historical place.

Pros:
- the different type of gates and buildings are really solemn and epic.
- although ultra crowded, the place was well organized so there wasn't much waiting around.
- great spot for photos.
- they lend you, free of charge, an audio guide in most languages.

Cons:
- can get a bit repetitive towards the end north entrance (we aren't ultra fans of monuments).
- full of people"
See this and understand the power of the Chinese empire(s). Avoid group tours and go at your own pace. worth every minute.
"As I went with a tour group, I was unable to float around at my own pace. The ""city"" is huge with various temples, residences, gardens, and every other thing an emperor could want. The buildings are open, but you aren't allowed to enter. It is not handicapped accessible, as most of the buildings are at the top of a bank of steps. On the positive side, it is clean and well maintained."
"We were on a tour and had about 2 hours to visit. The guide lead us in a more or less straight path through the city seeing residential and temple spaces but I feel that we saw a good example of everything on offer. the roof treatments were the most interesting item to me. The colours were fantastic. The outside roof treatment with a series of animals at each corner were also of great interest. Most of the rooms do not have furniture, or very little, so it is not like going through a European palace that often has a lot. Here the architecture, the walls and especially the ceiling and roof
are the attraction.
Access could be an issue, while there are ramps in many locations , and persons in wheelchairs do go in, the outside ground is cobble stones and difficult to walk on."
Easy metro ride from our hotel. We had been here before so we explored the Treasury and other sights on the left and right sides. Treasury costs an extra 10 rmb and is less crowded. There is a sit down restaurant (with beer and gelato) in the middle. Order and pay at counter. I recommend the audio guide in English that activated by gsp.
"Worth visiting with a tour guide to understand what the forbidden city / emperor time is about.
There are alot of tourists when you first go into the forbidden city, but if you veer off to the left or right you will be sure to find a place with only a few people there.
We were surprised at how big the place is! It's worth a visit"
"Far to many tourist, but an interesting place to visit. The complex is huge, so if you have mobility issues not really a good place to walk around for long hours. There are wheelchair ramps. This is said to be the world's largest palace complex and covers 74 hectares. Surrounded by a 52-meter-wide moat and a 10-meter-high wall are more than 8,700 rooms. The museum carries out a south-to-north unidirectional itinerary. Visitors can only enter through the Meridian Gate (Wumen) and leave from the Gate of Divine Prowess (Shenwumen) or East Prosperity Gate (Donghuamen). Three to four hours is enough for touring the central axis; if you have interest in exploring more about the imperial palace, more time need to be spent in the west and east wings. So, basically you could spend all day here after stopping for pictures in Tiananmen Square."
"A must see to any visit to Beijing
Very crowded on the day we were there
Once again would probably need a half a day to explore it properly but worth while even for a quick visit"
I recommend you read the history or watch the movie then when you visit you will appreciate the visit. I would also recommend to hire one of the students who will be your tour guide and will not break the bank.
"It is very crowded, but a must see. We went with a tour group that makes it much easier to get through and you get some history. Earlier you go the better."
"Get there early, there can be very long lines. We went with a tour, maybe 25 tourists, and were unable to purchase advance tickets. There is an entrance fee. The Forbidden City is a large area made up of several palaces and buildings. There’s a lot to see and without a good guide book and/or tour guide to explain what you’re seeing, you could miss a lot. Plan to stay at least two to three hours at the minimum. It’s located by the Mausoleum of Mao Zedong and Tiananmen Square."
China has done an unbelievable job of maintaining this great historical monument. It is a beautiful attraction with much to see. I would recommend getting there early as there are long lines especially in the high tourist season.
"We visited with a guide and would recommend to get the most out of your time here, allow half a day at least."
"Don't skip it, just decide to go on the path less traveled.

We heard so much about crowds, heat and lines that we made good use of our jet lag to be in line just at opening time. We zoomed in, joined the mosh pit of tiny Chinese old ladies and got a peek at the throne room before heading directly for the west edge where we found many unoccupied plazas that were cool and peaceful. We had them almost entirely to ourselves for an hour or so before the crowds started catching us in the Western Palaces.

Out this far there is an archeological site also, a well, a pretty little souvenir shop, etc.

The garden was such a crush we zipped through. We never saw all the souvenir sellers others complained about.

When the crowds started to build and the atmosphere became suffocating we ditched for a nap at the hotel and will go back to do the other edge of the Forbidden City on another day."
"We arrived at 7:45am at the Palace and there were already lots and lots of tour parties there. And the gates didn't open until 8:30am. This place is enormous with over 8,700 rooms and depicts the Ming dynasty's private lifestyle. Interestingly, there wasn't a lot of westerner tourists that we saw, but large local tour groups. The entry cost is $12 AUD and it pays to get there earlier to avoid the queues."
"We were with a tour group and were glad we had someone to tell us the history of the places we saw in Beijing. The Forbidden City was a highlight of our trip. So large, and so much history to see."
"It is not only a treasure trove for China but on human civilization of this world as we know it.

The amount of painstaking works the management team has put into restoration and engaging technology to display the artifacts to make it interesting has been well worthwhile. This is truly a world class museum comparable to the British Museum, Louvre and the Metropolitan!

A must see in Beijing and checkout their presentation on how they go about preserving finds."
"This city is MASSIVE and is excellently maintained by the Chinese government. Note that this place is LOADED with tourists from all across China so prepare to feel like you are a livestock, however, I thought it was a nice see and could be great in the evenings too as they light up the Forbidden City . ENJOY!"
"If you're heading to the Forbidden City get there early and be prepared for the crowds! They limit the visitor numbers to 80,000 per day. But it's a fantastic place to see and to take your time wandering around. In July it was too hot to spend all day there but I would have at another time of year."
Had a chance to visit this one afternoon and it was truly incredible. A definite must see if you visit Beijing.
"If Great Wall is the symbol of China, then for Beijing its the Forbidden City. Forbidden City, also known as the Palace Museum, and Gu Gong in Chinese, lies at the city center of Beijing, and once served as the imperial palace for 24 emperors during the Ming and Qing Dynasties (1368 - 1911). Now known as the Palace Museum, it is to the north of Tiananmen Square. Rectangular in shape, it is the world's largest palace complex and covers 74 hectares. Surrounded by a 52-meter-wide moat and a 10-meter-high wall are more than 8,700 rooms. These facts will make any tourist to have an obligatory tour at the Forbidden City. Going here is accessible by public transportation, and you need a half day to complete the tour from Tiananmen Square to the end gate of Forbidden City. There are also audio guides available for rental if you would like to get each detail of the area. After a half day tour, you may spend a lunch or dinner at the nearby restaurants, or head to Wangfujing area."
Go early in the day it gets extremely busy throughout the day. If you don't need to visit Tiananmen Square go through the gate near the East Gate to bypass the frontline and just hit up the Palace museum ticket booth. Remember to bring your passport if you will need it to purchase tickets. The walking tour is also only one direction so you will have to work through the palace to get to the back to exit. Lots of open areas and gets very packed so wear a face mask to avoid allergens as well as other air pollutants.
It was too many people there and especially locals. Interesting walk with guide which we found inside ( not certified but cheap) but after 2 hours we were very tied because of crowd. But anyway place really very interesting and it is big part of china history. So must a visit
"I have heard of this city all of my life. I'm 70 years old. I finally have visited. It was quite crowded. Culturally speaking American people do not want to be pushed and jostled. If you don't like crowds this might be a problem.
However, the for bidden city is glorious. Authentically Imperial."
This is the palace of the Ming and Qing dynasty since the 15th century. A lot of history at every turn. There are also lots of artifacts and statues on display. Be sure to engage a guide to understand what you are going to see. The official guide can be engaged at the counter next to where you rent the audio guides. This is a huge place so do allocate more time for your visit. The products sold at the souvenir shop may have quality issues so be sure to check the products clearly before paying. Best to buy from outlets before the ticketed area so you can go back to do exchange. There is a restaurant inside the palace and a number of drinks kiosks. Be sure to ignore the touts outside the palace claiming to include package tour to great wall.
"It's an interesting place to visit and one should visit once at least if in Beijing . Some people like it and some don't but for me it's one of those sights I'd only visit once cus it's crowded, and nothing special. I'd rate this place as an average ."
"Is it crowded - yes. Is it worth it - yes! Give yourself plenty of time , have some water with you and to stroll around. Truly a gem of Beijing"
Alot of people on sundays so prepair for standing in line for the tempel. Other wise go up on the hill after you are done and you can overlook the whole city rly cool
"This requires a lot if walking, so you should prepared, that being said it's well worth it! There is so much to see and not enough time!"
"Overwhelming. We made the mistake of going on a Sunday. Don't. Suggest that you book a guide, you will get so much more out of it."
"No question, must see the Forbidden City if traveling to Beijing. Stop in the gift shop for really cool gifts, personalized necklaces, that are reasonably priced. Don't forget to bring your passport for entry."
"Nice to see but with 999 bldgs., they seemed to blend together along one LONG walk. Well kept and showing much detail in and outside, the bronze statues and caldrons were a photographic prize. Just remember: wear your most comfortable walking shoes and you will be able to enjoy the entire complex."
This review may be somewhat biased as we had horrible smog on our trip (198 which we were told wasn't even that bad! - it looked horrible ) and honestly could not wait to get out of Beijing. The forbidden city was very grand in size but nothing special to look at. You're not allowed inside the palace so it's really just large courtyards with statues guarding the residence
"A few tips. You need your passports to buy tickets. Make sure you join the right queue for tickets, we joined the wrong queue over to the left initially and bought tickets for the Tianman Gate. They were lovely and refunded us immediately but if this was a busy time we could have wasted a lot of time. The Forbidden Palace was truly amazing and one of the things I will remember forever. We got the audio guide in English which was really informative and uses GPS to know where you are standing and what you need to know"
"It feels like everyone in China is at the Forbidden City. From the lines to purchase the tickets to the line for the security check and the pushing required to see the emperor's room. Everything is impressive but the crowds ruins it a bit. I have a feeling going near the latter half of the day maybe better, since most of the tour operators are on a schedule and the Forbidden city is one of the first items on the list for the day."
Take a tour with a guide - You will learn so much more. What an incredible span of emperors and history.
"Huge Place and Impressive. But as all the palaces are locked off one can but just wander through the Palace grounds and see all the same Buildings. Not comparable to Versailes or Catherin's palace in St Pietersburg where tourists are allowed in, even if being shepparded like sheep to see.Over 2800 Rooms they should at least show something of the Interior. Huge disappointment."
This was nice to see but involves a lot of walking. Please be aware people of color that many Chinese people do not encounter outsiders so they will stare and take photos of you. They are curious about us and so when you come to places like the Forbidden City be prepared.
"It was fascinating visiting the forbidden city. Great history Go early and avoid the crowds but enjoy the atmosphere and the stories of the emporers
and their concubines."
"We rushed through all of this area, as it tended to repeat it self although we loved the collection of ancient clocks Don't miss this."
"Tian namen square is a must see in Beijing. Such a powerful statement and place.

Some advice on the forbidden city - As a ""paraplegic wheelie"" I'll come out of the blocks with this wasn't easy... as a manual chair user you'll need to bring all your skills and stamina not to mention your fat tyres and castors. Cobblestones galore so prepare for some hard conditions. It's worth it though... so much history here!!! Big language barrier, get the pocket tour guide app!!

There is limited but worthy wheelie tourist routes, my advice is buy a lithe translator and try to visit during quieter times. I'm unsure how a electric chair could visit this site some transitions are very rough. Wheelie loo's exist but usually locked by the attendants so don't wait, ask them to unlock.. good luck!!"
"Day Two in Beijing was spent at the Forbidden City - a must see when visiting Beijing. We spent the day again with our Guide Jerry from WildChina - he was attentive, knowledgeable, and very nice. Without a guide I don't feel my experience would have been as holistic as we were able to get a sense of the happenings in each of the rooms as we toured."
"This was massive and worth a look BUT it is a massive attraction for the Chinese as well and as a result was so so busy. The rooms with the golden thrones and treasure in are blocked off and you can only look inside them and take pictures. The opening to each room was so small you couldn't get a look because of the sheer amount of people. We enjoyed a walk through and decided not to fight the crowds to get pictures of the inside of each room. We decided to buy a souvenir book with pictures instead! It is only open from 8.30-4.30 and last entry is 3.30. They also restrict the amount of tickets they sell each day to 80,000 so we got there for 8.30am and even then didn't actually get in until 9am because of the queues and getting through security etc. It is really busy - be prepared!!"
"Make sure you have your walking shoes on! The Forbidden City is so big you can spend an entire day there, possibly two if you want to stop and read everything.

No. 1 Tip - you need to show your passport to purchase tickets. Don't forget it, I luckily used my Australian Drivers License as I had my left my passport behind. But others in our line were not so lucky & were turned away.

Tour guides might approach you to take you around the site. We didn't do this, but my sister did and was very appreciative that she did.

There are secret displays inside what look like walls through small doorways which open up to be museum displays. It was a gift that kept on giving!

It is not a location suitable for a wheelchair. Steps & doorways & cobble stoned walkways abound, any low level of fitness or disability & I would suggest rethinking your trip.

There aren't too many food venues or bathrooms so if you need something when you see it, use it.

The curation of displays was wonderful! The monument size of the place is breathtaking. History is made interesting when you can experience it like this.

I would visit again, just to see the other stuff I missed!"
We visited here in March and outside of school holidays. The history here is incredible but it was incredibly busy even during a 'quiet' period.
"Omg... It was such a bad experience!! Hubby and I were so excited to visit this location, but as soon as we got there, we knew it was going to be a horrible experience.

It felt like there were at least 100 thousand people there at the same time. NO EXAGGERATION.

Impossible to walk, impossible to take pictures, visitors were rude, guards were rude, a complete caos. The X-ray line was massive. And it is one line after the other to enter places.

We couldn't reach the main hall, which was a shame. But it was all due to the massive crowd.

Our guide said that it is ALWAYS like that, every hour of the day, all days of the year."
"Beautiful buildings, very busy long ques for tickets. Beautiful parks on either side of the Forbidden city."
Take a guided tour of the Forbidden City. Requires half a day to cover briefly. Enjoyable visit and lot of walking.
"Came to the Forbidden City after visiting Tiananmen Square. Very busy but the buildings are so beautiful and so well preserved, with painting going on all the time. The steps are quite uneven so be careful if unsure on your feet."
"Our hotel said that we would need 4 hours to see this. They weren't exaggerating. This place is massive. Just when you think you've reached the center, there's more! We went on a Chinese Holiday and the place was mobbed but still relatively accessible. Definitely worth a visit if you have a short layover in Beijing."
"The most striking aspects of the Forbidden City are its immense size... and that everything looks the same. You will walk through courtyard after courtyard where all the buildings and art look pretty much identical.

I felt that there wasn't as much to see and do here as at the Summer Palace (another top Beijing destination), but I would definitely go just because of the history surrounding the place itself. You are viewing structures with over 500 years of history, and walking on the same paths that Chinese emperors have walked in the past. I think that alone is worth the visit."
"The Forbidden City is a must see attraction; however, the crowds are fierce. Sadly, you pass through as a herd of cattle and it is difficult to admire the beauty of this attraction. Despite the crowds, you must visit."
"its old and historic tourist spot, you wouldn't regret it if you feel it, imagine that ancient time. its really difficult for you to take a good landscape or portrait cause its full of people unless low season."
"Architectural marvel shows rich Chinese history and culture, magnificent must visit, accessible from the metro stn"
"There are so many buildings in the Forbidden City and palace museum has interesting artifacts, furniture, and items for special ceremony that the emperors and their families used. There are windows where visitors can look and take pictures. There is the strong influence of superstition and deity"
The first time we visited China we came to the forbidden city. It was spectacular! it felt like you travel 1000 years in the past. It's absolutely beautiful and well preserved. Perhaps the most amazing attraction to see in China.
Such a beautiful place. The scale of the city is overwhelming. Wonderfully reconstructed or preserved. It was great to be able to enjoy this place with so many local people.
"This is a huge area to walk through and towards to the end, it's hard to appreciate its beauty. It is worth making the effort to do so as the sheer scale of the Forbidden City is unbelievable. It worth walking up the stairs in the Garden just outside to get an overall view. Try to avoid smoggy days as the view isn't as good."
"This place is so huge. It's beyond belief the place, the buildings, structures and how people lived many many years ago.It must have taken hundreds and hundreds of workers to construct. The paintings , the architecture,the grounds ,the gardens. Just superb."
We visited the Forbidden City as part of a small tour group and were lucky to have a very knowledgeable guide. Although we arrived well before the City was opened we still had to queue to gain entrance. There were already thousands of people waiting in the line! Once inside we needed our guide to explain what we were looking at and this is a place that I would not recommend visiting without a guide. The crowds were horrendous and we discovered that the Chinese do not queue but just push and shove to see what they want. We quickly learned that if we wanted to see the main sights we would also have to push. Definitely well worth visiting but be prepared to use your elbows to protect yourself!
"I love people so the crowds don't bother me. And there are a lot of people there almost every day. My fellow Humanists and I posed before the huge photo of Chairman Mao before entering the City, forbidden because you once needed permission from the Emporer to enter. Now, all are welcome inside. This place is huge! It goes on and on and on. Ancient cobble stone streets make you glad you brought your walking shoes. Don't miss the Hall of Clocks!"
"Otherwise, I'd only give it three stars. The lines were huge. First, you have to wait in line to clear security. Then, you have to wait in line to purchase museum tickets. Finally, you have to wait in line to get inside the museum. We went on Monday, Aoril 3 and someone mentioned that it was a Chinese Holiday so maybe that's why it was so crowded. We also went early, but the lines were still long. You might not want to go if you have small kids who don't have the patience to stand in line and who might not get much out of it."
"a huge museum compound which worth to spend whole day inside. remember to bring enough water and bread etc.

it is #1 must visit place in Beijing, so do depart early in the morning to avoid the big crowds and tourist groups from all over the worlds.
there is a tight security check once you get up from TianAnMen East station subway exit. we arrived here 10+ in the morning and were queue for an hour just to pass the security check."
"This enormous plot containing a series of buildings is stunning, quite well maintained and breathtaking."
"My husband and I recently were lucky enough to visit this beautiful place. It seems to go on and on and on and the architecture was just glorious. Having said that it was also quite emotional knowing that people literally spent their entire lives within its confines - large though it was. I particularly enjoyed and felt connected with the Imperial garden - quite amazing with its stark rock structures. I had actually also recently seen the movie ""The Last Emperor"" - so glad I did as it gave some context to the buildings that for the most part you can only look into not go into and walk around."
"Visited here at the beginning of February with a friend. Lovely place to visit, fantastic insight into China. Lots of walking and steps, but manageable for most. We came at around midday and there were still tickets available, however this won't be the case during the busy months when tickets sell out very early. Also you will need your passport to buy a ticket for the forbidden city.

Good food on offer within the walls. Easy to get to using the subway system. When you leave you come out a long way from where you started, so is a bit of a walk back to the subway and there didn't seem to be many taxis around.

Bring tissues for the toilets....toilet roll in public bathrooms in china is not common!!!!"
"you can not go inside the palace ,all of them is the same ,it's not very exciting or beautifull place"
"This was the highlight of our first day in Beijing! It was amazing to stroll through the grounds and imagine what it once must have been like. We had an excellent guide (through Lily's Private Tours out of Xi'an) to take us through and help us explore this wonder. Take the time to stop and examine the details. It's size is impressive, but it's in the little details, like the ceramic wall decorations and the roof adornments, as well as the items you can see inside some of the buildings, that really intrigued me."
"This place was huge and beautiful. Everywhere I looked I saw something that intrigued me. From gardens to temples to clocks to walkways and artwork everywhere. Beauty and history is vast here. We went at about noon which was not enough time, they started hearding us out by 4pm. I'd say the hearding out in a harsh manor was my only negative thing to say but it enough to drop my rating less than a 5. If you want see it all, go early and make it an all day thing."
"We visited this beautiful complex with a personal tour guide in early March, 2017. There is a lot of walking and the palace is enormous! You cannot enter any of the buildings but you can look through the open windows/doors. The palace was quite crowded in certain areas like the building that housed the Emperor's throne. Lot of people were pushing to get a look, but luckily my husband is over six feet tall and we were able to get through the crowd quite easily. In other parts of the palace, we hardly saw any people at all. Even if you don't have a tour guide with you, you can read the signs throughout the grounds to learn about the buildings/history. It's a UNESCO world heritage site and should not be missed!"
"One of the great sites in the World. Be prepared for a long walk, it seems to go on forever. We had an incredible guide who brought the place to life. Unless you're there you cannot imagine the scale of the place. It does get crowded but because of the size of the site is quite manageable."
"It is a must visit, but it is always crowded. It's important to take your time and look at the side areas for some hidden finds. Don't forget to look up at the architecture!"
"A beautifulbgrand complex with enough plaques to explain what you're looking at. Reasonable entrace fees and close to no lines anywhere despite the large number of tourists. Can't miss in Beijing. If you don't have time to visit it all, you can enter the first gate and get a glimpse of the place."
"If you will visit the Forbidden City you must be in good health, have a nice pair of comfortable shoes, water, and ready for a long walk.

The Forbidden City is the home of the Emperor together with the empress, children, and concubines.

It's huge."
"Visiting the Forbidden City is a must for any travellers to Beijing. As we approached the entry gate the true scale became evident and it was quite a spectacular sight. We soaked up the atmosphere from the outside, enjoying the water fountain show and flower displays before taking on the crowds. Getting inside was an experience in itself as our group of 7 (kids and adults) was lost in the abundance of other tourists and locals. Once inside the crowd dispersed throughout the massive site and we were able to absorb the centre of Chinese history. The site is quite amazing with so much to see and learn. It's easy to imagine what it would have been like for the royal family. Viewing the Emperors throne was a nightmare - so much pushing and shoving as people jostled for a view but there were many spaces to escape the crowds and take in your appreciation for the site. There is a lot of walking involved but it's relatively flat. The shop had some unique gifts not available elsewhere. They were reasonably priced, not tacky and had something for the whole family."
"The forbidden city is a breathtaking place. It contains a lot of history and truly impressive architecture. It is a good idea to get an audio guide, so you can just listen to information as you walk along. The only downside is that the place is always pretty crowded with people, but that is just like most attractions in bigger cities. Going there as early as possible probably is best."
Beautiful architecture. Lots of gardens. Lots of walking and steps. But if you are visiting Beijing don't miss the forbidden city
"I visited the forbidden city in May 2015.
It is an incredible site, drenched in deep history. The whole complex itself is enormous, and provides a valuable insight to ancient chinese dynasties, that I, Myself, had absolutely no idea about.
I would recommend getting there very early in the morning as the crowds are huge and you will wait a long time in line to enter the city"
"It's a very interesting place. Unfortunately I didn't have much time so I only spent an hour there. Three to four hours would be recommended. Also, I think it's worth paying for a guide which surely makes the whole experience more interesting."
"I had the Forbidden City on my bucket list for years, and it did not disappoint. Be prepared for a lot of walking. You will get so much more out of being there if you read some history about the emperors and people who lived here (and watch The Last Emperor). The architecture is amazing -- from the roof lines to the smallest tile details. The imperial garden was breathtaking; be sure to leave time to explore it if you are a garden buff."
"The most beautiful place on earth. The sense of peace and beauty is astounding and we were lucky enough to visit on a ward sunny day in spring.
We were not disappointed, the shear scale of the palace along with the colour and architecture are truly unmissable."
We learn so much history about the area and the entire country of China during our tour. The structures and the size of the area is unbelievable. Very cool place
It was fascinating to see the Forbidden city be prepared for long queues and be prepared to show Photo ID (Passport is best) we were asked for this when collecting tickets and had been pre warned. The audio tour is available after you buy tickets it only worked intermittently but its all there is no guide books.
"You can't visit Beijing without a trip here, but I was caught out on my first attempt that all foreign visitors require their passport (or some form of photographic evidence) before a ticket can be sold to you. May be common knowledge but was news to my Chinese friends and not mentioned in guide books."
For me the best thing here was watching the tens of thousands of Chinese visitors with their matching hats being led around in a sea of tour guides. This is the most visited attraction anywhere in the world so don't expect much space to yourself. Impressive scale though and some pretty building.
"The palace is very crowded, so like most Chinese attractions, get there early. Few articles of furniture remain, as removed to Tiawan. Allocate approx 3 hours to visit."
High security and numerous buildings but not open to visit. Can look though door into a couple. Lots of same. Photogenic. A must to see in China but wouldn't rush back. Unlike somewhere like Taj Mahal that I would return to.
"The history with a must have tour guide is very interesting but even if athletic and wearing proper sneakers it is a massive walk with uneven grounds that will leave you absolutely done for the day,"
"It was my first attraction in Beijing and I was overwhelmed by the crowds. There were so many people there that I cannot appreciate the place. Forbidden city itself for me was a little artificial with no magic I expected. Too many people, buildings are ok but it can be seen that they are nor original form the past. Not so many to see inside. For me it was just a walk form one gate to another. I didn’t feel comfortable there."
"Absolutely must see in Beijing,. Note they ask for a passport to issue a ticked to enter (driver's license appeared enough). Avoid weekends, need to pass security to enter and there are long lines for that on weekends."
"I visited the forbidden city whilst on a business trip with a colleague. It was raining so it was not too busy. There are multilingual cashiers at the entrance of the site who will sell you tickets for far cheaper than any local hotels or tour services will. You can also hire an automated tour guide handset for RMB 20 which will automatically detect your location as you walk around and tell you information that relates to what you can see. The site itself is quite impressive and worth seeing; just ignore the free-lance tour guides inside the walls who'll try to flog you an overpriced tour or a picture in ""traditional"" clothing. Be prepared also to go through a couple of security checks and to show your passport."
You have to visit this place!! But expect to stand in a long security queue in order to get in there.
"This is the heart of the old Chinese empire, where the emperors and their families lived and ruled. It's not what people think it is. It is not one city behind the walls rather it's a series of palaces. Very well maintained and clean. The most interesting aspect of this was that different palaces were built different emperors and dynasties, this is a must see stop for anyone"
"The Forbidden City is very large and has many buildings. I definitely recommend getting with a tour or guide as there is not a lot of signage in English. There is so much to see, but you won't know what you are looking at without some explanation. Remember to veer off the main middle path down the middle. There are other things to see on the sides and these were much less crowded. Take your time and see all there is to see."
"This is an important landmark to be seen, but I can't say that it was the most interesting way to spend more than just a short time walking through it."
The Forbidden City is a must see in Beijing. The history is amazing and the city stunning . There is a lot of walking wear comfortable shoes and clothes . We had a tour guide which I would highly recommend so you better understand the history and culture. We had Stephen from Catherine Lu tours and they were fantastic.
"Booked tickets online and collected the tickets near the gate.
The Forbidden City is impressive and you will need most of a day to wander around all the parts. It was manageable in winter and you get some relief from the cold by going into rooms/exhibitions.
I found it easy to navigate in a systematic way without having to backtrack. Although it was easy to get lost towards the back as the sections/architecture/layout was similar.

Paid extra for the clock and jewelry exhibitions. These were ok, but they did not make the experience or add any historical significance. I was able to watch the clock winding demonstration - lasted for about 2 minutes; you will miss it if you are late.

I thought the central channel was interesting with the arch stone bridges and frozen water. The external moat added some brutalism."
The peaceful walk through the Forbidden City looking at the architecture was an amazing experience except for some people persistence in selling hats and small trinkets. The gardens are spectator.
"Be sure to take an audio tour guide - 40 yuan. Otherwise, the tour will be useless. Audio guide requires 4 hours to get through all halls . Don't take luggage and heavy bags.Grab snacks and water. Check on photos to know more about tickets."
"Go independently on a weekday and get into the exhibition halls. Most of the central buildings are closed. Lonely Planet info is probably all u need but read up a bit before u go. Interesting history. Watch movie ""The Last Emporer"". The sheer scale of it impresses."
"Definitely a place to visit. We waited to get through security to enter Tianamen Square, the walked to the Forbidden City. The Forbidden City is a vast complex of buildings, with some exhibits. We purchased the audio tour guide in English, which worked pretty well (sometimes was out of synch with where we were). Spent an afternoon there, and could have spent the whole day."
"This place is massive! Use side gates to get in quickly. This place gets a lot of tourists. (mainly Chinese from other provinces) Go with a guide or read about the history, you'll appreciate the place more. We used Daphne Chen Tours - Highly recommended!"
"You cannot come to Beijing and not visit Forbidden City. We had only half a day here when really I think two days would be needed to see a sufficient amount of what's on offer. The architecture and artistry here is truly beautiful. Nothing was overlooked and everywhere you turn there is something to see. Find a guide who knows the meanings behind the choices for statues, etc and the history of the city is staggering. We thought this would be our only trip to China, but I can see myself coming back just to spend two weeks in Beijing to further explore treasures like the Forbidden City."
Leave yourself plenty of time. It took me 40 minutes to get through security into Tiananmen Square and then there is lots of walking to do to get to the Forbidden City and it is HUGE. I hired the audio guide for an extra 40rmb and I think it was worth it as I didn't have a guide.
"Now known as the Palace Museum, the Forbidden City lies to the North of Tiananmen Square and served as the Imperial Palace for 24 emperors of the Ming and Qing Dynasties. Rectangular in shape, it is the world's largest palace complex. Surrounded by a moat and a 10 meter high wall with a gate on each side, architecturally splendid buildings all intricately painted fill up every courtyard. Go early to avoid the crowds and tour groups and long queues at security check points. There is a discount for senior citizens above 60 as well as students so make sure you have your passports and student passes with you. A cultural heritage, this is a must visit."
I stopped here on a 5 hour layover after a business trip to Guilin. It was a quick ride on the airport express and metro system. It is a must see if you are in Beijing!
"This attraction, is of course one of the most important locations in Beijing. But it was SO crowded and simply all of the buildings in the city looked the same! But if you just visit just a part of it for a short time, it's good."
"I was travelling without a group and was able to get away from the flood of people, mostly tour groups, that where heading straight down the center of the Forbidden City. For a quieter time head off to on of the outer areas of the palace and the crowds diminish significantly. Finding peace and quiet allows you to immerse in the history of the site."
"Well, it can's be missed when in Beijing and it is in fact very beautiful, however I was somehow expecting a bit more from it... Don't miss the Jingshan Garden right in front of your way out of forbidden city, the view from the top is a MUST see."
There is no way you could visit Beijing and not visit the Forbidden City. It is so huge and so beautiful. You can't even imagine how ornate all of the decorations are. When I visited I was impressed by how well they keep everything looking great. Everything was freshly painted with bright colours of paint. It was nice to see what it must have looked like back in the day. There are so many different buildings within the forbidden city. So many corners to walk around. So many beautiful things to see. I highly recommend to visit if you get the chance.
This is unbelievable to visit the Empress ruled here and the girls who worked here would die with the emperor. The buildings are magnificent. The history here is amazing and wonderful nothing like how you imagine. It is a long walking tour and would not recommend this is in the hot summer months. It is a very very hustle bustle place thousands of people here.
it's a historical place.There are guards with the uniform.We can feel the atmosphere back then.It's very important place to visit in Beijing.So don't miss it.Also it's closed at 4pm.And the place is super huge.You will spend 3hours to see all the spots.It need a lot of walk.Goods for exercise.
What an awesome experience. The grandeur is unparalleled. The yin/yang. Try and go early or late to avoid the extreme crowds that line up to get through the surrounding area security perimeter.
"This was a most interesting experience - the sheer scale, the architecture, the culture, the decoration/colour and the important history.

Be prepared to do a lot of walking and to be part of very large crowds.

As a European you have to expect being treated as a spectacle yourself. The Chinese will pull and tug at you to be in a photograph with them!

It's all good-natured, but what is less pleasant is the total lack of manners, with people pushing and barging to get through to what they want to see.

There is no orderly queuing, and at times the lack of in/out systems can be dangerous.

Our trip was guided and this is definitely the way to do it - you do need local knowledge to make the most of it.

A nice touch would have been more information boards in different languages and staff in costume.

Even without these, it's still a must-see in Beijing."
"You know you have to go there if you're in Beijing, but it really is more something to be endured than enjoyed. Long lines to buy a ticket, swarms of ""guides"" that want a few dollars to show your around (and steer you to the shops that give them a kickback).

Here's my advice. If the lines are long, pay a guide to show you the East side entrance and then ditch them. Pay them in advance and tell them to get lost, and do what you want, at the pace you want.

The buildings are impressive and all, but I liked the gardens on the North side better. And Tienanmen Square a thousand times more impressive."
"A must see for history buffs... walking through the corridors you get a solemn melancholic vibe.. not the merry pompous one that I was expecting..
Had a tour guide... but was disappointed with the lack of historical depth, was more of an time police/ event organiser rather a guide.. Perhaps reading a historical account first would give more perspective for those of you taking the trip.."
"Amazing architecture, so spiritual with such a vast amount of history behind it. A real must when in Beijing."
"This area holds the ancient temples and buildings that you would see when you are watching ancient chinese movies and everything here is as it is depicted in the movies.

How many times have you seen some pictures and videos only to not have it live up to the expectation? Well I can tell you the Forbidden City is as grand as you hear/see about."
"This place is huge, so much to see! Come with time, so much history, easier when you have a guide tour, they will take to the cool places so you don't loose time specially if you don't have much time to spend."
A must visit. Incredible museum with ancient artifacts.Pad about the Forbidden City. There is enough room to go back in time and pad about like an emperor.
Incredible history and awe inspiring architecture. If you can navigate and accept the crowds and all the tour groups then the splendor and history of this city is amazing. Be prepared to line up and join hundreds and maybe thousands of tourists entering and exploring this site. Be patient.
"Not sure if this is just for the museum or the city itself. The city is a massive expanse of many buildings and fascinating, though some what repetitive in style."
"The Ming Dynasty built this complex. Starting in 1406, finished in 1420, It housed succeeding emperors and dynasties until the revolution of 1911 ended the imperial system. First, be prepared for huge crowds. Apart from the Great Wall, no other attraction has such a draw for tourists as well as citizens of China. Second, so much has been written about this site that it is hard to write a review that says something different. If you have seen the movie, “The Last Emperor (1983),” you will have seen glimpses of the grounds because after China began to open- up after the death of Mao, the government granted permission to film in the complex. The “forbidden” part of the complex refers only to the innermost set of buildings which housed the private quarters of the emperor, his family (including concubines), and closest advisors. The “public” courtyard areas of the grounds are without vegetation or obstruction of any kind. This contrasts with the very lush green, elaborate landscape of the interior gardens. The barren nature of the public space presumably reflects both security and superstition. Security for obvious reasons (openness), but superstition in that placing the Chinese symbol for wood inside that for square equates to trouble. Obviously, no dynasty wanted trouble. Needless to say, the lush, wooded and extensively landscaped interior gardens are not in squares. Note here, as in the summer palace, the use of stone.
Be sure to get a photo of the Night Dragon (in an outer courtyard), one of the largest/longest most elaborate stone sculptures in the world. The inner city is a rabbit warren of individual areas. The story is that is has 9,999 ½ rooms because the palace of the Jade Emperor in Heaven has 10,000. The Emperor, as the son of heaven, cannot insult the father. Our tour guide focused upon the infamous “Dragon Lady,” the concubine who rose to be the most powerful person in China during the years leading up to the 1911 revolution that ended dynastic rule in China. Her quarters were on one of the “side streets” accessed from what appear to be main alleys that lead into numerous isolated courtyards. In fact, many interesting sights are off the side alleys/streets in the east and west palaces.
On this trip we only had 1 ½ hours, but I think that with a guide and more time (or an audio guide) guide), you could still see what you wished in 2 ½ - 3 hours. Because of steps and thresholds, navigating the interior of the complex would be difficult for those in wheelchairs or using walkers."
"Must Rent a audio guide in RMB20, guide you to more understanding the history of the forbidden city, suggest you watch a Chinese drama before you visited (eg: Kangxi Dynasty or the legend of Zeng Huan) ; when u visited it, then you will feel more familiar , lucky that we are born in this century not in that century!

I spent about 6 hours there still cannot finish, because museum also have event to let you visited! Ticket are included, no need buy again!
Special event are no have tour group, you will feel happy and relax when visit!

Take the audio guide then walk around as much as you can! No need to follow the map, just follow your heart and mood then is ok, Remember to bring power bank to charge the hp or camera!"
"The most picturesque entrance are the South Gates, opposite Tienanmen Square, but expect queues and security. If you forgo those the East Gate is an easy access to ticketing and access to the City.
This is one very large complex, its not called a city for nothing. It is very popular with the locals who represent the 80k number that are allowed to visit each day except Monday.
Do yourself a favour, as you follow the central path, veer away to the east and west palaces and the various Palace Museums. Artifacts of jewelry, ceramics and other precious items are available for viewing.
This site has to be on anyone's agenda for Beijing. Go early in the day.(and don't forget your passport, no passport no ticket)"
"We went here after reading reviews, and we are glad to have came. It's a must see when in Beijing if you are looking for ancient Chinese architecture & culture. This was the image of China that I have had in my head all these years. The line ups are long to get in, but they go veryyyyyy quick, so do not be discouraged by the long line ups. You buy tickets once you are inside, after the security line up. And you need your passport!!!

Have fun."
It shows the depth of their culture. the change of guards is a treat. A good place to collect gifts.
We visited some years ago as part of a tour. The forbidden city is huge. We only stayed for a couple of hours. Best to try to stay longer. A very interesting place to spend time in.
"If you can, after seeing the Forbidden City (and be sure to have either a written explanation of what you are seeing or a tour guide), go to the park behind the Forbidden City, climb to the top and then see the Forbidden City and how vast it truly is. Amazing to imagine it in the days of the Emperors!"
Could be an interesting history but only get to experience the dangerous and aggressive pushing and shoving of the Chinese tourist. Very little information about the history and the buildings all look the same as the government repainted all historical sites in the same way. Just watch a movie and skip the mad crowds.
"Very interesting visit, something that was looked away for so long, the mystery evolving the all building, the history with so many century, a must if you are in Beijing!"
"Spent pretty much the entire day at this palace. Highly recommended if you are interested in China history. The buildings and structures are majestic and well preserved. Would suggest renting the audio guide at the entrace (can't remember exact but ain't expensive as they return you the deposit once you return the device) and stroll at your own pace. Not recommeded to join tours as it will be too rush. Start the trip early as it closes early at 430~5pm. After which, could consider visiting the park opposite which could give q great overview of the entire forbidden city.

Advise to check out the directions (if you are traveling by public transports) and AVOID anyone approaching you to offer tours. There are alot of such offers around the place targeting tourists. Have personally experienced a rip off and bad experience."
Fascinating history I have always wanted to see. Must see if you are ever in Beijing. I specifically stopped in Beijing just to see it.
The forbidden city is an absolute must for a visit to Beijing. The history and culture are breathtaking.
There is a lot of history here - lots of nooks and crannies to the explore in addition to the main palaces. You need your passport to get in.
"We visited the Forbidden City as part of a large tour group & were rushed round it, as we discovered on our return to the UK that large tour groups are only allowed 2 hours maximum inside the Forbidden City. On our previous visit to Beijing as independent travellers we spend over 5 hours exploring the Forbidden City and visited all of the museums and rooms in there. I felt sorry for the rest of our party who had not had the opportunity to view this amazing place in its entirety."
"This is one of the most important visits in my life. Stay in the Forbidden City is an amazing experience.
You can breathe the history of that edge. The edge of the King where a huge power was in the end of god in the earth.
No words just keep silence and listen all around you"
The Forbidden City can be overwhelming. There are several main 'gates' and staircases to file through w/ old bronze statues and giant gilded pots. Don't miss the intricate carved staircases. The Chinese use the main gate near Tiananmen Square to take photos w/ Mao's huge image; the queue can be hours. Use one of the side gates to go direct to the ticket window & inside the City- we had no queue.
The Forbidden City really shows you the extent of China's former imperial might. The complex is simply awe inspiring.
"Cant write anymore than what was already written by millions of people.

Full of history. If you go there without a guide or not knowing the history, then you will only be seeing some old buildings.

However once you know and appreciate the history of the palace, you will see the palace in a totally different perspective.

Try to spend at least 5 hours if not the whole day there.

Get a guide for a small fee from the main entrance. Make sure they have the proper permits. Souvenirs and food and drinks and very affordable inside the palace.

Most importantly..please bring your passport or driving license in order to buy a ticket. This is the only site where you need documentation to buy tickets. Without it, its a no go."
"This is one of those experiences where I kept thinking I have the view that perfectly defines Imperial China at its most magnificent, but it kept getting better. I was there for almost five hours and only left because I was getting sunburned (bring sunscreen, hat, or umbrella). It was every bit as good as I might have hoped. The architecture, arts, and history combined to make it a must-see destination."
"This place is seriously huge! You will need at least three hours if not a lot more and depending on when you go you will play squash the tourist as it gets busy. In fact it is hard taking a photo without someone stepping in front of you. My advise it learn to push in as the Chinese do it and so if you want to see something just push back. You will be fine as no one minds. Standing on the stairs looking at the huge square from the movie the Last Emperor is just awe inspiring. There are so many things to see that you will not get bored for hours. Take comfortable shoes, be prepared to walk, be prepared for stairs and take bottled water with you as it saves you standing in line."
Impressive everyone should see can't say anymore then that. It's so impressive as to the capabilities of a bygone era
"It is a very interesting tourist place, very well maintained. However the security make you wait min 1h in a queue to entrance the square before this tourist attraction"
"Before we get into the Forbidden city, they are many gates block us from the outside.
The city has large area to be visitted and a lot of buildings. Also the special building for dragon lady, the living room, kitchen, bedroom, etc."
"we went with a tour group so we got a lot of the histoy of the palace information that way. Not sure if there is a way to get it other wise of if you just look around with no information. you have to watch out for pick pockets. It is very pretty but you can't go into any spaces just look from the outside, which is hard to do with so many people. The rest rooms don't come with toilet paper you have to bring your own and they are outside of the temple so go before you go in or hold it. The garden attached is very pretty. Much of the side is currently under construction."
"One can easily spend half a day just wandering around, or even a full day when visiting the museums onsite."
"We enjoyed our visit to the Forbidden City. It took hours to explore as it is a very extensive area with many courtyards, rooms, buildings, etc. The main downside was the insane crowds of Chinese/other tourists, it was a little much. It was very interesting to see and learn about as we had an awesome tour guide, Daphne Chen."
"It is huge, very impressive and helps to understand the history of China. At least 3 hours to visit."
"It had snowed the day before and the streets could be icy, so our concierge at the nearby Renaissance Wangfujing Hotel suggested we take a taxi. We still wanted to walk a bit, so he got us a taxi and we went to the East entrance of the Forbidden City and then walked to the South entrance where everyone gets tickets and enters the fortress gate. This worked out very well as the walkways around the Forbidden City were reasonably cleared, and we avoided the more slippery walkways between there and the hotel.

The Forbidden City is made up of many halls and long walks. Be prepared, especially on a cold, icy or snowy day, to take your time so that you don't slip. It was still crowded, too, though less than peak season.

We did not have a guide, since we could read about the many halls and history of the palace online. We followed the map of the palace grounds and headed north. At each hall, you will encounter throngs of photo takers with selfie sticks. Either press on slowly until you have a spot at the front, or go to one of the viewpoints on the side where you can easily find a spot to take a picture. You will not be able to enter the hall, so most photos will come out okay, but not spectacular because of the lighting. At the Imperial Gardens don't miss -- you'd have a hard time missing it -- the artificial mountain (Piled Elegance Hill). It is very impressive. From there you will have a short walk to the exit of the north gate.

From the exit, we walked east along the frozen moat - which looked neat in the cold -- and used GPS on our phone (I used a China Unicom SIM) to navigate the residential streets back to the Renaissance Wangfujing Hotel -- which we enjoyed staying at.

The temperature was in the 30's (Farhrenheit) and clear. We dressed appropriately and enjoyed our walk through the impressive Forbidden City."
"Walk in the footsteps of the Ming and Qing dynasties. This well preserved compound is a sight to be seen. Wear comfortable shoes, as there is a lot of walking. You can take in a superficial viewing is as little as 2-hours, or spend days/months diving deep."
"Interesting to see as part of your tour in Bejing. Not my favorite in China but worth a visit. If you only have a limited time, I prefered Summer Palace as it was more beautiful."
If you are in beijing you have to go to the forbidden palace. I recommend to arrive at 8 to get in at 8:30 because it gets really really crowded.
Amazing the history and the size of the place would definitely recommend this with a tour guide so they can explain about the whole story of the forbidden city .
Large complex. Be prepared to walk a lot around the place. Ticket needed to get into the forbidden city. Remember to bring your passport as ticketing is only with ID. Interesting and historic place. They don't a lot of renovation so not as authentic as I remember when I first went many years ago. Also no Starbucks shop!...where did it go? I was looking forward to a coffee at Starbucks in the forbidden city!
It was interesting to know the history of China and the dynasties while visiting the forbidden city from the tour guide.
"An great, MUST visit place but plan enough time, the place is huge.
Important for a visit with kids is to give them a flavor of the history to better understand the place.
Spring is a good time for the visit, as entrance prices are low and the queues not too long - also the temperature is better than the heat in summer!"
"A visit to the Forbidden City in Beijing is a must see. Every building and temple in the Forbidden City is richly decorated. All the details are perfectly preserved. I highly recommend China Highlights to visit China. China Highlights are very well organized, affordable, very courteous, and very professional."
"Please spend the 2 hours visiting Forbidden City. Excellent experience. I would like to visit again sometime.

Great Choice for Layover Tour"
"C'mon. You're already in Beijing, you have to visit the Forbidden City. Just be sure to arrive well before the ticket windows close because the security line can take a while to get through before you can get your tickets."
"First off, this place is ridiculously crowded. And I went during the 'off season'. But I'm still glad I went and thoroughly enjoyed it. We went with a tour guide which was great as she explained a lot. It is a lot to cover and you could easily a lot of time here."
A busy place with lots to see. Lots of walking. It is interesting . A guide is needed to explain things. We were very tired after our trip
"Following Trip Advisor's advice we came around 8.30am. There was no queue to the ticket office and no queue to the bag check so we were inside within 5 minutes. There was already quite a few people inside but not too many comparing to the crowd an hour or two later. The buildings inside are beautiful with exquisite, detailed painting - a must see while in Beijing.
If you're not Asian looking be prepared to be quite an attraction too, especially if you have blond hair. Most people will stare, some will come up and ask for a photo but majority will take a photo when they think you're not looking."
"Forbidden City was the Imperial Palace from the Ming dynasty to the end of Qing dynasty, years 1420 to 1912. Its located in the center of Beijing, and now is the Palace Museum. Its loaded with historical information. Its the largest ancient palace structure in the world."
"There is now a one way system of entry and exit for this. You can only enter from tianneman square and exit from the north gate.

Once you have gained access, which in busy season is a challenge, get a map!!!!!

This place is huge and you will not see it all unless you allow a whole 8 hour day 8:30 to 16:30, ( the opening hours), and have a map to navigate. Also be aware that some of the sub sections start closing at 16:00.

The whole palace is now basically a big museum with different buildings housing different exhibitions. All of it is interesting but something of the magic of the imperial forbidden city has been lost. I would much rather have seen it all as it was at its peak.

Two dynasties used this palace as home for a long time, apart from the actual buildings and gardens there is very little left to mark that fact.

In one of the outer sections there is a touching exhibition concerning the emperor and his mother. She lived to 86, the longest living dowager empress and died with faculties intact and much loved. Her will extracts make interesting reading."
"Of course if you are in Beijing you will want to visit the Peoples Square and the Forbidden City - along with the thousands and thousands of other people doing the same as you!

A must see and do but be prepared for the crowds."
"I’ve been here several times in the past and I constantly discover new things which is not surprising as it contains 9,000 rooms spread over 250 acres. It sits on the edge of Tiananmen Square and it is still fascinating with the original built in the 1400’s and most of what you see today built in the 1700’s. It is always worth a visit and the admission fee of 60 RMB is cheap."
"Beautiful buildings and many wings of history. With young kids we did not have patience to see all the rooms. We took a personal guide to help us pick the best parts to be able to see the most while the mood was still good. She could also answer whatever question we had about the many buildings or animal-figures.
After the Forbidden city we climbed the stairs to the ""Buddha tower"" and that gave a very nice view over the Forbidden city, which was a good finish of the visit."
"Amazing place. It's everything your expecting, huge, beautiful and of course epic in proportion. The rooms you can visit are stunning, the emperors chambers are fascinating. You'll see small grooves cut into the door frames, these allowed the emperor to cycle around the city. Truly an awesome place."
"We visited in the summer, end of June, and it was unbearably hot. With the heat, humidity and poor air quality our small children were very uncomfortable and upset. Luckily they sell ice cream every 10 feet, and I think we gave them about 7 each that day to get them to stop whining.
It's unfathomably huge, and a very odd feeling to walk around these buildings. The grounds are massive, so wear comfortable shoes as its LOTS of walking. The most private garden in the back was my favorite as it was less imposing. It was very crowded, but I think they always have an insane number of visitors."
"Is snowing when I visit forbidden city, I read and know about the history . Is a great place u must visit when u come Beijing . The ticket is 40rmb . Suggest u come early morning . Take subway to tiananmen station then walk .."
"Visited this palace on my second day in china, it was freezing!!! Walked around the big square, also is the place of Mao Tsetun's mausoleum, after here we proceeded to the palace museum, a breath taking place, so much history about the ming dynasty, a lot to see here."
"The Forbidden City was amazing. HUGE !!!
A must see in Beijing!! We were very fortunate to have a guide that explained the history . I wish we had watched the movie , The Last Emperor, before we visited."
"First of all, we took the Subway to Forbidden City, my husband and I were on our own, we decided we wouldn't take a tour and just venture on our own. When we arrived we exited on the opposite side of the street and there were 4 really long lines, I couldn't tell what they were for, so, we asked a security officer and he said they were to enter Forbidden City. We waited about 20 minutes, went pretty quick they needed to check bags, then immediately thereafter there was an underground tunnel to pass to the other side and we got right in, there were masses of people (we went on a Sunday morning) then purchased our tickets (as a foreigner, you will need your passport in order to purchase a ticket). The whole tour was about 1 hour 1/2 . We were told not take a taxi outside the Forbidden City so we walked around the outside to go back to the subway. Overall, this place is full of history and it truly is very interesting. I would recommend if you're in Beijing."
"Really interesting place, just like all the pictures. There were quite a few people so I'd recommend going first thing in the morning to try and escape the crowds."
"Need to visit at least once in a lifetime, the palace is so grand. Can't imagine how the Emperors/Empresses lived during the height of the civilization there. Expect crowds during public holiday season."
"Not a super tour, mainly because it's mostly the same thing over and over. The lines to get in can be long making it even more unattractive. However, if you decide to go, get a tour guide. The most interesting things about the forbidden city are the things you won't read on any signs within the walls. Plan on about 2-3 hours to see it all."
"My last trip to China was 15 years ago and it certainly has changed dramatically, the visit to the Forbidden City remains a MUST see vista, although as in all mayor World sites, the immense flow of tourism damages the sites and there fore Governments have to protect them, it is still an overwhelming visit. Ask your guide to take you to the Pavilion of the clocks, it is dark and dusty, but the splendor cannot be erased. In the back you may sit and watch a film, where you will be able to see all the clocks showing off their intricacy of its mechanisms in working condition.
Its a place of grandeur, impeccable refinement that cannot be compared with anything else you have ever seen."
"Worth a visit but foreign tourists be aware of organized scams targeting English speaking tourists. We were scammed by two ""nice""women claiming they were English teachers, wanting to spend a few hours to practice English. They invited us for tea that at the end cost us 550¥."
this is a must see. lots of people even in middle of february. lots of steps and most doorways have a step over so watch your footings. don't follow the crowd straight up the middle go right or left and around the edges. Lots to see and you won't miss anything and you get a good view from a distance.
You must have atleast 3 Hours time to see this place properly.The visit starts from the Tian an mein Square and ends at the south gate of the forbidden city.You get a glimpse of the chinese culture by visiting this place.
"We had a brief walk through the Forbidden City. We were short on time and the security line to get in took an hour. Do have your passport with you. Was well worth the wait however. In wanting to become acquainted with China a visit here is a must.

Audio guides are available and recommended, but even walking thru without is a learning experience. Allow enough time - minimum one hour to just walk through. The grounds are immense!
Highly recommended."
"THIS IS A MUST-SEE. The history behind the construction of the Forbidden City is quite interesting palace! this part of the city is one of the most famous , because of the history and art that you can find inside the museum!"
"The Forbidden City is a definite must see in Beijing, but be prepared to go through several security checks, one of which can take anywhere from 1-2 hours. During that time, you will be pushed, nudged, shoved, and pressed on all sides. I would not take small children unless you have a good game plan on protecting them. The audio guide is decent, and better than staring aimlessly at beautiful buildings or paying for a personal guide. You've got to see it in Beijing, but be prepared to build up some patience. And dress for the weather - go out with layers if visiting during the winter months! The off season times mean a few less tourists as well, but don't worry, there will be PLENTY of people."
"Although no one could deny this place is amazing, it was less fun for me to visit because it was so crowded. I went on a weekday during winter and was amazed by the crowds. The summer palace was a lot less crowded and much more pleasant to me. When you get off the subway at tiananmen east station, it is very difficult to even find which exit to take. I asked multiple people before someone could tell me which one because it is not listed on the signs - silly. Once getting out of the exit turn to the right and you will see a swarm of people in a large line. All it says it the line is for a security check and it doesn't say anything about forbidden city. I waited in the cattle car line for a good 30 minutes before getting in, jammed in with thousands of other tourists pushing you. After getting in it was difficult to figure out where to go, how to buy tickets, where the entrance was to what place. Very little info on English. Once I finally figured out where to go, I made it in and was confused about what was there to see. So many people at every turn that I simply had a harder time seeing anything. Sigh. Perhaps go here with a tour guide."
"We used China Highlights for our two days in Beijing and our tour guide, Jerry, was able to navigate us around the Forbidden City, showing us the key highlights and giving us the history in a way that maximized out time. He seemed to know the short cuts but did not skip anything that was worth seeing. Excellent guide and wonderful place to visit. We were there in February and the light snow flurries were so romantic that we did not mind the cold."
The palace itself is huge. Visit here after tiananmen is mostly people's route. But it needs a good stamina to finish the walk. A trip to beijing without forbidden city is not considered as a beijing trip. So dun skip dis.
"Loved our visit; it's an amazing site - vast and full of superb buildings, colours, structures, and open areas. It does, after several transitions into the next zone, get a bit repetitive and begin to mess with your mind as you step through one doorway into the next area of the 'city' and it appears almost the same as the last - heard similar feelings expressed by other visitors of 'deja-vu'. But who cares, it's the Forbidden City in Beijing... we loved our visit regardless."
This is a must see in Beijing. A good idea of the lives of the old Emperors. Not too crowded in mid winter but must be extremely crowded in summer.
"Very pretty, lots of history, watched the guards in training and getting inspections. The only negative to get in was the security lines through Tianamen Square. If you can have patience getting through, well worth it but go early for less crowds."
Incomprehensibly massive and impressive. THIS IS A MUST-SEE. The history behind the construction of the Forbidden City is quite interesting and worth visiting with a tour guide. You will feel like an insignificant speck in the midst of the breadth and depth of this place. This was the seat of the Chinese government and residence for 24 Ming and Qing emperors over 500 years. The extravagance is just stunning. You can view original furniture in the buildings.
"A lot of history here, didn't quite realise how massive the place was!! you get past one section and then see the next lot of impressive buildings as well as pagodas seen far away into the hills. Great experience and would recommend to tourists wanting to get a taste of the history of the dynasty."
"We really enjoyed our trip to the Forbidden City. It is huge and we probably only saw a fraction of what there is to see.

As you enter you walk through a series of massive squares with the classic Chinese gates at either end and you gradually get closer and closer to the inter palace where the emperor used to be.

We couldn't really see inside the throne rooms because it was just like a rugby scrum to get near the front - we didn't have sharp enough elbows to push our way to the front.

There is on the whole good access for a pushchair with lots of ramps - but it is not perfect we had to do quite a bit of lifting.

Don't go on a Monday though - we did the first time and it is closed."
"The Forbidden City is a must when you visit Beijing.
Advice: try not to visit on weekends but if you must, arrive early and prepare for large groups of Chinese tourists. The majority of people there are not from Beijing and they may not be used to seeing ""foreigners"" so be prepared for a lot of pointing and gawking. If you have young children keep them close for safety cuz the crowds get big. They may wish to take pictures of you and your children out of fascination.

That said, it is an amazing place to wander around. The emperors of the past lived here and ordinary people were not allowed in, hence the ""forbidden"" part. The buildings have been kept up well.
Expect 2 hours to get through and see everything.

Tip: after you walk through the grounds from south to north, you end at the north gate. In front of you across the street is Jin Shan (coal hill). Go here! Climb up the stairs to get to the top and see the forbidden city from a birds eye view - totally worth it!!! Coal hill will take at least an hour but in itself is a great little addition or a separate trip, depending on how much time you have.
Enjoy!!"
"this part of the city is one of the most famous , because of the history and art that you can find inside, is a good option if you really want to know more about the culture, the tickets are expensive but if you have a student Id you will receive a discount , a lot of people every day , if you want go for all the forbidden city, you will need more than one day. note> bring you own water bottle from outside, because inside are really expensive . a small water bottle is around $5 USD"
"Great visit, great stories and amazing architecture. This is a must see when visiting Beijing. Rich in history"
Absolutely stunning place to visit. A fantastic taste of old China. We found this an amazing half day trip.
Know that when you start this tour it is a long and grueling walk. The architecture is beautiful and amazing. The history behind the emperors and their lives is just really interesting. After a while it just all kind of looks the same. It is a must see but wear comfy shoes and drink plenty of water! Amazing Chinese history!
"Ancient location of Emperor. Beautiful architecture. Big space, souvenir shops. Very near Tiananmen Square."
Enjoyed visiting with our guide and groupe to hear all the stories behind this palace. Very busy but not unusual being in China. Lots of nooks and crannies to visit in get lost in!
"It's a huge place so make sure you have plenty of time to walk around.
Not much directions inside the palace, a lot of the exhibitions and rooms were closed, so we ended up missing a lot of them. Also, BRING YOUR PASSPORT/ID when you buy the tickets."
"Very disappointing, you have to walk a lot, you can't go inside any palace, everything is closed to the tourists, you can only have a very quick glance at the thrones through some bars sealed to the windows and doors. The gardens are OK though."
A must see. I suggest having the services of a guide. Mao's tomb and the National Museum are nearby.
"In terms of understanding China's history, this is a must see location. However, the Chinese government could dedicate more resources to preserving the buildings. It's a shame to see some of these buildings in disrepair."
Spend as much time as you can!! It goes on and on and on. I cannot describe the beauty of the place. When we were there there was Caligraphy show just to the right of the main entrance. We went through the Calligraphy show and it led to a side entrance with no crowds.
"It surprised me that our tour guide - a young lady named Mia, was so well versed in Chinese history, and she made it seem like everyone 'knew that'. Interesting."
"Very educational and interesting, but very crowded too! Try to go early in the morning to avoid lots of queues and wear comfy shoes!"
"Take your passport/ID as you have to show it to buy a ticket! It's also closed on Mondays. I'm glad I went to witness the history, but there is a lot of elbowing needed to see inside the pagodas. It's a long walk back to the front entrance when you leave as you have to go out of a side gate and round the moat, so leave time."
"This takes at least 2 hours to enjoy. It can only be entered from one gate and is one way only..it helps to kerp crowds in order.There are limited passes given each day so if you arrive too late, the 80000 entry passes may have been used already."
"What a rich historical experience that was for me. To imagine the emperor walked around , great stuff.Be aware go early. The place can get insanely busy. Buildings were amazing . Just across the road from where you exit is a park. Climb that hill to get an overview of the forbidden palace."
"Get used to crowds as there are throngs of tourists, mainly locals, fighting to get in and see all the structures. At some, you need to literally elbow your way through. Interesting complex of palaces and meeting rooms, not in the typical European style but worth the history lesson"
"It is closed for tourists on every Monday, please do not plan your travel for this day.
There is a park opposite to forbidden city, very good one, must visit the part and three BUDHA temples on the top!!!"
"You couldn't cover all of this in one day! Great for people who love to learn about a country's culture.
you will not get bored."
"We had to wait in a long line to get in, then go through security and metal detectors just to walk around outside. It was difficult to see much with all the long lines, but what we saw was beautiful."
"Awesome place, packed with history. It would have been lovely if one could actually be allowed inside the halls. I will certainly recommend the visit."
"We arrived in the morning and found that it was a 30 minute line to pass the first security checkpoint. There is a second one after you payed for the ticket.

It was a huge area with lots of buildings and would say that it's very impressive. The main focus is the buildings where you walk through or need to stay outside. There is also some buildings which have more smaller things to look at like jewellery.

Non of the public toilets did have any papers so bring this with you."
"We expected crowds to be everywhere we went in China. We just didn't expect them all to be in one location, so it seemed. The Forbidden City is a formidable sight to see. To imagine what it during its prime is unbelievable. The sheer vastness if without equal."
"Loved exploring and walking around amazing history. We were picked up by a tour guide, Mike, he was very helpful. We hadn't planned on getting a guide as we only had a few hours to explore, but I'm glad we did!"
"Spent the whole day here and only just had enough time to explore all the surrounding palaces to the side of the famous historical central part. Would suggest getting here first thing in the morning before the ticket office opens so you can enter the city before the thousands of Chinese tourists start to enter when it gets very crowded. There were very few westerners there and was considered a curiosity with the Chinese people, many who had not seen a westerner before and wanted to have there photo's taken with us and to practice speaking a few English words. It was a very enjoyable cultural experience."
"This is the first time i visited chinese palace. The palace area is very huge, and at the time i visited it was already 4 pm so it was almost closing time for the palace. I didn't have enough time to explore all of the palace area. But within one hour there i can say that this palace is very beautiful. The architecture is so unique and well maintained. I like the design of the dike and bridges inside the palace court. It gives unique touch to the palace. Absolutely must visit place if you are in beijing."
This was really the highlight of the visit to Beijing. The entrance is very Grand and ornate. My colleagues got me to agree to have my picture taken in the golden Emperor's robes. Then we proceeded to walk through the many many different open squares and Palace buildings. I would highly recommend this even though it is somewhat a touristy thing to do. Even the local Chinese people are the majority of the visitors to the Palace that I could see.
If your really into Chinese history and everything about the palace then it's ya great for you. For people like myself every terrace and square looked the same after a while. I'm glad I went but didn't need three hours inside. Really need a tour to explain everything to you.
Overwhelming trip back into history. Crowds and vendors are part of the magic of traveling back in time.
Visiting in December when its cold is a good time as there are less foreign and domestic tourists. The ticket off is on the left after you pass under heavenly gate but before the security check. Cost 40 Yuan per person off season. Minimise what you carry as it can be bothersome at security. Not a lot to really see with many buildings not open to the public but I did hear the government is going to open more up. Didn't find a lot of toilets. Need to be reasonable agile to negotiate steps. Good idea that it is one way. There is a three star toilet at the exit.
"Make sure your buy your tickets ahead of time if you want to see the 'inner workings' as well a giving yourself time to line up, wander, wait, browse, be amazed and wander some more. Certainly is a 'must' when in town, and takes time as it is huge! Get a good map and plan out your trip as there is heaps to see - getting a guide can be useful but wandering works as well. Crowds are normal, some rude and pushy, some not. If cold - rug up! Most things are in english as well as Chinese, so translation is not too hard. Thoroughly worth it."
This place is huge -- so much bigger than you likely think it is. The history is amazing and the architecture is busy. Do yourself a big favor and get there as early as you can - the crowds will be big.
"No need to say it is not to be missed. The ""must see"" place in Beijing. We had a English speaking guide for our small group, but it was not the best arrangement. Better to do it by yourself, so you cam wander around with no pressure."
"Not a mysterious as it sounds. The Forbidden city is enormous! It's hard to know where to start and what to see. I advise one of the radio tour guides to help you understand what you are looking at. We purchased as pass through ticket and we were able to see most of the buildings. It is all outdoor (and it was cold!) you basically look through the open doors to see the various rooms the emperor lived in, as well as the artifacts and furniture. Despite me HATING selfie sticks, this is a must for good photos. The crowds are huge & rude , making photos impossible & we were there during off season. A selfie stick gets you a perfect photo every time!"
"Excellent option to spend your time in Beijing and see the historical culture there. It is a little bit crowded, but it is not a big problem. To be honest, all the sections are almost equal, but even though they are all awesome. Be careful because you can entry just trough the door which is near the tiananmen square. It is located near a lot of other attractions."
We decided to do this with no tour guide....still not sure if this was a good idea as it's a long walk from the north gate to the south gate without any information and it was very busy. It's obviously a top priority visit for most tourists so always worth a visit but maybe consider a guide....also be aware if going solo the number of the taxi drivers etc waiting at the exit they can be slightly aggressive....just ignore and turn right and keep walking to the crossroads at the end of the street you will see a signpost of the nearest subway stations (10 to 15 minute walk) depending on which one is easy for you!
We visited this as part of our Great Wall of China trip. It has so much history and culture and is a must see if in Beijing
"Loads to see, and really fascinating. Less good for a 7 year old but he enjoyed it to a certain extent; it's amazing."
"Very busy and parts of it under renovation when we visited. Great history, long walking day and lots of stairs. Definitely worth visiting."
"Massive area with impressive architecture witnessing the greatness of the dynasties.

A walk from the entrance gate to the exit takes a good two hours.

Good facilities with Tea house and clean restrooms. Efficient ticket offices and security checks."
"After a very long line we found out that all the tickets were sold out (at 11am) so we couldn't visit the Forbidden City. We were very disappointed! So, I suggest you to book a ticket online some days in advance!"
"This review is a little late but better late than never, I guess...
Words cannot begin to describe the sense of history and grandeur of the Palace Museum. It's been 1.5 years since I visited and I still get goosebumps thinking about the sense of awe that I felt when I first walked through the gate and stepped into the main courtyard. It is literally a scene out of ""The Last Emperor"". Nothing has changed except you are seeing it in real life, and you can touch the gates, the walls and the steps.

There are a lot of areas to explore in the City, but generally, you are moving from the south end to the north end. You can walk through the various small parks, courtyards, and houses. Each area has well-marked signs, artifacts displays and Chinese/English signs.

Tip: When you arrive in Beijing, I recommend that you immediately look up ticketing information for visiting the Palace Museum. When we visited in June 2015, the government had recently enacted a limit of 85,000 (yes, that's an astounding number) visitors per day. Out of those 85,000, most of the tickets would already have been reserved for tour groups. We lined up outside the ticketing area, which you can get to before the actual Palace Museum opens, about an hour before the gates opened. Visit early to avoid the crowds. Although the Palace is huge, you will feel very quickly feel clusterphobic when the big tour groups come through."
"Poorly organised with little to no instructions in English, with pathetic staff, plus denied entry after paying"
"The crowds and heat on the day we visited turn the day into an unpleasant experience. There was too much walking in lines across the square to visit any of the attractions in this area.
The heat and smog spoilt our day."
"WE were there on CNY, so no tickets were available. We still had the opportunity to see the front plaza. My wife enjoyed the visit."
"Seeing the Forbidden City- The Palace Museum in real time instead of just in movies or books was an amazing sight to see! Most of the buildings, if not all, have the original wood from when it was built in the early 1400 hundreds according to our English speaking tour guide, Grace. The name has been changed to The Palace Museum from The Forbidden City because it's not forbidden to go there anymore. The museum is extensive, well built and it's truly a city within a city. We went on a Saturday and it was very busy. However the busyness didn't prevent us from getting a fully entrenched tour and we were able to take plenty pictures. Before entering the museum, we walked through Tiananmen Square which is right outside the gates of The Palace Museum. The Museum is outside of course so dress accordingly to the time of the year. It's very clean and well maintained. There are gift shops and tea shops on the grounds. Be prepared and make sure to take plenty of pictures. Walking into the entrance of the inner court is picturesque and breathtaking view, in fact throughout the museum are breathtaking architecture and artifacts that would warrant pictures. So, if you will be using your phone, with a selfie stick, to be on the safe side, make sure to bring or have an external charger or another means to take photos, other than your phone. Our phones that were fully charged, at the beginning of the tour, quickly lost all its charge, but luckily we had other devices to use. I would also suggest to get a tour guide so that they can tell you about the historical little details that are not described on the various plaques/marquee throughout the museum. It was a very educational, vast and exciting tour."
"This is a whole day event. There is lots to see and it is huge! It would take almost an hour to walk around the perimeter I would guess. If you can, check out the gardens at the north end where you can climb up the hill and look down at the whole city. Beautiful, especially at sunrise. Be prepared to walk...a lot."
"Forbidden City is one of those sites that you really need to see but for me it was just OK. Being January and only 25F didn't help (I'm from Minnesota so it wasn't bad). I have previously gone to Wuhou Temple in Chengdu and think it is WAY better. You can spend a lot of time as there are many sections, but after a while I just didn't care anymore. You couldn't go into most of the buildings and the few that were open had nothing interesting. In the summer, flowers may make it more enjoyable."
"I visited the Forbidden City with my partner and we found it very enjoyable. Mostly outside, the huge site is full of beautiful architecture and great views of the area. Almost everything is outside, though, so bring a warm jacket! Definitely visit the gardens before you go. Wait to buy your souvenirs until the end, the shops get a lot cheaper towards the exit for the same nice things."
"This is a must visit if you are in Beijing. The Palace is across from the Tiananmen Square. This place is magnificent and of historic proportions. This is where emperors lived for years. You might think the building you see in front is the end but it goes on and on and on for about 9 buildings and compounds.

Overall great palace and great architecture and insight into how these emperors lived. Kudos for those who built it. I am glad I was able to experience this magnificent history."
"This is a magnificent place to see. We were on a tight schedule, so stuck to the centre path, only going off into a few side buildings, but it's all brilliant. We only had a couple of hours, but you could easily spend a whole day there."
"I was curious how was inside the Forbidden City. I've got an audio guide that didn't work properly, so I've got a little lost. But was nice to walk around and see all the places. People told me that I should expend half day there and I saw everything in a couple of hours."
"It's said that every Chinese person must one day view this place and the crowds are demonstrable evidence of that. I can't imagine how bad this place would be in the summer heat. Allow yourself a few hours and be prepared to stand your ground against tens of thousands of Chinese tourists, many of whom will be in a group visiting Beijing for the first time in their lives and will be even more confused than western tourists. Chinese security guards are there to keep them in check but they likely won't pay attention to foreigners. At times you may have to barge your way to the front of the queue i.e. to photograph the throne room. Don't be embarrassed. 'Please' and 'excuse me' won't get you far here. Once you're out the other side of the palace avoid the tourist traps and taxis."
"Had a private half day tour. It is one for the list and more if you are a history major. You enter from the South and exit in the North, so plan to have your transport wait for you close to the North gate! I believe the fee to enter is 60/40 depending on the season and that amount for the audio guide. There are three museums that you can see and take shelter from the elements. The first shows the porcelain history of China, this is a large location but hidden from the 'strip'. As soon as you enter, you see the five stone bridges. On the right is a doorway to this museum and a not busy library building. I found the porcelain museum very interesting and quiet. The second is the clock museum, which I passed, and the jade museum just behind it on the NE corner. Both cost 10 each. The large jade exhibit was closed when I visited on Wednesday. The other interesting points are the nine dragon wall and granite sculpture, located behind the palace of supreme harmony, or words to take effect. This is the main palace or hall, but it was bare except for the chair representing the throne. Several bathrooms all over the place. I liked the gift shops at the end next to the garden. Three different unrelated shops. Picked a sunny day, without any wind to speak of, but smog index 100-150, you can smell as if someone was burning outdoors. Most people did not wear any masks."
"This is an absolute must-see attraction when in Beijing. The architecture of this place is amazing and the grounds are excellent.
Very busy place"
"This is a must see in Beijing. The Emperor's residence and working space fore the government. It is very crowded and there is so much here that a guide is desirable. Tourists enter at the South Gate and proceed north through a number of squares separated by gates. The inner most is the Emperor's residence, off limits during most of history."
"If you decide to do this without tour by yourself it is pretty easy. All the signs are in English and the entry cost is 60 yuan. The size of the complex is jaw dropping but use your time wisely as you move through the whole complex. Signs along the way tell you what you are looking at and these are all in English

Do not miss. The treasury, 4 halls on the side of the square, the clock museum and the imperial gardens near the exit. All are 5 star class. Allow a minimum of 3 hours to visit including security checks and when you exit , you are 2600 metres from where you started so consider a taxi to take you back to where you wish to go. The taxi driver bartered with me and took me back to the region for 30 yuan but this was well worth it as I reckon I had walked a good 5km. Do not miss this palace, it is awe inspiring."
"And it certainly does feel like pretty much everyone is at the Forbidden City! It's a truly impressive complex of buildings, and should not be missed, but do try to time it such that you get there outside of tourist peak hours. I went there on a Friday and it was hard to spend any amount of time at a particular site within because of the number of tourists!"
"I like the Forbidden city it is an interesting walk if you have a good guide.
But you don't have to spend several hours here, its just as good to start from Tiananmen square and walk through with a guide say 1-1.5 hrs."
"Only wish we had more time to see the Forbidden City as it has multiple things to view. Exhibits remain shut and the crowds are massive. Best to take a guide rather than trying to understand it on your own as they express the entire story in better ways than the audio guide.

Don't buy merchandise from inside as it is double the price of what you can get outside !

If you're staying at a hostel ask them to guide you to cheap souvenir shops."
"This is a must visit place in beijing. Great historical place. The Palace is so huge, you should a comfortable shoes for walking around this place."
This is an absolute must-see attraction for your first time in Beijing. The architecture is beautiful and the walking grounds are excellent.
"Don't go on Mondays in the winter. It's closed. This is an amazing tourist stop!
All of the informational signs are written in Chinese and English, so you will enjoy your time there even if you don't speak a word of Chinese."
"We visited the Forbidden City in November 2016 and it was a cold, gray day. We went in the morning and the lines weren't long at all. The taxi driver dropped us off and pointed, so we walked towards where local people were queuing up in a line. We had to show our passports to guards and they waved us on realizing we were Americans. Locals were scrutinized a little more. Once inside the Forbidden City we were approached several times by people who wanted our picture (I assumed they were plotting to pickpocket us so I declined)...but my husband had his picture taken several times while I cautiously observed. School children were also thrilled that he allowed them to take his picture with them...very sweet! We spent about 2.5 hours inside without a guide but I would recommend a guide as I'm certain we missed knowledgeable information. Not a lot of places to sit inside the gate so wear comfy walking shoes. Once we were outside the gates of the Forbidden City, there were lots of locals hanging around. Two young female locals approached my husband, as I was walking just a few steps ahead of him, and were full of compliments and talked about how they wanted to practice their English (I've read this several times from other reviewers). We've previously lived in Europe and traveled abroad and I know that there can be friendly, helpful people from time to time, but I knew from the start that they were scammers. She approached me and asked if I wanted to join them for a cup of coffee and I politely declined and kept walking. I watched them turn around and go straight back to the area looking for more gullible westerners. As is the case anytime you're traveling, just be aware of your surroundings and ""overly friendly"" locals!"
"Amazing history! But the audio guides have GPS, not numbers you enter at a given location. In theory, it will start talking about whatever is in front of you. Neither of ours worked consistently, and one died after ten minutes. If you're looking for an informative audio guide, cross your fingers that your device's GPS is strong enough to last."
"Lots of history here, and the place is huge, so prepare for a lot of walking. You'll want to spend a couple hours here at least. The buildings can seem a bit repetitive if you continue down the middle, and you can't enter any of the central halls - just take pictures from the doorway, which crowds of people will shove you out of the way to do. I'd recommend heading off to the side where you can walk into some of the smaller courtyards and buildings, many of which contain small museums. We saw some bronze pieces and old weaponry. Close to the exit are the Imperial Gardens, which are gorgeous and not to be missed. Beautiful ancient trees and coral sculptures and pavilions. Definitely worth the long walk through the other buildings to get there."
Beautiful architecture and design. One cannot go to Beijing and not visit the Forbidden City. Difficult to believe the history within this beautiful place....incredible feeling to be standing there.
"Spent about 6 hrs walking around this amazing place. Quite a few people when we arrived but this place is so big that you hardly notice. You might just have to politely push your way to the front of the queue to see some of the throne rooms. You need your passport to get a ticket, luckily we had ours. If you forget it is a long walk to try to get out as you can't use the gate at the front where you entered. Make sure you have comfortable footwear as you will walk for miles and bottles of water as can't remember seeing any on sale. There are loads of clean toilet facilities so this was not a problem."
"Spectacular buildings inside the walls of the forbidden city. Due to the time of the year it was quietish. One thing I was unaware of was that you need your passport while purchasing your ticket, we had to walk back to our hotel to collect ours which was ok as it was close by but not if your out a bit. Allow a good two to three hours to get from the front to the back. Definitely a dry day activity."
"the palace is big, and to explore every available attraction, be prepared to spend at least 1 full day ( attraction close around 6.30pm)

be aware of touts when you exit the museum. do not go to any attractions with them."
"If you are with a tour group you will be rushed thru but that has to happen to get from the entry to exit. Next time I will go solo armed with my camera and not be in so much of a rush.
The place is amazing but so much walking a lot of the elderly in our group struggled a bit.

The history is one that needs to be seen and learned. The architecture is certainly different and worth a visit."
"This place is rich of history and it's a most if your in Beijing, go with a guide so you here all the stories."
A Beijing must see...but it is so massive you become a little 'palaced out' by the time you have entered the umpteenth square and seen the next part of the palace!
"Very Amazing.. very beautiful. everything is just what i expected from watching tv series. student card got discounted price.

you need to spend whole day here, especially if you get in from Tian An Men

Beware being scam by ""fake tour guide "" who offer a day trip to Great Wall.. they are a lot of them there.they will give you pamflets with all good ittenaries , a lot of promise with super cheap price. But all of them are Scams..only Signed to Tour agent in which they give you Contract..not Simply a Receipt. You will have to pay a lot of Extra cost and will waste your time.."
"I have been to the Forbidden City before and therefore didn't want to wait in line to go in. As I was leaving the main square in front, a woman who seemed normal and genuine approached me and wanted to practice her English. I wish I had read reviews before I went, but DO NOT talk to anyone that wants to practice their English or have tea. The bill came and I am so embarrassed to actually say how much it cost because it will make me look like a naive idiot. I didn't pay the full amount as I told her I had not enough money and no credit card, she paid the rest, but do not fall for this! It is a huge scam and you will lose in the end.
When I went in the past, I really enjoyed the grounds and the area, it is a beautiful and historic site, but I was disappointed that there are so many scammers around. It is not good for a country that wants to boost their tourism."
This place was nothing like I had imagined. The size alone is jaw dropping. A must-see when you're in Beijing!
"If there is one place you visit in Beijing, make sure it is this one. It's breath-taking and offers so much to explore. The facilities are very well maintained. There are probably thousands of people that visit the Forbidden City every day, but since it 's so big, people are all spread out so it doesn't feel overwhelmingly crowded. Don't get lost in there - it is HUGE!!!"
"Well it's true what everyone has reviewed. It's huge with many buildings ""Halls/ palaces "". You don't need a guide unless you actually want one.
We had an exceptionally difficult time shaking one off. Also beware of scammers wanting to practice their English by having you sit down at a tea shop or steer you away from your destination ( one in our group paid a pretty penny buying tea for scammers the prior day).
Even if you're not into history , you can't go to Beijing and not see the Forbidden City and the Palace museum inside.
The Royal gardens in the back has some amazing historic trees"
I took the sub from my hotel to the Forbidden City this past Monday but I forget to check if it was open - sadly it was not. I had a good walk around the area but could not go inside the Palaces. I had been there several years ago and was hoping the renovations that had been going on and hid a lot of the buildings was over and indeed it did appear to have been completed. Word of advice - don't go on a Monday unless you don't want to actually go into the area. Oh well live and learn. Still impressive and oddly people were paying for tours around the walls...... I did explores areas around the Forbidden City that were interesting on their own (but not worth the trip in the cold of January).
"Amazed by the size and condition of this attraction. If your into history, need to stop and walk through."
"One of my Three favorite places in China.
It was impressive! Huge!
You see it in the movies, you read about it, but it wa amazing to be able to walk thru the main entrance of the Forbidden City and then to realize that it is a huge city inside.
Beautiful architecture, colors ,so well kept. You really need few hours to walk around and really enjoy this place.
Great place to take pictures."
"The forbidden city was very grand and showcased China's historic culture.
The price (off peak season) of 80RNB for two was reasonable however the crowds were very large and made it difficult to actually see the thrones and other decorations in the buildings. We visited on a clear blue sky sunny day, and would recommend this if you visit as it is mostly open.
Tips: Beware of the pickpockets and scammers going in and out of the palace."
"Truly a marvel, the Forbidden City is a site you will always remember seeing. Hire a guide for a better tour and, best yet, check out a PBS or history channel show first."
The Forbidden City is huge. Hundreds of buildings. It's worth seeing but the locals burn a lot in incense there. Wear comfortable shoes because you will be walking a lot. It's a famous place so go.
We spent a day trip in the city and the history was incredible. I genuinely was surprised at the beauty that is in this area. It was all we hoped for and more.
One of my highlights of Beijing for sure. It takes a bit of time & effort including a fair bit of walking & climbing stairs but even with a metal hip I managed quite well. So much history and culture was amazing
"It's a must-see. China always conjured up visions of the exotic, mysterious and untouchable. But now it's relatively easy to go. We used a private your guide and have no regrets. He was a wealth of additional information. Allow a good 4 hours+ to see all you want. Chances are it won't be enough. Left feeling very Mulan!"
We spent quite a long time here looking at all of the gorgeous rooms. The history of the place is quite amazing and is well worth the visit
Plan to spend at least 3 or 4 hours in this interesting place. Much of it is under one small charge although a few buildings or additional museums have a small additional charge. We thought the treasures museum was worth the extra charge. Get the audio guide which provided some color and stories about the various buildings.
Amazing place! Take at least 3 - 4 hours to visit. Check the adjacent houses and spend a while in the corridors. The gardens are beautiful.
"Go to see, not full of espectations otherwise you'll not enjoy.
Very beautifull, take time do not just walk throught."
"The architecture and history behind these buildings is very interesting. There are boards which provide information alongside each building. The palace struck me to be spread over a very wide space with huge courtyards.

There are lots of parts of the palace so ensure you leave enough time if you want to see everything."
"This is a must see location. Dating from the Ming dynasty. The architecture and history combine with some amazing numerology to make this a fantastic site. I would skip the clocks and maybe even the treasures since there are other museums that have more impressive collections. There is an audio tour in multiple languages available. Even mid January there were crowds, so prepare for that. Not at all handicap accessible."
"We (2 people) paid 80y per person for the tickets and 80y pp for the audio guides. The stories on the audio guides were interesting. The mechanism however was highly frustrating. Since it's an automatic guide, it should start automatically in different areas where you pass. For me however it didn't work every time, so I missed some content. Also the content is only given once, so you must be very attentive. Being a foreigner, several people
asked to take a picture with us, this sometimes whilst the content was running. Which meant that I lost my focus and didn't remember what was said.

Regarding the site itself, it's just amazing. We walked for 5 hours in the city and tried to see as much as we could. You'll be able to find basic snacks and there was even an atm. The toilets were clean and there was even paper (halleluja:)).

We went in offseason and we only had to queu for the security checks. (2 in total). We got there by subway (qianmen east stop)."
"Wasn't really enthusiastic to see this but glad I did. To witness the grand scale of this place, and its history is an experience I will always cherish. Paid 40y using my passport to gain entry. Took a great interest in how they built the corners of the roofs. Like a jig saw of wood. Unfortunately had to drop my shoulders and force my way to take my pics at some spots, otherwise you get shoved aside lol Finished it off with a visit to the History of Clocks museum, which was a further 10y and VERY worth it. The craftsmanship and detail on display were mind blowing. Cover up tho, its very cold at this time of year."
"This is one of those must see places in everyone's lifetime. The Forbidden City is a truly remarkable cultural achievement and I would recommend getting there early as its gets extremely busy.

A great place to spend the day and absorb the history of China."
We were lucky to visit the Forbidden City on a clear blue sky on 23 December 2016 when just a few days ago Beijing was shrouded with smog. The place was huge and thanks to our local tour guide Daniel who was able to explain to us the various significant historical sections of the Forbidden City as how it was utilised in the past which make the tour more interesitng and informative.
"It was my second time to visit the forbidden city, I did not like it few years ago, but when I was there this time, I was very much enjoyed, I felt very peaceful in the forbidden city, the architecture style was amazing, worth to go!"
The Forbidden City is very large yet very beautiful-there is so much to see and you can really feel the culture of China. Be sure to enter the Palace Museum as we almost missed it out. Don't just stay on the outside portion. This is very doable even without a tour.
"Well worth a visit if in Beijing. This place is HUGE! You could spend days here exploring every building. We got the audio tour headphones and they mostly worked, but sometimes didn't pick up the location you were at. Go early before the big crowds get there and plan ahead for pickup as you walk through from one entrance to the other. overall we were very impressed with the size and history of this location."
A place that most people are unaware of but worth the visit. I enjoyed the history and most of all small crowds. Very interesting place to see if you have a few hours.
"Through and not so easy to find doorway, we saw some relics that survived from the palace days of the last emperor. They were exquisite but it looked live very few people took advantage of this opportunity."
"This places gives a full history of Chinese culture, both in terms of architecture and custom.

It is super interesting and is very well done, in terms of the signage and information. We did not have a guide and were able to still fully enjoy the experience and learn about the different buildings, of which there were many.

The space is huge, mind boggling that the area takes up such a huge area - it goes on and on and on.

A must see if you are in Beijing."
"We walked from our hotel and came across this tourist spot not realising it was the Forbidden City. Sounds daft, but there were no signs other than Palace Museum identifying what. It was. It was however huge and had a moat around it and there were no crowds, so we went in. It was OK. Apart from the size which was spectacular, everything else was just average. We walked right through from end to end and only when we reached a gift shop at the very end did we realise where we were. I was particularly underwhelmed, having expected lavish surroundings etc."
"This was by far the biggest palace residence for the royal emperor family, with nearly 10,000 rooms. It is the symbol of ancient China. You need a good tour"
"We visited the Forbidden City on January 1, 2017 as part of a private tour with Travel China Guide. The architecture and views are amazing. The history is rich and property is quite expansive. We only spent 2 hours at the Forbidden City but we could have sent an entire day walking around, exploring the different buildings and temples. It was very clear from the layout that the emperor lived a very lavish lifestyle with multiple different buildings dedicated to different tasks and an expansive area for his concubine. It was quite amazing to walk through each gate and see different scenery within the city walls. This is a MUST SEE in Beijing. Plan to spend the day and not just an hour or two. It is quite beautiful and expansive."
"The outer court with its huge squares and raised halls are impressive but I particuarily liked the Inner Court and other living quarters of the emperor and concubines. Long endless passages with ornate gateways into pretty courtyards seemed to hold intrigue around each corner.
Don't forget your passport (or a photocopy) or you can't buy a ticket. And have comfortable walking shoes. There is so much here to see you really have to just choose the bits you are most interested in."
"The massive scale and history of the Forbidden City cannot be understood with words or pictures. It is massive and has incredible history to take in.

There are some attractions on second levels of buildings so make sure you don't miss them. Expect lots of people and a clean, safe environment.

Plan for a couple of hours, and there are not any bathrooms inside the City so plan accordingly."
"It's a must see in Beijing. The palace is huge, so get your walking shoes on. You will be tired after walking through the palace, but it's totally worth it."
"You can easily get lost in the forbidden city. Some areas are large expanses of big squares. So glad we were able to go such a surprised at how different the various areas looked. Impressive buildings, temples, squares!"
Stop over for 3 days. This did not disappoint. Allow most of a day to do this tour properly and make sure you have good walking shoes.
"A very busy place, and popular with locals and tourists alike. First impressions weren't great as I was walking against the tide in the under-the-road tunnel with thousands going the other way ! But all got better on the other side. A fantastic place to visit, and such amazing history. Just wish I had more time to explore it all"
"I wasn't prepared for the shear size of this ancient site. Just when you think you've seen it all you take yet another passageway leading you to another huge area.
The colours are unbelievable , with each tiny detail on a roof a work of art in itself.
There are brillient imperial colours of blue, red and yellow.
We spent a couple of hours roaming around , as jet lagged as we were since this was our first day."
Unfortunately the day we went it was very hot and a public holiday in China so was very busy. You can hire a tour guide there or hire headset which talks you through the different sections of the Palace. The story of the Emperor and Forbidden city is fascinating.
"This is a large and very interesting complex. Imagine living outside the walls and wondering who lives inside, Now is your chance to enter the Forbidden City and to see how the Emperor lives. The buildings are well restored and it is amazing to walk around this very historic place. December is cold though so dress warmly. Also worth visiting the neighbouring hill 'Jingshan Park' (ignore the tuk tuk drivers offering you tours) to look down n the city to really get an impression of how big it is."
One hour driving from the airport. Perfect to visit between flights. Better book a trip before and the driver will be waiting at arrivals regardless the time of your flight.
"Felt the spirit of forbidden city. No matter which way you turn, an amazing photo opportunity awaits. The architectural detail is simply astoundingly beautiful. The visit itself will take at least a half day to see it properly, and you could easily spend a full day here."
We were led by our tour guide on this massive site. The amount of human labor to construct this is unbelievable and to be appreciated.
"the tour guide is amazing and educative
Thank you so Much China Highlights for the escort
the place is Tully Amazing Forbidden City is the perfect place and very worth visiting."
"A must visit that gives you an amazing feeling of the enormous achitecture of the Chinese History. You should give yourself at least 3 to 4 hours to enjoy this massive palace. One could feel the rich culture and history in every chamber and hall. The art, craftmanship and detailed arrangement of the entire site allows you to live your imagination through the past and I would say it was an extraordinary experience for myself.
The only set back was that some small room and hall was converted to souvenir stores and other retail store.
Overall an amazing experience."
here is my review for the Forbidden City - the Palace Museum: i is a must see and very worth visiting.
"I'm from Beijing, and since no locals in their right minds would come visit the forbidden city, the last time I visited must've been at least 25 years ago on a school trip. My boyfriend is not Chinese, and this being his first trip to Beijing, I decided to take him here. Unfortunately it was a completely unpleasant, physically exhausting, and mentally unrewarding experience. I would never do it again. First thing is the unrelenting crowds. Of course when in China you must be used to crowds, but as it was a Tuesday morning in the middle of September with schools in session and no public holiday, I can't even imagine how crowded it must be on weekends or during holidays. That being said, a friend of mine said she went in the late afternoon when it was about closing time, and the place was completely empty so she was able to enjoy it and take many good pictures. Second thing is the seemingly random exhibitions that don't have a cohesive theme, charge extra for tickets, lie right in the middle of the walking route with no way to bypass them (since the majority of the alleys and courtyards are roped off), and leave you unimpressed and annoyed. I suppose it's not exactly the museum's fault that the ""best"" treasures were taken by the Kuomintang to Taipei. But please at least show some respect for people's time by putting together a thoughtful exhibit and give people a choice to bypass. Third thing is the physical stamina required for the visit - there're no trees along the walking route (this is the design of the palace so can't be changed) and not many places one can sit and rest (can be improved upon). Just come prepared - on this day we logged more than 20000 steps on our pedometers.

With all that said, this is still a majestic place. It's just that the tourists' experience leaves much to be desired. If you must go, go on a non-holiday in the late afternoon, take the audio guide (it's reasonable), don't expect too much from the exhibitions and just try to soak it in. For me, I'd rather spend my 20000 steps on the summer palace or the temple of heaven."
Truly amazing. This was my second visit. The first time I didn't have a guide and this time I did. Good either way. If you are into the history bone up or get a guide in advance. We used Catherine Lu tours. Highly recommended.
"If you have watched any of the period dramas featuring the Forbidden City, you would feel underwhelmed by the palace. The entire palace sits on an impressive plot of land which not all are opened to public. It is still a must-visit.

We hired a guide which completed our tour in 2 hours. Pretty meaningless if you walk without a guide, so I recommend hiring one. We paid 180RMB for 4pax, they helped us to skip the queue to get tickets. 2hours was a bit rushed, so you might want to negotiate with the guide and pay a little more. The crowd without guides will try to tag along and sometimes, going nearer to the guide than you are, just let the guide know you are not comfortable with that.

NOTE: You need proof of identification to purchase tickets so remember your passport."
The Forbidden City is so huge it is advised to cater a whole day to visit the various halls and temples to understand the customs and formalities of the Chinese Royal family back in the days!
One of the historical places that one must not miss in Beijing. Amazing city within city. Lots of walking and up and down steps. Moat around it gives it a great view.
"When you plan to visit forbidden city, do remember to put on comfortable shoes as you will have to walk a lot. You will enter from one side and exit at the other so advise your driver accordingly. The visit forbidden city should started from tianmen square after visiting chairman Mao's tomb, in my opinion."
"The best place ever seen.... So big.. Best to take photo, from the entrance & all the room. First time see the chair where the emperor sit..."
a very interesting bulding but be aware if the guards see cameras they will be confiscated as not pictures are allowed to be taken inside
"Compared to the earlier excitement before the visit, the Forbidden city was ok. The entire palace is a great historical architecture no doubt, but you may get bored after going thru 2-3 gates. Too many tourists were around to take the scenic pitures. Too many survenir stores on side allays, allof them so much alike. After the visit, i felt that observing the entire Forbidden city view from the tower rather than strolling down there was worth to spend money & time."
This is just an incredible place with so much history that to do it justice you have to spend a day here. We paid for the audio guides and they were great. Last time I was here was before the Olympics and renovations closed many parts. Now it`s mostly fully open and just a wonderful place
"I visited on a summer saturday, and it felt like half the population of China was there with me. Like many other places in Beijing, you have to go through a line to access the next line: in this case it was security check, purchase ticket, another security check and finally admission. At which point you realize the entryways of the Forbidden City were not designed for the number of visitors they are asked to accomodate. Thankfully admissions are capped at 80,000 (yes eighty thousands) per day. The southern half, monumental, provides no shade but in the archways. Drinking water is available (for a fee) at several vending stations. A lot of the grounds are closed to the public, making the open sections even more crowded. The private grounds are a maze of small courtyards and pavilions enclosed by tall walls. Red is the dominant color for all exposed surfaces.
Near the northwest corner of the monumental section is a group of buddhist temples: the only trees (except for those in the garden at the extreme north of the compound) can be found here, together with a slight breeze.
If you feel overheating head for the pavilions housing the display of ancient bronzes: they are the only A/C structures around, but be prepared to elbow (or be elbowed by) several visitors to get a spot neat the A/C vent.
Well worth the time and price of the admission, but do not visit during a hot afternoon"
"This is vast and impressive. There are many things to observe and history to learn. This is simply something you should see. It could potentially take a few hours, but it is worth it. Be sure to include Jingshan Park and Tiananmen Sqaure (they sandwich the Forbidden city, Jingshan Park on the South, and Tiananmen on the North)."
"Obviously this is a top destination in China, simply breathtaking! I spent a good part of a day in there and I think it should be enough for a good looks around. Most importantly I enjoyed every second of it."
"The Forbidden City is very huge inside, you cannot complete it in one day. The architecture of the buildings are impressive but the only set back is you are not allowed to go into the buildings and can only view the interior from outside."
"This was my 2nd visit, and the first with the family. I'm never bored of this place.
Its a shame that most of the fittings and decorations seemed to have been looted during the warlord years in the early days of the Chinese Republic (post-1912), and the interior of the palace buildings seem too empty except for the thrones and brass/copper vessels and large objects. To properly scour the whole place, you'll probably need 2 -3 solid days. English audio guide tapes are available for rent at the main entrance. Go during winter as the warmer months will see much larger crowds and you don't want to have to jostle for space for good photos or que with the locals."
"I've visited in June and in December. In June the place was so noisy, busy and crowded it was hard to enjoy. I've just been back in December and it was relatively quiet and a lot more enjoyable. I was lucky that the sky was clear and the light wa good. That can't be guaranteed at any time and doesn't happen often in winter."
Excellent palce to visit in early morning otherwise you will be drowned in the tourisits thronging the location. I did have to struggle with taking pictures like any other due to the rush. Support staff and ticket counter is helpful.
"Forbidden city is the must see of Beijing. Amazing palaces and intriguing complex. With an audio guide (or even a tour guide for 40 rmb the place will speak to you far more. Adding 10 yuan for the treasure museum was worth it to me, as the collection of treasures is amazing. I planned a full day and did not even have time to go to the bell and watch museum. All that being said, why not 5 star? Well, part of the palaces that should be open were closed. It's getting very commercial and a microwave hamburger is not my food of choice. It starts to feel like an amusement park instead of a museum, and people treat it as such. And that makes me deduct a star. As it could be top notch. It is not to me now."
"If you had the choose only one thing to see in Beijing this would be it. Spare one day to visit the forbidden city to ensure you visit every temple on the east and west side. You can easily spend 4 hours in there, but it can also be visited in less time, omitting all those little temples and sticking to the main ones if time is a constraint for you. Keep in mind that this place is not open on Mondays!"
"There are many entrances/exit in this palace. The main one where you can get tickets is at Tian An Men Square so make sure you drop off at the main entrance. If not, there are paid rides which can bring you to the main entrance as you would want to conserve your energy for the walking tour within the very big palace. There are guides provided at a fee, but they do not offer English speaking guide. The information is mostly on historical background and ancient Chinese architectural design & purpose of the various courts. We walked around the various court fronts but we cannot enter the interior of the domestic court. I feel that there is much repetition in the Forbidden City tour information if one only gets to see the exterior. However, one section is converted into a walk-in museum known as the 珍宝馆 which requires entry tickets which showcase the treasures in the palace. Nevertheless, the guide we had is very knowledgable and the tour has given us insights on how Chinese cultural beliefs and influence of Feng Shui (geomancy) have been translated into the architectural design."
"The forbidden city is overwhelmed with tourists in a way that makes seeing it without getting run over difficult. If it was better managed, organized, and the crowd controlled, it would be excellent."
"I remember visiting the Forbidden Palace when I was little, and always remembered it as being a grand and remarkable feat of work. Today that seems not to be the case.

It's certainly somewhere to visit if you are planning on staying in Beijing for only a few days, but make sure you buy your tickets online, unless you are prepared to stand in the awfully long queues, THEN the queue to go through security. Also be aware that tickets are timed and that you have to go through Tiananmen Square in order to reach the Palace, by which I mean you have to go through about four rows of security.

Once inside the actual palace, there isn't actually a lot left to see-it's all mainly been moved out apart until just the infrastructure is left. There are also very few signboards explaining anything, and where there are these boards due to their rarity they are completely crowded. Any point of interest is completely covered with people and you can never actually see what everyone is so intent on taking a picture of. There are no maps or leaflets, and the guides that are usually hanging around saying that they'll give you a 'bargain' are really just cheapskates hoping to make a profit off of tourists. If you would like a guide you should get someone you trust and know does the job well instead of at the site. They also forget to mention the large amount of walking required to see the large grounds, as well as the very few toilet facilities.

Once again, I'm not saying don't go-it is still a pretty important part of China's history and culture, and is not to be missed. I'm just saying don't get your hopes up."
I'm a traveller from Australia. I thoroughly enjoyed this. I get extremely enthralled by historical structures where you can see the history as you walk through. This actually reminded me of the edinburgh castle for those who have been!
"This place is very large and will involve walking over 2 hours. It was exciting to be in a structure that is very old, and it is laid out so well. Plan to go early in the morning as there will be thousands of people lining up to enter this amazing place. We were impressed by the grandeur and the beauty of the palace and the forbidden city. We did it in one day but you could certainly take 2 to 3 days to properly see everything. I would saw that it is as exciting as The Great Wall was for us. You can get there using probably the best subway system that we have used. Amazing experience for my wife and I. We have travelled to many countries in the world but coming to Beijing was the biggest surprise . The people are just amazing, the younger people speak fluent English . You must travel to this city to see its treasures, you will not regret it."
Visit China without being in Beijing is like you never been in China. But the most important thing to understand the spirit of China you must look and feel the spirit of forbidden city. You can travel all day long.
"Until you actually experience the Forbidden City first-hand, it's impossible to fully appreciate its sheer scale, beauty, and complexity. Despite its size, the City is jam packed with Chinese and foreign visitors, so rule number one should be to get there early. The visit itself will take at least a half day to see it properly, and you could easily spend a full day here. While not necessary, it might also help to do the tour with a knowledgable guide to fully understand what you are seeing. After purchasing admission at the Tiananmen entrance, the tour itself proceeds North through a seemingly never-ending series of vast courtyards broken up by various temples and palaces. No matter which way you turn, an amazing photo opportunity awaits. The architectural detail is simply astoundingly beautiful. The only drawback from my visit was the pickpocket who succeeded in extracting my wallet from my buttoned back pocket as we exited the last gate. Luckily, I thought he was getting a little too close and turned to confront him, where he promptly dropped my wallet and fled. I didn't even know he had gotten my wallet out until a helpful Chinese lady pointed to it laying on the ground. Be advised."
"The square leading up to the palace is extremely cold with gusts of wind and nothing to block it, but as soon as you pass through the walls, it gets much warmer. You can easily get lost in the forbidden city. Some areas are large expanses of big squares, but when you get further in, the living quarters seem to be much more confined. I was actually surprised at how different the various areas looked. Some were fairly sparse without any art, or architecture to note. Other areas seem to be filled with artifacts on display, sitting areas, and beautiful gardens. So glad we were able to go."
"The Forbidden city was planned to be my highlight in Beijing. I went to it with high expectations. It lived up to each one. A massive place with plenty of rooms. I understand many people would find it repetitive however, as many buildings looked identical to one another. When I visited I had just watched a movie about the Palace, spiking my interest in its history. If you visit I recommend watching ""The Last Emperor"" in order to see some of he history and ceremonies held here."
"I've been to the Forbidden City twice, and it is a great place to visit in China. It is enormous so leave yourself enough time. Getting there early is wise, since it does get very busy and crowded especially on the weekend. There is a security line to get in that can take up to 1.5 hours, so be prepared. Bring water and snacks. You can also buy food and drinks inside. Traveling in March 2014 and September 2016."
"WOW! Just WOW! Ofcourse, a must visit while in Beijing! But it is so worth it! Impressive buildings, temples, squares! We were there in winter time so not that crowded. Take ur time to stroll around the hundreds of buildings and squares. One of the top monuments in the world!"
"Only planned for a couple of hours for the visit, but end up being a day trip. Interesting place and lots to see. Take time to visit the surrounding area such as the jingshan park across the road for an aerial view of the Palace. Looks exactly the same as picture on the postcard."
"You can visit some exhibitions, plus the courtyard & rooms. It is a good place to learn Chinese traditional architecture, courtyard design, also a good place to learn Chinese culture. You can also take wonderful pictures of this great palace."
"I have been to Beijing twice - once during Golden week in May and again in December. Yes it's cold in December but the significantly lower number of visitors made all attractions so easy to get around and appreciate. The Forbidden City is a must - crowded or not, it's so worth it! Get an audio guide - these are GPS guided so it apparently knows where you are to give appropriate information. This is kind of true - but the information is delivered before you get there so it can be a little confusing. Do see the 9 Dragons Wall - its special & off to the side. Pause the audio guide whilst you look around, walk to the next courtyard and press play & then you might not have the confusion of it talking about something you haven't yet seen.

A couple of times we went into shops to warm up & I can tell you that they stocked different things. So if you see a souvenir that you like, buy it then as it probably won't be at the shop at the end. I thought the prices were really reasonable too.

Even a fast walk from Tienanmen Square to the other side of the Forbidden City is 2.5 hours and you won't really be looking in the exhibitions at that pace. If you want to look at the excellent clock exhibit or jade exhibit, allow 4 hours or half the day."
"Visited the Forbidden City in November 2016 when Beijing fell into a cold snap and temperatures were sub zero, but it was still absolutely beautiful to see. A must see on a trip to Beijing. Fantastic history and culture to be experienced at the Forbidden City. Spend a minimum of half day here to make it worth it. It takes quite some time to walk through and see all the palaces."
The forbidden city is one of the most popular tourist destinations! Everyone should visit the palace however it is a little monotonous because the temples and the architecture repeats and you got the impression that everything looks the same. All in all the trip was ok!
"If you have limited time and had to choose then go to the palace museum. If you have little knowledge of Chinese history, hire a qualified guide at the same booth where you rent the audio guide. If not ask your hotel concierge. I have used both an audio and human guide. While it is easy to move around with the audio guide , you get a more in depth explanation with a personal guide ( cf a group tour guide ) . Of course, if it's not history you are after, then the audio guide is sufficient and allows you to focus on taking great pictures at leisure. If you have to me, do visit the museum of clocks and museum of treasures (both additional fees but worth it). Different strokes for different folks though."
"If your visiting Beijing you can't miss the Forbidden City! We walked across from Wangfujing street (15 mins) and you are funneled into a security check before you enter the main entrance to Tiananmen Square. We visited in December so there were less tourist but still busy. As you walk towards the Palace entrance you must buy your tickets on the left. Word of Warning....bring your passport!! They need your Passport to issue you a ticket. Can't get in without it. Also, worth spending the 40 RMB for the interactive audio. We got one for the group which was good for one person to relay what we were looking at. Lots of info in the audio. Prepare for lots of walking and stairs. You enter at the South side and exit at the North side of the Palace. If it's cold the gift shop half way in the tour is a good place to warm up. Lots of history and the shear size of the Palace and grounds is worth the admission."
"The hotel we stayed in was quite close to the Forbidden City and we decided to go over and spend an afternoon there

It was December and therefore while the entry itself was crowded due to security checks, the venue itself was fairly empty.

The place is absolutely huge and after a while one gate looks pretty much like another.

When we went, we had to exit the other end of the attraction which meant a taxi ride back to the original entrance."
"The best advice I could offer is to arrive early. We took the subway line 2 to Qianmen station, as it's conveniently located and close to the entrance of the Forbidden City. Make sure you take Exit A and walk South, it will lead you straight to the Meridian Gate. The entry fee is between CNY40-60 depending what time of the year you visit, and there is an additional fee of CNY10 to access certain rooms. Also note that this place is huge. You could spend hours exploring this place, so make sure you have enough time.

When we went, we didn't use a guide as most of the signs were in English and we had background knowledge of the area.

In the Forbidden City, there are three main halls. The Hall of Supreme Harmony is the biggest structure. This structure was used to celebrate special occasions. Inside the hall is an impressive throne.

Behind the Hall of Supreme Harmony is the Hall of Middle Harmony and the Hall of Preserving Harmony. Both were very impressive, but the Hall of Supreme Harmony is definitely the most impressive of the structures.

Once you have seen the three main halls, I would recommend having a walk around and choosing locations which interest you. Some of the lesser room include the Treasure Gallery, the Nine Dragon Screen and the Clock Exhibition Hall. These rooms are filled to the brim with curiosities. Leave enough time to get lost and meander through the grounds. There are 9999 rooms in total in the Museum grounds, so be sure to choose wisely!"
"was everything you ever read about it truly breathtaking
the line to enter was relatively short,, compared to hours of waiting during the high season
this time of year there were very few visitors so you could really see just how magnificent the complex is"
"Visited on a day when the pollution levels were high, so the view was not great, but the new areas that were opened (not having visited since 2007), were fascinating. Its a little hassle to have to queue through security before getting to the Forbidden city, so do get there early."
"We enjoyed or visit to the forbidden city. The area is huge and requires a lot of walking. We had a stroller which wasn't very useful due to the uneven rocks on the floor- not a big deal for us since our boys weren't that tired , but perhaps it could affect other families more.

The only disappointment was that you couldn't go into a lot of the rooms- you could just look on from the windows."
This should be in your bucket list if you come to Beijing. It's massive so be ready to walk. Beware of art scammers who will try and talk you into buying paintings.
"Overall the Forbidden City is an interesting and historical place and worth a visit.
Good idea to get a guide once inside the grounds, they are fairly cheap and the guides are pretty knowledgeable, but then again I guess they have to be :)
My tour of the Forbidden city lasted a few hours and as I went in winter I decided I needed a cup of tea.
Once outside the walls I was walking behind two ladies one of which fell in the snow, I asked if she was ok? Anyway we ended up chatting and going for tea together in a place of their choosing, very pushy to buy more drinks and food. I had read about something like this on the internet before I traveled so asked for the bill and yes the bill came to nearly 100 dollars for 3 cups of tea!!! I refused to pay and the waiter became quite aggressive and raising his voice at me I just walked out anyway and refused to pay, they followed me into the street but there was a policeman close by so I just stood next to him and they then returned to their scam cafe. The whole experience was a scam aimed at relieving tourists of their hard earned cash!!!
Watch out for these people!!"
"Finger painting in Forbidden City. Finger painting is a rare genre, created in the Qing Dynasty (1644-1911) by Guangdong artists Gao Qipei and Gao Fenghan, in which painters uses their fingers instead of a brush to paint images and write Chinese characters on the rice paper with Chinese ink. It has been practiced and advanced in the last century by master painters such as Pan Tianshou and Li Kuchan.

We were fortunate to have a known finger painter show us the techniques of the art. There lots of huge hanging landscape scrolls, hand scrolls of flowers-and-birds paintings, and calligraphic pieces that he has created. I bought one and the painter is kind enough to make it personalized and even write my name on the painting itself. Awesome!!!!"
"What an amazing place, the history and architecture is incredible. Highly recommend getting a tour guide. We used Tour-Beijing.com and our brilliant guide was Jackie Shen."
"The Forbidden City with it's courtyard after courtyard, emperors palace, and concubine quarters goes on forever. Be sure to learn about it's history from a guide or brochures at the gift shop."
"Who knew there was so much behind the walls to see. Allow plenty of time to see it all, some of it is a bit samey but allow time to see the garden at the end on the way out"
Liked the architecture but had to walk a lot as its located far from subway. Not much food or washroom facilities inside.
"The Forbidden City is a huge series of buildings that appear to go and on. There are gardens as well, but the sheer scale of the thing is amazing. Well worth a visit."
"We were very lucky with the weather on our visit - though cold the wind blew away a lot of Beijing pollution and blue skies made the experience even more wonderful.
Pay the small amount extra for a ticket to the treasure gallery as it admits you to less crowded pavilions and the opera theatre as well as all the gold and jade you could look at in one day.
with in the grounds are a few tea shop but no substantial food so you may need to take a few supplies as you could easily and happily spend several hours wandering through the grounds.
I image that it could become a terrible crush during the high season as they have a maximum daily entry of 80,000!
Go - you won't regret it."
"The Museum and the Forbidden City are truly spectacular, the carvings, the architecture, the ambience of the place are breathtaking. Each gate that you go through has an amazing story and each courtyard tells a different tale even down to the large water containers. The gardens at the end make the journey worthwhile."
This area is immense and very crowded so in some places you are walking shoulder to shoulder with the multitudes. It is very interesting however difficult to get to see inside the rooms as there are so many people. A must see but disappointing due to the crowds.
"The scale of the Forbidden City is impressive, but it is lacking character, and atmosphere, and the courtyards are repetitive - you walk into 3 or 4 large squares one after the other which look remarkably similar to the last one. We came with a guide, which helped explain what were seeing, but we weren't hugely impressed (I rated every other Beijing attraction a 5). This place is a must see for every visitor to Beijing, but don't be disappointed if it doesn't quite reach your expectations."
Expecting a lot more than what was there. It is a must see but you can walk through it and be a bit disappointed. Make sure you go to the park North of the walls and walk up the hill. (This does cost to get into the park.) You will be able to see the whole Forbidden City from up there.
When you walk through the forbidden city knowing its history it will make you feel like you experience what was like living there.
"The moat around the city is beautiful and the structures themselves give a true feel of ancient China. However, I was expecting there would be more to see. The city is quite bare and the only exibitions are some artifacts inside the buildings which you can only see from the entrance and not go further in the room."
"How could you go to Rome and not see the Vatican? Well, not seeing the Forbidden City while in China, or the Great Wall, would be the same mistake. It is full of history and culture along with being so beautiful. A real highlight of our trip!"
"This is a must see in Beijing and is something special. It covers a huge area and requires a lot of walking, albeit on the level. As you enter each ""layer"" it just gets better and better. The buildings are spectacular and the colours amazing. Well worth visiting"
Definitely have to plan this on your trip as the architecture is truly amazing and walking inside you feel submerged within the culture. It's really a different world when you enter in; very quiet and secluded.
"Definitely an all-day walk around is best. Keep in mind that all the important, imperial buildings ran in a continuous line from the front gate to the back gate. The garden at the very back was beautiful.

I was there many years ago and I understand the crowds are unbearable now. Maybe you can avoid some by getting off that straight line path. Quarters for the concubines and eunuchs were also fascinating. Advise to do a little self study before you go so you know what you are seeing."
Didn't have the best tour guide so learned very little about the Forbidden City while walking the grounds. Overall a must see but wish we would have known more as we visited. Do your research so you can enjoy what you are seeing more or opt for an audio tour
"The forbidden city is the largest ancient palatial structure in the world. That itself is reason enough for you to visit.

Wear comfortable shoes and warm clothes as exploring the 135 acre complex would entail a long walk.

With many gates (archways) leading to halls , the crimson and gray complex houses 9000+ rooms.

Entrance is from the road facing Tianmen Square. A fee is chargeable with a discount for senior citizens. A government issued photo ID card is a must.

An audio guide linked to GPS gives you the freedom to wander at your pace and select the path based on time availability.

There are a few stores which serve hot/cold drinks and some snacks. If going with children would be better to carry some food.

The grandeur of the grand palace is must see while at Beijing."
If you ever in Beijing this is one of the places you have to go to. It is absolutely gorgeous and just so amazing to imagine all the royalty that once lived and ruled there. Its almost overwhelming with its sheer size and open courtyard areas. They do offer little headsets that tell you different information but we opted to have a tour guide instead and it felt more fun and interesting that way.
"We absolutely loved visiting the Forbidden City and the museum. Wow, it just goes on and on..... Unbelievable. Fascinating to learn all about the history as well. We bought a painting in the museum store from the artist."
"If this is your first time, just take your time to marvel at one of the world's greats, just improving with time (as more of it was just recently accessible), there's the basic walk smack through the middle which will take a good 2hours already. lf you are a little more adventurous and are not with a group, it is easy to find further 'treasures' in its vast grounds. Everyone has favourites, there is just too much to mention all... if l had to pick one would suggest the Clocks museum as a highly recommended for its international value and endless content. There is just too much to see, throw a coin and make a wish to be back again"
Even wit a temperaturen of minus one It is An amazing place to Be. If you are plus 60 you Get a reduction on tour ticket. My personel guide told me that the price is NOT fixed. The special clock museum has a lot of European pieces. Exceptional but a bit dusty. Take minimum half a day.
"Of course, you have to visit this place if you go to Beijing. It is very interesting and the idea that so many dead emperors would hate it that you're there is fun. But in the end it's a massive swarm of swaying selfie sticks. Don't get your hopes up."
"What I liked about this place was it gave me a good glimpse of Chinese culture. Add to that, what surprised me the most that every single detail was made for a reason. Must visit place"
"Exactly: regardless of whether you're interested in history, China,, art or architecture, you will find everything in here. Chose a week day and avoid crowds if possible and plan on wandering at a slow pace to absorb the detail. I was fascinating with the ornaments, architecture and garden areas which will give you plenty reason to reflect on the space and social history."
great if this is your thing but it is a lot of in depth information to take in bearing in mind that it takes about half a day to walk through the entire place anyway
"It, and Great Wall, are why you go to Beijing!
Great that it has survived the political machinations over centuries and been kept in great repair.
Be ready for crowds, watch your belongings and passports, take water, and enjoy.
It can close at short notice due to visiting dignitary, or cleaning, or just because, so be flexible in itinerary! We had to change day planned!"
"A must see when you visit Beijing. If you go on a clear day it is just beautiful. Could definitely take a picnic. This would be ideal for people of any age, and I will definitely come back on my next trip"
"Whether you're pro or anti-monarchy shouldn't matter when choosing to see this because so much of China's history is contained in this gigantic area. It'd literally take days to get through every inch of the City, and for this reason it's like a Palace Museum. However, you can set your own pace as you weave through the countless Halls where royalty rested, stayed and played. Arrive early to avoid the swarms of people and if you're a history buff then be sure to hire an audio guide for 40RMB followed by a viewing of the Oscar-winning 1987 classic, The Last Emperor. Allocate around 3 hours for the Tiananmen Square and Jingshan Park (where you can get amazing views), which can be bundled together, and for any delays with security checks."
"Many, many chances to take detailed photos. The architecture is amazing. The history of the palace is very interesting and should be read before visiting to help appreciate it."
This was a great place to visit to appreciate the architecture as well as the culture that formed and shaped the Chinese history. It was very impressive. I would recommend visiting in the spring when the weather is more appropriate for spending lots of time outside.
"The sheer magnitude and intricacy of the Forbidden City is astonishing. A seemingly endless progression of courtyards with throne rooms occupies the center aisle while a warren of smaller palaces, halls and gardens are on either side....plus the various museums. It takes a while to get acclimatized and to begin to notice some of the intricacies of the place (for example, look at the roofs, the rafters and the stone stairways).

Wandering through the 'support' buildings (the Treasury, the retired emperor villas and gardens, the music hall, etc.) is quite an undertaking. Many of the pieces of arts & crafts in the Treasury are astounding....the quality and craftsmanship.

Definitely a place where one should prepare for the visit beforehand.

To the right of the main entrance (about 100 meters to the west) is the entrance to the emperors temple. It requires a separate admission, but it is worth the visit as the temples are magnificent and there are no crowds. I was there on a sunny, nearly smog-free day.....an added bonus were all of the brides having their pictures taken in the various courtyards. Also, this section has a long, tree lined walkway with a huge collection of peonies (as in 100's and 100's of them)....probably well worth a visit in May when they are in bloom.

I wish that I had made time for a second visit.

Arrive early as the lines to go through security and then to get into the ticket purchase area can stretch for many blocks.....I was early and still waited in line over 30 minutes."
"The Emperor had a huge home. No wonder it is called a city there are buildings, courtyards, squares and streets for kms in any direction. All the administrators and government people lived and worked in the grounds but only the upper echelons got invited within the inner walls. Then they may be housed in an apartment for days, weeks or months until the Emperor saw fit to see them. It is not regal and full of art and riches like a European Palace but it is regal in scale and the design. Well worth the visit.
Also it's proximity to Tienamin Square means you are able to visit both on the same day."
"The Forbidden City is an amazing attraction wether the sky is polluted or not. After learning about the city in school, it was pretty surreal to see it in person and was completely blown away by the actual size. It's massive! I would totally believe it if someone told me they got lost in there. **On a side note - Beware of tourist traps upon exiting and don't accept rides from anyone claiming it's only 3 yuan to the subway. That 3 yuan will quickly become 300 yuan and you'll find yourself in an alleyway far away from any subway with men blocking each exit. I was lucky enough to escape without paying but others may not be so lucky."
"Reservation online is a must , to avoid the long queue. Try to find no-busy time (very difficult ). So sunny day is preferred for a perfect picture."
"We traveled here with Adele, from Wild Great Wall and loved our tour of the beautiful palace. We arrived early, around 7:45 am and had the place almost to ourselves, a rarity in a city of 21 million people! Learned so much from our tour guide and took in the incredible scenery. I was amazed by the level of detail that went into every aspect of the architecture, especially the ceilings and the roofs of each building, spectacular."
Located at the heart of Beijing. This place is spread in large area. Can find ancient Chinese architecture.
An interesting to go with some great architecture to see. With the attention to detail still apparent it has been preserved in a great way. If you are in Beijing i would recommend a visit!
"This was my second time at the Forbidden City, and I did it at a more leisurely pace this time, really taking in the details, and trying to get into each building, and learn more about the historical site. Going early in the morning was ideal - I definitely avoided the crowds that were swarming in as I was leaving and took the #1 bus back to the entrance. I strolled through several of the gift shops. In one of them a woman invited me to a room with an ""art exhibit"" with works, she claimed, by university students. The one piece that struck my eye immediately I went back and purchased, only to have the woman pressure me into another ""hand embroidered"" piece that I knew I should not have purchased. I take full responsibility for caving to the high pressure, but on returning to my hotel and showing it to friends, they all agreed I was ripped off. It was definitely machine sewn. It is nice, but definitely not worth what I paid. My fault, but learn from my mistake! Don't give in to the pressure... walk away. I had done that many, many times on this trip, but got caught this time."
We visited on a Sunday and the crowds were oppressive. If we come back we'll visit on a week day and later in the day.
"The palace is absolutely a wonder, gardens are quiet and very relaxing and I can only imagine the heaven they should be in spring and summer. The whole construction is huge and impressive, no one should miss it when coming to Beijing. There is a bit of queue at the entrace (I visite din December, on a Tuesday) but if you visit in summer or week ends I am sure the amount of people is something Europeans are NOT used to .....Be careful though.....when you finish the visit , just right at the exit on the opposit side of Tien namen square, there is the usual bunch of people trying to sell you things or services . Be VERY careful if catching a two seat car (rickshaw) with a driver, one in particular is a robber, I have his number and PICTURE. I tried to report to police but ...well Cina is not Switzerland.....but watch out , he trades Belorussian money instead of RMB and he is a CROOK"
"TLDR: check it out if you have time, pay for the palace museum ticket because it's worth it, prepare to walk a lot. Great place for selfies

I was in Beijing for 15 hours and decided to leave the airport for some sightseeing. Temperatures was decent, a little bit chilly and there was alot of smog from that I can see (or what I couldn't see). Due to the inability to speak Chinese, It was moderately tough to get around but luckily I found a few light English speaker that was able to help me. It took about an hour and a half or so from PEK to the forbidden city, There is a security that you'll have to go through, but the line was relatively quick. My first impression of it from the outside was that it wasn't unique. It wasn't necessarily any different than the palace in Seoul beside the huge face portrait of Mao. It all changes when I went in. Like a kid unwrapping presents on Christmas Day, each gate was a new experience and you learned just how big and massive the place is, interior designs are fantastic and it's a shame that you can't go inside each preserved traditional Chinese architecture. It took me about 4 hours but I still couldn't visit all of it (mostly due to the fact that I took so many pictures) but anyway in conclusion the place is massive and beautiful, 40 rmb to get inside and definitely China go there early to skip the line."
good experience but it was super crowed.. the place is gigantic and after a while it started to not be so spectacular as your first impression.. we got bored quick as the crowds kept us from truly enjoying the true history of this once magical place.
Touring through the Forbidden City is a unique experience. You just imagine all of the history that has taken place here. Be prepared for crowds..Lots of pushy people but take your time and you'll see everything you want.
I thoroughly enjoyed going to the forbidden city. Another thing I can now cross off The Bucket List. There is a lot of walking involved but really worth the walk
"The Forbidden City is a must to see. It covered a much bigger area than we thought so allow quite a few hours. There were crowds of people outside each building and we had to shuffle to see inside without too much to actually see in there. The buildings, statues and carvings are worth looking at though. They cut off the crowds at 80,000 people each day."
"This forbidden city is large as giant size. All buildings are stand for thousand years. Walking to this place is like you travel back in time and see what's going on in the place and how people in this palace live their life. Also king and queen life is different from ordinary people. Many more to find out the history and understand China.
Suggest to spend 1 day for this place. Passport is required to present your identity at the security gate. After pass the security gate you will be ableto walk to the entrance of palace and purchase the ticket. Suggest to come early, manh Chinese tourist come here every day."
"I was here in October with 2 friends, it was busy, so many tourists we nearly lost our guide a few times, its really nothing special."
"Going into the forbidden city gives you the feeling of how it was ago. How the emperors ruled this land and how they built this will amaze you! It has 9 huge gates before you can get closer to the emperor! The place is huge, they say it will take you 3 days to cover everything!"
"Like so many things in brochures they look really enticing. The forbidden city was unbelievable . The size , it w as enormous.The buildings were beautiful.It was verybeneficial to have a guide who loved her work. When you think of when it was built , even though many building were similar it wS a worthwhile experience Nexus holidays was great"
".... yes, great history. It is a huge complex that houses ancient palaces, garden etc. Depending on the seasons, there can be a huge crowd here. I was here last November during early winter, there were not so many people. I'd like to see more actually, like the palace artifacts, personal room of the emperors/concubines (saw 1 room but locked, only could see through windows), paintings etc not just collections of bronzewares and ceramics. Saw the throne from far as visitors couldn't go near it. May be I didn't explore a lot of places. Will definitely come here again to explore more if I were in Beijing again."
"Had to go back to hotel to get passport or no entry, thankfully hotel was near by and we didn't endure any major queues - but if it had been more crowded would have been a nightmare (but we should have double checked if we needed them, just don't want anyone to make same mistake!) otherwise well worth the visit! Most of the gates are similar but look fabulous against the blue skies and city back drop we were lucky to have that day!"
"Throughout our tour of Beijing the organisation by China Highlights' Marco was superb. His knowledge of the places we visited was good and he made it all very interesting. The Forbidden City was at the top of my list, having seen The Last Emperor, which was actually filmed in the real city. It is so impressive and the whole is maintained very very well. My only disappointment was the fact that the treasures are in Taiwan and not here."
The forbidden city is built on a massive scale and yet you can find it crowded (too many local tourists). It is very close to Tiananmen station.
"You read about the Forbidden City but until you see it in person, you can't grasp how big it is. You go through one gate and then another and then another and realize that you have only been in a small corner of the entire palace. Amazing and beautifful."
The forbidden city is one of the most important sightseeing in beijing. It is located in the city center . It is very close to tian an men subway station . You gonna spend 3 hours there. It is better if you have a tour guide .
"It is very nice, but it is all very similar so you go through a gatehouse building to another very similar gatehouse building, when in Beijing this is one of the main sites and does have to be done, but after a few days in Beijing you can get a bit temples out"
"The pictures that you see do not to the size of this place justice…I mean massive. It is about twice the size of Tiananmen Square, which happens to be the largest square in the world. The palaces are stunning and you feel like you are transported back to a different time in history."
This place is a feast for the eyes exhibiting the Chinese architecture which is very rarely seen now.
"Another must see place when in Beijing visit the biggest palace. The old buiding is made up of vast complex of buiding, various pavilions, bridges, and palaces. the man-made hills at the back of garden amazing!"
"Do not leave this site out! The cultural and historic importance of the Forbidden city will be explained and enhanced by seeing artifices and documents displayed here. The whole area is worthy of a complete day, but, as ever in China, it's much better with a proper guide. Everywhere gets very busy, with lots of tour groups, so get there early."
"Even though there are a lot of tourists, they have improved and refurbished much of the Forbidden City and is so worthwhile to visit."
"I vent on a weekday in November. Other people i have talked to, say that I was very lucky because on most other periods and in the weekends the crown is much bigger and the queues too. People are different, but for me, this is a two-three hour attraction. Don't take pictures of the uniformed men (didn't do it myself, but the guy next to me did, and they DID NOT like it)."
"A must-see on visit to Beijing this landmark requires time, patience and admiration. Everyone should explore this place at some point."
"We had gone in tour group and we had arrived Forbidden City in the morning around 10 am , we walked to the palace quite far and crowded, nearly all places had FORBIDDEN TO ENTER (it's really forbidden City) , and the toilet is very BAD too !"
It was a cool experience. Must do when in Beijing. There were not too many people during our November visit.
This is another cultural heritage of Beijing which has been preserved carefully and adequately. The place is clean and is always full of visitors from China and from all over the World. We can learn a lot of the cultural and historical China in here. All the palaces are magnificent and well-kept. It is a pleasure for visitors to walk around and learn about historical and cultural China.
"The forbidden city is a must see attraction in Beijing to see the east's best palace and its beauty. Any season would be fine, do carry your passport as they require them to pass the security check and also to get the ticket."
"Every time we thought we had reached the end, there was more. The architecture and detail is amazing. Be ready for huge crowds."
"A huge place to visit and monumental. All buildings, not many artefacts. Large crowd numbers. You need to line up early and get there early. Easy access through Tianamen Square or via the subway. The head phones weren't that good and I would not recommend these. Read on the history before you and you will enjoy better."
We didn't want a tour because we just wanted to wander and experience the atmosphere. We bought tickets on our own (but it was November) and avoided tour groups and crowds being on our own. There is a lot of history but sometimes tour guides just talk too much for my enjoyment.
The Forbidden City was one of the places I absolutely wanted to visit in China (of course!). And it didn't disappoint - the grandeur and splendour of the place was pretty much just as expected.
My husband and I visited Forbidden City as part of our Nexus Holiday tour. We visited with our tour guide who was able to provide us with lots of information about the history of the Forbidden City. We were amazed at the sheer size of the Forbidden City and spent over two hours exploring. Highly recommended if you are in Beijing! I would definitely recommend visiting with a guide and allowing at least two hours.
Very cool history and architecture. Busy with tourists as expected. But architecture and history lesson was amazing. A must see.
"Recommended to visit on weekday , requiring 3-4 hours to complete and better to visit in morning. You will find lots of visitors on weekends and may trouble you in visiting"
"Heard from one friend you could rush through this place in an hour - he couldn't have been more wrong

Would plan 3+ hours - so much to see and explore here. Tons of history and beautiful architecture - take your time and bring a camera!"
This location was one of the trips we made on our 15 day tour to China. Booked by Sinorama in advance so we did not have to wait in line for purchase of tickets etc. A lot of walking from the entrance to the exit.
"Went there in end of october, the good thing was there was no queue like in summer, so was able to see the place with no limitations by others. Plan around 3 hours to walk through (if you are fast walker) to see all the sites. But be prepared that there is not much options to grab a food so you might be hungry."
"The place is so grand and magnificent that it really is worth going inside despite the crowds. There are hordes of people, but you will push that aside of your mind once you go in and marvel at the beauty of the Forbidden City."
"Spent three hours in the Forbidden City...always something new to see. I've been two other times and learned more each time. It was a bit chilly, but a great visit."
"The best part of this tour where the guide talked about the various dynasty's, the emperors and their 3000 concubines. The various chines style architectures are worth seeing but each leads into a large vacant courtyard.

There is not a lot to see and one spends a lot of time on buses and waiting around."
Nice place and if you have tour don't miss this place. A lot of palace to see and wide. So many tourists came here
"It's big and there is a lot of security. There's security within security but it's worth it!
There are a lot of tourists but it's worth checking out. It's a little slice of history"
Of course we had to visit Forbidden City. Thank goodness our guide had booked our tickets online (we had given the tour compnany our passport information prior) so we literally just walked in. Having a guide is essential - she took us to unique places and we enjoyed walking on the exterior wall. The palace is huge and VERY CROWDED.
"We had a really bad experience at the Forbidden City. Due to the sheer volume of people around we could not figure out how to get into the palace. We got waylaid by a young lady trying to sell us her art, purchased the wrong tickets make sure you are buying for the palace museum!!

Despite all this once we were in the place is huge, the detail on the buildings is amazing.

I took my 6 year old son and would say this is not a place for children.

I would go back but without the kids.We also visited out of season and it was busy so wouldn't like to go during peak season."
"This place is amazing. It is huge. The history is fascinating and very interesting. It makes you want to watch The Last Emperor movie again now that you have insight to the palace. There is always crowds of people there especially on weekends. We had a lovely guide, Lilly, who was very knowledgable. I would recommend a private small tour as you will lose out on historical information given by the tour guides if in a large group as it can be noisy with the number of people around you."
"This has alot to see. Make sure that you spend time here. We were rushed through this site on our tour which was disappointing. We arrived late as it was closing, but I would have liked to spent more time."
Took some pictures but just looks a gigantic warehouse that held people. Could be better if they opened up all the rooms.
"I've been to the Forbidden City three times. To be honest, the first time was enough. Once you're in, there's really not much to see or do, you just keep walking through the same type of large concrete areas. If it's crowded, you can't really see inside the building at all. Additionally, you aren't aloud to go inside of them, so it seems a bit pointless. With that said, I think that because of its historical significance, you really must visit there if you're in Beijing.Go early enough to visit the gift shop."
This is the second time I have visited . Truly magnificent and so much to see and do . The craftsmanship and size are outstanding . A must do if in Beijing . Magnificent China .
"It is truly impressive walking through the gates and finally arriving at the square facing the Hall of Supreme Harmony. Gigantic the vastness of the whole Imperial Palace. You can spend hours there, even a whole day. There is just so much to see, do and observe. Yeah, and watching the hordes of tourists has a certain beauty as well, especially when you’re on your own and have a nice place to sit and sip your drink. Definitely a must see in Beijing."
"The Forbidden City is simply enormous. One can spend days exploring it. Buildings are mostly wooden so huge cauldron-like water containers (now empty) dot the courtyard perimeters for fire safety. Take a guide, stories are fascinating."
"The Forbidden City is a magnet for tourists including Chinese tourists who visit in large groups.

There's a 60CNY entrance fee. Half price if you're 60+ so take a passport to prove your age. The ticket office opens dead on time with a military precision. There are audio tours in English.

Entered through the Gate of Heavenly peace, citizens and tourists can now follow the route that only the Emperor was once allowed to use.

The site is on a huge scale and the buildings are impressive. Just walking through the space is a great experience.

On the negative side there's only limited interpretation and buildings are generally closed to visitors other than to allow them to peer through open doors. The story of daily life in the cloisters of the City as the told in any detail. There may, of course, be an issue of how much attention to pay to a discredited empire.

Be aware that visitors enter through Tiananmen under the fatherly gaze of Mao Zedong and walk in one direction for the length of the Forbidden City, exiting at the North wall and then having to all back to Tiananmen. It's a walk of several kilometres so be ready. Some enterprising cycle rickshaws are circling near the exit and will carry you back to your start point. The walk back is interesting though with a range of shops and places to get a drink etc.

This is a must-do for Beijing."
The Palace museum is must visit if you are travelling to Beijing. The museum complex is vast and flooded with tourists. Make sure you get the audio guides available at the entrance. Need 2/ 2.5 Hrs to go through the central section.
so much to see you don't know where to start once you are inside you just follow the crowd and go it is something one must see personally
"For sure it's a must see place while you are traveling to china.

It's always nice to be with someone while you are there but it's worth it to visit if you are alone.

A lot of history behind that place and it's something you must see for sure if you are around."
"To understand China even a little you have to dig into their history. The forbidden city is a must see place when you are interested in their culture. it is much bigger than I expected, just walking around there is a great feeling and an unforgettable experience. The place is probably always packed with tourists. I imagine that for a chinese citizen visiting Beijing for the first time it is mandatory to see the forbidden city and Tiananmen square. Almost like a muslim will travel to Mecca."
The forbidden city Is very immense and it requires half a day. The tickets are not expensive comparing to other places (in other cities). You need to bring food with you especially if you are travellers on budget.
"The emporers of yesterday year would have turned in their graves seeing how many normal people walked their palace! Be prepared to be overwhelmed with things to look at which proved the wealth of the ruler. Here are a few tips:
- During high/summer season, buy tickets online and pick them up at will call
- Enter the south gate and immediately take a left. Walk up the stairs on your left and you will be able to be where emporers stood to greet armies of the past.

A must see of Beijing!"
"I found this to be a really thrilling part of the trip - seeing the forbidden city was like a dream - I've read so much about this place, being there was very magical. It is large in scale and very impressive. The details are very intricate, and there is so much to see ... something like 9,999 rooms are supposed to make up this palace complex."
"Soooo many people there!!! it kind of kills the visit... basically just a series of big courtyards, not much is done to bring the buildings back to life...bit sad..."
"Recommendation: get a guide or audio-guide. I did not and i regret it, so for me it looked like a lot of very similars buildings. The city is huge, do not just walk straight forward, go to the sides also. Get a map if you can. Important remark: you need your passport to buy tickets."
Great to do if your near by lots to see but it isn't a full day I would say just an hour or so I spent here
"This is a must visit if you are in Beijing. You get a ticket to enter the palace museum, and there are separated meseum exhibiting some antique where separated tickets are required. We went for 鐘錶館 (clock museum) and it's worth it."
"Forbidden City is a world-famous viewpoint in Beijing. If you do not come to Forbidden City, you can not say that ""I was went to Beijing"". Forbidden City was the place where the emperor lived in the past, now open to visitors to watch. The weather is very cold in the day when I went to Forbidden City. We look at the national flag in Tiananmen Square before went to Forbidden City, and I was numb because I was too cold. But fortunately, when we came into Forbidden City, the sun is coming out. Forbidden City is very grand and full of old-fashioned atmosphere. It made us can not help but full of awe. Whenever here are full of tourists. Everyone was feeling the charm of the Forbidden City. We wandered in the Forbidden City for nearly three hours, we almost passed all the place which are allowed to view."
"The place where we go for graduation trip had been chosen by our classmate, basically, all of us chose to go Beijing.

Forbidden City, the palace of the Ming and Qing dynasties, it is the place I want to go for several years because I love Chinese history, I want to see the place the kings were living in. When we arrived there I felt so amazing, it is so huge and magnificent sight. I can't really remember the sight I saw that moment but I can still remember the feelings. But I think that I may not wanna to go there for the second time, there are too many people and they stand everywhere, I am short and I cannot see anything! It gave me a bad feeling, but if there are not many people I think I still wanna to go because I see nothing last time.

By the way, it still a good place to go."
"I really enjoyed this trip and was able to walk to this and other venues by walking from my hotel.
It also helped that my Chinese GF was with me who saved me from many scams while traveling around the aria."
"Spent a full day hiking through the forbidden city. Lots and lots of walking, great historical introduction. Highly recommend spending a day here. Amazing size."
"Forbidden city – The Palace Museum is also worth to visit it. This place can let us to know more histories about China. Forbidden city is so big. I think this place can walk a whole day. There have three route to provide the tourist which they want to walk. Although I was going to Beijing three time, I also do not walk around the Forbidden city. It is because this really so big. I really want to walk around the Forbidden city. I hope that have the opportunity to do that. Someone maybe think about that is so boring. But I can tell you that it is not boring, it also is the interesting place. There has some cosplay shop, you can borrow the clothes to take photo. It is so appropriate for children. They will think that so funny. And also is the nice memory with children and parents."
"huge place needs lot of walking, need a guide to know about the place. interseting place with open spaces.if it is crowded also enough place to move around"
"Even with the crowds, which were significant, the forbidden city is well worth the visit. The grounds are huge so there is lots of room for the throngs who visit. There is a lot of walking and very little protection from the sun, so bring water and be prepared for long waits to get into the attraction and to visit the pavillions on site. Also, do your research before you arrive as there are few explanatory signs. Once there it is easy to imagine what it was like in the past with the Emperor and his family roaming around the buildings. Perhaps most impressive are the gardens with impressive old Cypress trees, an incredible rockery and lovely pavillions."
"Beautiful place with alot of culture ... but also ALOT of tourists, so hard to get the pictures I wanted. Be sure to check schedules because it is closed at certain times. Lots of walking involved, but on a nice day it is a good treat and should be seen when in Beijing!"
"Go EARLY!
If you are not in the vicinity go there by subway to Tiananmen east. You will have to go through the security check and then walk ahead to the portrait of Mao. Go through the gate and pass 2 big squares. Then buy your ticket on the left (60/40 RMB depending on the season).
The main direction is going straight ahead, bur before coming to the end turn right or left and walk back. There are many alleys with interesting buildings on both side of the main direction. Cross the one of the main squares and take the other side back to the end (north).
When you are done had over across the street to the Jinshan park (2 RMB), where there is a hill overlooking the Forbidden City (and the skyline of Beijing)."
"Having a chance to stay over the weekend in Beijing, I had to choose on a destination from my hotel. I realized that if I had stayed close to downtown I would have been closer to the Forbidden City. However, I don't regret paying for the cab back and forth. Fortunately I took my comfortable shoes:it was a lot of walking. Not investigating before, I did not know the treat that I was just about to have. It is an enormous place with many things to see. Do not miss it if you come out to Beijing. Do plan for a cab afterwards. It can be pretty expensive if you get the local ines. They will try to double the fee, if not more."
The Forbidden City covers a huge area so you need to be prepared foot wise and carry water as well. It was quite a walk from our hotel to the City to start off so we were happy to have a break for a few minutes before entering the Forbidden City. Years and years of history combined with wonderfully carved buildings kept us spellbound for a number of hours. It is a revelation to see what lies behind the entrance to this amazing place. We were p[articularly amused by the flowery language used to title the various areas and buildings of the City. Not to be missed.
"The Forbidden City is awe-inspiring in terms of its heritage, beauty and scale - the palaces and temples just keep coming. Don't expect to ""do"" this attraction in half an hour - take at least a half day and be prepared for a good walk. It's also a good place to learn about Chinese culture, philosphies and religions during the dynasties that ruled until 1911. You can also take a visit to the Communist Party Tea House and be treated to a presentation on China tea and resist if you can the retail opportunites that follow. Talking of which, there is also an excellent shop/gallery where sits a well-know Chinese artist who paints with his hand and fingers. We were entranced by his work but couldn't find a piece of the right size. No problem - ""tell me what you want and I'll paint it and have it delivered to your hotel tomorrow "". This inexpensive piece of original Chinese art (plum blossom - a favourite theme) now has a prime site in our home."
I was overwhelmed by the massiveness and splendor of this place. Picked a cool autumn day with manageable crowds - it was magnificent. Be sure to allot for enough time and do stroll around some of the adjoining neighborhood shops.
"The Forbidden City is a huge tourist attraction in the heart of Beijing. It is crowded but orderly. There are many, many buildings but you cannot go into any of them. Across from Tian'Anmen Square and near a fun food/shopping street."
"This is a great place to go in the morning to relax or meditate, or bring a book in the afternoon. It can get busy, but there are plenty of places to hide away and just ""be"" with the gorgeous atmosphere."
"The sheer size and the number of all the buildings is beyond any expectations. Just beautiful artwork and paintings. We kept imagining that movie ""The Last Emperor"". One of those iconic places that does not disappoint. We were so happy to be there, and loved meeting all the Chinese tourists who were also overawed by the city. Don't miss it - soak up the atmosphere, be awed by the artistry and share smiles and selfies with the lovely Chinese visitors. Well worth the queues and the security checks. When you first go in the ticket office is for the gate tower. We skipped that, and the next lot of booking offices have a ticket for the whole Forbidden City. This is the one you must buy."
"Forbidden city is just like other ordinary palaces in japan and korea, perhaps the only difference is the size and historical significance in chinese history. The walk is tiring with so many people mostly chinese from the provinces. But of course you cannot say you've been to beijing without visiting this place."
"It's enormous and definitely a must visit when you're in Beijing. The crowd was huge even in low season, so you need to be careful with your belongings. Also, ignore the locals who might try to lure you into buying tea, painting, etc. That said, once isn't enough to visit the Forbidden City, we'll need to come back."
"what a wonderful day we had with Jack, guiding us thru the Forbidden city. Jack has wonderful knowledge and speaks good English. and is only to happy to answer your questions."
"The palace complex is very large. You will enjoy the home of the ancient Chinese Emperors. This palace is named Forbidden, becoz normal people and shoulders were foebidden in this emperor palace. This is a historic place."
"We saw 20% according to our Guide William. We were there for 1.5 hours, I learned so many facts and imagine 3,000 cocubines! How was it all build and so long ago, China is so facinating to me."
"In going here you will understand the incredible richness and isolation of the Chinese imperial dynasties. Huge courtyards, brilliant detail and massive luxury, locked away from the populace of the day. It is far too much to take in in a single day. You simply cannot miss seeing this if you have the opportunity."
"The ""Forbidden City"" is an one of the greatest place where we must see in Beijing. Forbidden city has great history. I have seen forbidden city and knew its history at the first time from movie named "" The last Emperor"" directed and written by Bernardo Bertolucci. I was so excited to see real forbidden city when i was going there. The main reason why i really wanted to see forbidden city was i liked the movie a lot. that movies is about life of Puyi who was the last emperor of China. Puyi's life was showed from his very young age to his imprisonment and political rehabilitation. There is one scene that last emperor tried to climb up the wall of the city to escape to his family, but it was not succeed. I wanted to see how forbidden city is isolated. In my opinion, my expectation and reality of forbidden city were quite similar, so i was delighted. One thing that made me bit disappointed was that we couldn't enter any of those house or rooms. We could only see through its windows or doors. However, i know that is kind of protection of those kind of heritage. If they allow all tourists to enter, we could damage. Therefore, we need to be respectful. If some one wants to see forbidden city, i strongly suggest you that watch the ""The Last Emperor"" movie before you go, It would be more delightful."
Impressive Structure. Fascinating history. Go with a guide who explains the internal features such as the paving stones go deep to protect from underground invasion and the confines of the Concubines. Beautiful private gardens. Take your Camera.
"One has to come and see for himself or herself the Forbidden City in Beijing in order to appreciate the absolute magnificence and historical importance of one of the foremost tourist and local people destination. The vastness of the whole Forbidden City is amazing and is truly incomparable. The efforts put in to maintain and restore the buildings, temples, halls, and pavilions are immense and is a tribute to the Chinese government. A lot of the halls and buildings look similar but each have historical importance and should be appreciated. When in Beijing, go and visit the Forbidden City. It is just next to the Tiananmen Square. Don't miss it!!!"
Had an excellent time here. Off peak but still heaps of ppl. Would had to see it during peak season. We didn't have to wait long for tickets or anything. The automatic guide with the headset was informative. We had a couple of issues with it working intermittently but would still recommend.
"It's hard to get over the sheer size of the forbidden palace, you could easily spend a full day here. It was great to see such an iconic part of China's history. I was really impressed by how well preserved some of artefacts and statues inside were. It does get very busy with tour groups so it's better to visit on a weekday or early morning."
"Of course it's the forbidden city. You must see it. But I was a bit disappointed once inside.
Plus I got ripped off by a man offering me a tea just before... Pay attention to the good Chinese English speakers... Do not accept their invitations, you always have to pay in the end otherwise you get in trouble... 380 RMB for 2 cups of tea remains expensive..."
truly an awesome experience.My wife and I did a Nexus tour the tour guides were well informed about the sites and history. the palace and square were uinbelieveable well worth the visit
"we had a fabulous view of the FC guided by Peter our guide, supplied by China Odyssey Tours. He was excellent and made sure we saw and understood the history of this amazing attraction. It was mega crowded but everyone was polite and accommodating, One visit is not enough."
"Another must see in the area. The history and grandur of the place was mind blowing. It is hard to imagine that this was built so long ago and is still here today. The history and artifacts are very interesting. You could spend hours wandering around this ""city""

BObK"
"If you only have time to see one of Beijing's main attractions then the Forbidden City (and Palace Museum) has to be it. Located immediately across the road from Tiananmen square so the two can be done together.

The Forbidden City was built in the early 15th century and is huge (approx. 180 acres I believe). You will need at least four to five hours to do the place properly, longer if possible. Personally we enjoyed the outsides of the too numerous to mention buildings (actually 980), the ornateness and beauty of the buildings, bridges, water features, gardens was absolutely stunning. Having said that the insides of many of the buildings were also stunningly decorated.

Given that this was the royal palace for the Chinese Emperors for over 500 years the amount history within these walls is truly mind blowing.

Note entrance fee for the Forbidden City is 40 yuan, it is closed on Mondays.

After exiting the Forbidden City you will find yourself opposite Jingshan Park (Hill) which is also worth a visit especially as you get a great view of the Forbidden City below.

Although obviously busy with both local and foreign tourists the place was definitely serene and even tranquil. An absolute must see............

Tip: although going with a guide is obviously good try an avoid a large group. We were part of a large group but peeled away as the progress was painfully slow and we wanted to see as much as possible in the four hours we had to explore."
"Another must see place in Beijing, this is where the emperors of Ming and Qing dynasty resides back in the days.

There are only 80k tickets sold for a day, during peak season, it gets sold out pretty fast (according to our AirBnB host). You can book your ticket one day earlier, same day tickets are not allowed though. It is also closed on Mondays, so plan your time properly on this.

Anyway, this is where the emperors, empresses, concubines, eunuchs and others stays during Ming & Qing Dynasties. Looking around, the building share the same characterization, with oriental shaped roof, and rectangular shaped halls and rooms. Each hall has its own function and the emperors and empress has their own preference where they wanted to stay. Tourist are not allowed to enter the hall, but if you liked it, you can try to squeeze yourself in to take a picture of each hall.

Do get an auto-guide to ease yourself from wandering and wondering what is all about Forbidden City. It definitely requires lots of walking as the place is freaking huge. They museum did put in many chairs to ease your tiring feet, but since it's autumn. I rather prefer to keep walking than having my feet cramp from the coldness. There are also lots of souvenirs shops in the palace, which sold from snacks like burgers and coke to palace themed souvenirs. Near the exit, there are more exclusive looking stores that sells expensive stuffs like silk and tea.

Some of the halls are still decorated by the things that the emperors or empress used in their lifetime. 980 buildings built in 14 years, the place is a must see if you like Chinese history. What amazed me is the architectural details and the long red walls that has been a symbol of the forbidden city. One can only imagine the life within these walls.

Easily access by subway lines, the crowds entering this place is pretty crazy. It was extremely hard to take a picture without humans in it. But in any way, it was well worth it."
"One cannot visit Beijing, China without seeing The Great Wall and the Forbidden City. Thousands of years of history and legends had enveloped this majestic place. The center of the universe as the emperors of China called the Forbidden City. This is a massive area to explore with mass of humanity that visits this place daily. It was easy to loose your tour group among the lines and waves of people trying to see the throne room and other specific areas of interest.

I have listed some survival tips:

1. Know your tour managers number- we lost our tour group in the Imperial Garden due to many waves of tour groups. One of our member got lost and had to find a taxi back to the hotel.

2. If you have kids- be aware and keep an eye on them at all times- If it's easy to loose an adult, it's much easier to loose small kids in the crowd.

3. Pushing, shoving, and cutting in line is normal. So, don't get personal- be patient and stand your ground.

4. If you required help - you can approach another tour manager from any tours in the area. They can call your tour manager for you. They are used to these kinds of scenarios.

5. Always pay attention to meeting places that your tour manager designated.

The museum shops are awesome for souvenirs and books. I recommend museum shops because they can take credit cards and are more secured in their transactions.

It may be smoggy in this area. It may be wise to bring a mask for pollution protection."
"Before entering Forbidden City, we should pass through Tiananmen Square. When boarding the Tiananmen Square tower, in front is a overlooking of Tiananmen Square. This angle is the Chairman Mao's speech at the Founding Ceremony. I stood there and felt the magnificent scene on purpose. We are fortunately to see the Emperor Xuantong and Queen Wan Rong's photo in their later years. To the late Qing Dynasty, the palace had been had a camera. The Emperor Xuantong is very black and thin. For the Queen, very beautiful, at the time can be said to be the most beautiful in the country. There are so many scenes inside the Forbidden City that we can not finish in one day. At 3 pm, we reluctantly left the Forbidden City, and I step back and look at the Forbidden City, take a look at this Chinese imperial palace where more than 20 emperors lived."
It took us about 2 hours to walk through the Forbidden Palace. We did not stop to look at any of the rooms that were available for veiwing due to the tour constaints. Would like to go back again on my own to see it again.
It doesn't need a review. It is so amazing. It was my second visit and I approached it by zigzagging my way from the entrance at the South Gate up to the North Gate taking in some beautiful exhibitions en route. I then returned up the central axis and exited by the east gate crossing the moat. (This makes it closer to the subway at Tiananmen East). Words seem inadequate to describe this incredible experience so just go and see it for yourself.
"You'll need to produce your passport before you can buy an entrance ticket, but once inside, the grandeur and scale of the site is amazing for such an old complex.

Palaces, gatehouses, statues, each with its own purpose , meaning and story but despite significant tourists visiting, the whole site maintains a certain serenity and calm.

On emerging at the far end, there are buses, and of course plenty of street traders and motorised rickshaws to transport you back to a location of your choice. It's a fair ( and very interesting ) walk to the nearest tube station.

Overall, another iconic site available with very little fuss and at very little cost."
"Lots of History and Learning of the Past Rulers of China. It has amazing Artwork in all the buildings, inside and outside. Look ant the fiqures on the roofs. It tell alot about what people stayed in each residence as it worked up to the Emporers Residents Home. Lots of walking and climbing so be prepared for a good days excersize. Enjoy yourselves, take a lot of pictures also.
Its good to rent the self tour guide to understand what is going on as you tour this very large area and building. { it will have different languages, so you can understand.} My wife is Chinese so she speaks affluent Mandarin and English Language. She is and always is the Best Tour Guide for me.
Enjoy this Custom and eat Good food here also."
"We were in awe of the place. Highly recommend but best avoid weekends. Having said that, we still went on a Sunday as the place is closed on Mondays. The only time when we felt like packed sardines was when we were queuing to clear the security. You can enter the gu gong only from the front - Meridian Gate (Wumen). Once you get into the forbidden city, the place is so vast that you never feel claustrophobic. They have very cool GPS audio guides that you can hire in the various language if you do not have your own guide. Another great thing is that there is actually free wifi in the Forbidden City. They have a few outlets selling food and drinks but think it is best if you bring your own."
"It truly is a city. The complex is MASSIVE. Get ready to spend more than half a day just wandering within the Forbidden City. Do pay for the audioguide, it really helps in explaining the massive palace to the visitor.

This is a MUST SEE!

Get off at Tiananmen East station and follow the signs to the security check. Get ready to experience some discomfort jostling with some mainland tourists who seem to be unacquainted with the concept of queuing in line. Stand firm and give no quarter to anyone who tries to cut the queue! You can clear security faster if you have no bags on you :)"
"What an amazing place. A wonderful way to spend a day. The history, I had such a sense of awe...you also have to see the clock exhibit. It costs a little more but is definitely worth it!"
"There is just so much to see here - palaces, museums, architecture, artefacts. One can spend as much time as one wishes to here - from a 40 mins quick tour to a full day detailed tour. Either way you get a fantastic insight into ancient china and is well worth the trip. Entrance is thrugh Tiananment square at the south end which is well connected by subway. Exit is through the north gate, where you are left to fend for yourselves with no subway or taxis and extortionist rickshaws and private cabs. You are forced to walk 1-2 kms to the east or west to find some taxis."
"This place is huge and absolutely beautiful! Must-see, bucket list place to visit. Unbelievable! Beyond words!"
"With 9,999 rooms and twice the size of the Vatican (and, 3 times the size of the Kremlin), this city is a sight to behold. Built between 1420 and 1912, the Imperial Palace was ruled by 14 emperors of the Ming and Qing dynasty, till the Republic ended the party!
Off limits to plebs like us for over 500 years (trespassing would've likely resulted in execution), one can gain access for a meagre 40-60 CNY today!
Suggest hiring a tour guide from a reputable company (we used Viator and it was money well spent)."
"We arrived before opening time and joined the already lengthening security queue. It moved rapidly and in no time we had passed through grand Tian’anmen and purchased our tickets. So began a marvellous tour.

In the vast outer courtyard the gorgeous decorative marble bridges over the Golden Water symbolise the five Confucian virtues. Strict protocols attended the use of the bridges. The Emperor only traversed the central one, family members used the adjacent two while courtiers and officials were confined to the outer ones.

The wonderful raised Gate of Supreme Harmony with ornate surrounds and ascending steps took us to the main part of the courtyard. Watched over by a couple of imposing bronze lions, one has his paw on a globe indicating world dominion while the lioness has hers on a little cub signifying successful Imperial succession.

Next we came to the splendid Hall of Supreme Harmony, the largest building in the city. It was also the one with the largest crowds pressing to get views and photos.

Sitting majestically on a grand marble terrace it was an awe inspiring sight. Ancient vessels known as dings adorn the stairways leading to it. It has a beautiful interior as befitting the many Imperial ceremonies that were performed here. Central is the grand throne with richly carved decorations.

It was fascinating to learn another aspect of Dynastic culture, no trees were allowed here so that nothing would overshadow the Hall.

We marvelled at the exquisite stone carvings containing dragon themes that decorate the ascents to the terraces. Given that a single vast stone was used for the largest one, which had to be transported to the city, the undertaking and craftwork is breathtaking.

Next we came to the Hall of Middle Harmony, one symbolism of which was to adopt a middle route in all matters, not veering to the extremes. Sedan chairs for ferrying the Emperor are to be seen flanking the throne.

After viewing the fine Hall of Preserving Harmony we moved into the large Inner Courtyard. Beautifully bedecked with flowers and a dramatic dragon with same, it is the inner Imperial sanctum. Numerous ornate vats with gilded handles attached to animal heads were an attraction for visitors to rub, the results of which were plain to see with the obvious lustre.

The three Palaces here are smaller versions of those in the previous courtyard, with the first we viewed being the fine Palace of Heavenly Purity. Originally it contained the Emperor’s living quarters. Inside it is impressively decorated.

The Imperial Gardens are wonderful, luxurious with trees and greenery, serene and tranquil. With many delightful constructs in differing styles it was the sole preserve of the Emperor and his family for meditating and relaxing.

We exited via the north gate and walked along by the vast protective moat, after what was a fabulous and memorable morning."
"Forbidden City (literally, ""The Forbidden City""), located in the center of Beijing, is the most extensive palace complex in the world. He stretched out on the 961 x 753 meters, 720 thousand. Sqm. In it is located, 980 buildings.
The main palace complex, served as the residence of the emperors and their families, as well as the ceremonial and political center of Chinese government, since the Ming Dynasty to the end of the Qing Dynasty, that is, from 1420 to 1912 years.
It was built in the period from 1406 on 1420 years, as the palace of Chinese emperors of the Ming. Since then, the palace complex has undergone many changes.
But, still amazes by its grandeur. And, still attracts all guests in Beijing. It is always crowded. It is best to take care of purchasing tickets in advance on the Internet. If you do not do this then come here, you cannot get inside. Since the number of visitors per day is limited."
"You can't not go to the forbidden palace. It truly is incredible. I could have gone twice if my feet weren't dead and I had more time.

Watch out for people outside trying to trick away by telling you the number of tickets for the day have been sold out and other scam artists. Don't forget to bring your passport with you so you can purchase a ticket. Watch out for the crowds."
We did this on a guided tour and it is beautiful. It wasn't too crowded and the walk was fairly easy.
We loved the forbidden city! You kept going through these gateways thinking you were finished but there was always more to see. You could spend the whole day if you looked at everything. A must see if you are in Beijing.
"The Forbidden City is a must-see in Beijing. We walked to the front entrance (the south gate) from our hotel and arrived at 9am on a Friday morning. Hardly any queues and manageable crowds. The complex is huge and gives you an insight into the lives of Chinese emperors. If you want to see everything, allocate 2 hours. Recommend going on a weekday, as we walked past on a weekend and it was packed!"
"The Forbidden City is the greatest attraction in all of China. When I entered the main courtyard, my breath was literally taken away. Nothing prepares you for the magnificent vista placed before you. The power of the Emperors of China makes a profound impression - as was the plan of the architect and designers of the Forbidden City. I could spend days wandering around the many sites within the walls of the city.
Be prepared for huge crowds of follow visitors. 80,000 people are allowed in per day."
"When they say, ""city,"" think big. I bet you will walk 4 miles, so be aware of that as you start out. Grab a wheel chair if you can't walk that far, and there are a lot of steps going from each part of the city...middle to main, etc."
"This is the largest palatial complex in the world, and is a must see attraction when visiting Beijing. It's near Tian'an men Square, and both attractions can be visited in the same day. I suggest visiting here as part of a tour, especially if you don't speak Chinese. Also, try to avoid visiting during one of China's national holidays, as it will be very crowded and you might not get in."
"The Forbidden CIty visit is an importand part of a visit to Beijing. Visitors only see the Forbidden City, but as part of the visit you will walk through Tiananmen Square, which may be the largest public square in the world. You will also walk in front of the Great Hll of the People - an iconic Chinese landmark. Be sure to bring your passport to buy tickets to the Forbidden City. The price is very reasonable. A tour will take several hours and be sure to pay extra to visit the clock museum. The water clock is fascinating!"
"My advise for this site, have comfortable shoes and have a Chinese guide otherwise one cannot have a full appreciation of what you are seeing, there is so much in the Forbidden City. Guides are not expensive so research one but if you must do it alone then get a good guide book. We had a guide and started a year out to read ""Eyewitness Travel, Beijing"". Avoided all lines by having a guide too!"
"I went to the Forbidden City (The Palace Museum) with my friend on a sunny day. The weather of few days before was haze, but that day was a good day for me to go to this stately palace. I got the information about the Forbidden City from my parents and the history textbooks before I went there. We saw many palaces and the rooms which the emperor and his concubines lived. There were also some areas that did not open to tourists.
I enjoyed the symmetrical buildings and its symmetrical blueprint because ancient Chinese architecture pursues symmetrical aesthetic feeling. The details of every building is delicate and skillful. The Skillful sculptures in every palace deeply attracts me.
Because the sunset time is different in different seasons, the closed time is different. Do not go to the Forbidden City on Monday, and remember to go through security before going inside. It is worth visiting this great buildings."
"Very big and impressive quiet space. You must hire the audio to really understand it, otherwise it is simply a lot of similar looking Chinese palaces. Gives you a 90 minute history lesson into 2000 years of Chinese culture."
"This was not quite what I had expected. As the histroy of this place was so recent, I thought thre would be more arefacts to see and have a greater understanding of what it had been like. Still a must see if in Bejing"
Amazing place. Would strongly recommend getting the gps headset that explains the different parts of the city as you walk through.
An amazing place! Not so expensive to enter and absolutely amazing history and feeling all around the place. Make sure you wear comfortable shoes and there is a lot of walking and take a good camera. You MUST visit if in Beijing!
It was a good idea to visit Beijing in early November. I was told there were much less tourists than in warmer months. Still the city was full of people but it wasn't an issue. My favorite part was the gardens. The old trees seem to have dragons wrapped around the trunks.
If you were a Chinese then you can appreciate it more. I paid 10rmb extra for the treasure gallery and felt it was worth it.
"lots to see here but many sections are closed to the public. Once again, with Beijing, and China in general, the massive amounts of pollution detracted from the experience."
"On first entering the gate, the crowd looks Man who dominated by Local Residents of china.
immediately treated to sights china soldiers were military exercises.
enter each gate look how beautiful palaces built since the former government
how sophisticated people who build the Forbidden Palace earlier before.
Each artifact still maintained its authenticity.
I will come back to this palace, although overcrowding of people coming but still looks fantastic."
Avoid going to this place on a sunday or any holiday . Its a huge place with lots of areas to visit and history to learn from. It takes minimum
This place reminds us about the awesome history and heritage that China possess. This is a must see and you will learn to appreciate Chinese culture
"I can't imagine going to Beijing and not seeing the Greta wall or the Forbidden City. There are crowds but it is worth it gives an insight to how the Emperors lived and ruled in China.

Is an awe inspiring series of buildings with a unique feel to it from imposing at the front ending in more relaxed in the living and study areas.

We worth the visit."
"Forbidden City is rectangular in shape, it is almost symmetrical and hierarchically arranged so that all the main buildings are set in a north - south. All buildings are done in the style of ancient Chinese architecture.The most interesting are certainly two buildings: one that was designed for women who lived in the Forbidden City, the empress and wife of the emperor's subjects. In this room has an inscription that says women should not interfere in the affairs of men, but to enjoy and produce handicrafts.The second building is dedicated to the emperor and his empress where they spent three days after the wedding, and then be separated and the rest of his life living in different buildings..In one word:amazing!!!...Wear comfortable shoes and bring a lot of money for tickets and go on a tour of history..."
"If you're in Beijing, you MUST, emphasize on the MUST, visit the Forbidden City, the Palace Museum. It is absolutely amazing, grand and beautiful. We were blown away by the hundred years of history and the beautiful architectures. Forbidden City is divided into the Inner Court and the Outer Court. The Inner Court was for routine government affairs, which consisted of the Palace of Heavenly Purity, the Palace of Earthly Tranquillity and many others. Whereas the Outer Court was for grand ceremonies, which consisted of three major halls; the Hall of Supreme Harmony, the Hall of Central Harmony and the Hall of Preserving Harmony and other halls. It take can up to four days to see the entire Palace Museum. If you're touring the place by yourself, you should get the automatic guide for 40rmb. There are no words that can describe this one of a kind experience. You MUST visit the place to see it and to soak it all in!"
"This is a must see!
Tickets are required as is a long security line to enter Tieneman Square and should be done together.
The palace was built 1400 years ago by 1million workers.
The detail is spectacular as is the space and thought put into the forbidden city."
"The Forbidden City is a UNESCO listed site. As with all important places in China it requires security check points prior to entry. Suggest a guided tour to explain the history as you walk through. Be prepared for lots of walking as the area is hugh. The tour consists mainly of the extrrnal aspect of the city buildings as there is little internal access except via window viewing. Some still have pieces of furniture, vases, bowls and decorative items from the era on show. Our tour guide walked and talked us through this richly beautiful yet hauntingly cruel city sharing a wealth of historical information. An insight into a whole different world contained behind high stone walls and protected by a mote."
"Be prepared to give this a lot of time if you want to do it justice. If you are interested in History and have read up on Chinese History before you come, a quick rush round will just leave you desperate to go back- not an easy thing to do!

I had organised a private tour before I left the UK. This meant I had a guide just for my husband and I. She was able to negotiate tickets and guided us around the site. I also had a guide book with a plan of the forbidden city, which we referred to in order to keep it clear whereabout in the palace we were. It is a big complex and needs a lot of walking. The obvious route is to walk from courtyard to courtyard down the middle. Yet there is still a lot to see after that. Down each side are rooms that were set aside for concubines and for the queen mother. This takes more time, but it is interesting to see the differences between the middle and the sides. All the way through, the architecture and the attention to detail makes it a fascinating visit;hinges with dragons; roofs with lions and dragons on the ends; ceramic tiles with flowers.When you finally make it into the garden art the back, there are the schoolrooms that the last emperor used as a boy. If you still have the energy, climb the hill with pagodas on it in the park directly behind the Forbidden City and see the whole city laid out before you. This is a fitting end to a wonderful visit. Allow all morning, about 3-4 hours.
The worst bit was trying to see the thrones in each hall. The guide told us to get our elbows out- and wow! we really needed them! No idea of queuing here!
This was a place I had dreamt of seeing for many years and it did not disappoint."
"The forbidden city was a must see while in this capital. If you want to have the peace of mind, please go there before the crowd comes"
"Visited in october 2016. Need to purchase tickets in advance, only 85.000 people allowed per day. Beautiful buildings, great history...just sooo many people. Make sure you avoid the masses by walking on left or right side of the main ""line""."
"This was our favourite tour, definitely worth having a guided tour as it is so large, very easy to get lost!! Magical place full of history & culture, lovely garden within. Beware a lot of walking and steps involved!
Must do"
Awesome place to be and wonder around to see how the lived many Years ago. 100% worth it :) go and enjoy.
"This is a place for Chinese tourist as well as foreign tourists. So it is crowded. There is so much to see, and very crowded. So be ready to be filled with a lots of information and surrounded by millions of people. Can be a little overwhelming."
Another must see in Beijing. Huge complex. Lots and lots of walking. Lots and lots of buildings to take photos of. A tour guide is a must. You truly need to hear the history behind the Forbidden City and the events that went place inside the gates You otherwise miss so much of what this city represents in Chinese history. Not handicap accessible. Allow a minimum of 4 hours. Gates close at 5p and they are very adamant about getting you out of the gates. Wonderful old Chinese buildings with carvings in jade and bronze. The stuff we all read about in Ancient history in school.
"Huge, worth the time & effort, a lot of walking. Can wander around at your own pace. Lots to see. Good to have a guide to explain some of the nuances, but not a necessity.
Can't really say you've been to China without a visit here."
"First time to China, wanted to say I've been to the Forbidden City. I was travelling solo that day. Went on a Tuesday and arrived at 10am and it was packed with people. 45 minutes in line to get a ticket and then another 10 or so for security. I opted to walk on the outside and there were some great views without having to pay! Paid 2rmb to walk through a park that let to Tian an men Square.
Make sure you have comfortable shoes.
If you look anything other than Chinese you will get asked to be taken on tours, choose wisely. Barter, don't accept the first offer of 200rbm!
It was alright to be able to say I was there but not worth going inside with the sea of people."
"Lucked out with clear blue skies. Walked through palace in a couple of hours. Really need a day!
Glimpse of past and also how important this is to China now.
This is a globally important site.
I'd in Beijing then you must go"
"Amazing place, paid to have recorded translation of history which was well worth including as it made the day more interesting"
"Recommend going with a professional guide, as some parts can be repetitive, and they take you through some unique spots you might miss whilst going alone. The forbidden city itself is astonishing. The buildings are beautiful, the history unique, and definitely a must see whilst in Beijing."
Was overwhelmed with the size of the Forbidden City. Outstanding architecture. Most of the antiquities are now on display in the museum across the street.
I visited this on a guided tour which I would recommend. The palace is absolutely massive. We where there a few hours and didn't even scratch the surface. Once you have been here all other sites like this seem to be insignificant.
"This is a ""must do"" historic attraction when visiting Beijing for the first time. The Forbidden City is a huge complex museum and make sure you give yourself at least 3 hours to properly visit. Licensed tour guides are available at a reasonable cost to learn even more about the history; audio guides in many many languages can also be rented.

It gets very busy - so plan to go first thing in the morning."
"The Forbidden City is on a vast scale. Be prepared to walk. We really benefitted from an informative guide who was able to describe so many things we would have glanced over. For example, the Emperor's fixation with the number 9. Everything is in groups of 9. Gets you looking and counting. In between Tiananmen Square and the Summer Place, the Forbidden City deserves at least 2 hours and, if like us you are doing all 3 in one day, make sure you are wearing your comfortable walking shoes. Be prepared for high security. Leave the Swiss army knife at home or you will lose it."
Really enjoyed walking through the palace and looking at all the ornate architecture and sculptures. For the most part it was not to crowded. For the cost of this attraction 60 cyn it is well worth it. It was a leisurely walk at your own pace. Places to stop and eat or get a drink and of course souvenir shops.
"A visit to Beijing (or China for that sake!) isn't complete without a visit to the Forbidden City. Ideally go with a (professional) guide since they take you through all the good parts and tell you all the background, but it's great without one too. Incredible architecture. It's huge, so spend a good few hours."
"We went a few years ago and had someone approach us to give us a tour for $30 US, which we did and it was great! This time the same thing happened but he (Jack) took us to the side museums and tried to convince us that was all the same and the forbidden city is so huge it would take days to see, which is not true! He wanted his money half way through the tour ( which we did not do) and I think he would have taken off if we did. After repeatedly asking to go to the main part we told him we would all go our own way without paying him. What bothers me is that if we didn't know what to expect already we would probably missed out on an amazing tour. So beware- and they now have tour guides available in the city run by the state, so that is probably a good way to go.
This tour could be as long or as short as you want. I would say at least a half day. It all depends on how much you want to walk, its beautiful and has alot of history and culture."
"We were able to walk from our hotel, lovely bright blue sky morning. Suddenly found ourselves in a huge queue which transited to be the queue to security check for the Imperial Palace, no signs, no nothing!! Queued for 45 minutes to be searched and have our bags scanned before entering the confines of the Forbidden City. Once in, the crowds are overwhelming, but it somehow doesn't matter as one is taken over by the whole experience of being there. However, you must remember to take your passport in order to purchase a ticket to allow you to progress beyond the initial courtyard - bit like in the old days!!! It is a must see for anyone visiting Beijing but be aware, security is predominant and also crime is prevelant."
Make sure you take the not so crowded side entrances and rooms to make the experience really magical....
"It is a little long winded to get into the place because of the security but the temples and buildings are really quite impressive. We bought the museum ticket, which isn't really like a museum but a ticket into the main section of all the temples and gardens. Worth the price for sure. There is also a lot to see for free but paying for that is a must. Real Chinese history."
"The history here is amazing and the sights are great, but be ready to push your way through past the elderly and children and the rest of the world if you actually want to see anything. We got really fed up with Chinese tourists very rudely taking pictures of us and one my friends was touched inappropriately in a crowd.
If you have mobility difficulties or are very sensitive to being in crowds then I'd skip it.
It takes 3-4 hours to see everything but you might have had enough by 90 minutes!
The summer palace was much much better! Fewer people, more space and better audio guide."
"Optimize your stay in Bejing due to the incredibly bad air, but this is of course a must see. Amazing historical site, feel the history, take nice photos to bring home... Prepare for a lot of people, and don't forget your passport (we did...)."
"1. Don't forget to carry your passport.
2. Super long queues so reach on time. Full day if you plan to cover entire area else 2- hours are enough to cover key areas.
3. Check weather beforehand as you have to walk a lot in open areas.
4. Audio guides are must..else everything will look similar and you won't be able to appreciate the place.

Now coming to the point....Forbidden City . It is Massive, laden with history and beautiful. A must-visit if you are in Beijing."
"This is the must see spot in Beijing. The palace is well maintained and in spite of the crowds, you get around and can see everything well. I would advise taking the audio guide for an additional 40Y. It makes meaning out of the buildings, statues and staircases. The scale of the complex is amazing, you find yourself thinking of the movie 'The Last Emperor ' in order to imagine life behind the walls. A walk around the walls alongside the canal,is also worth doing."
This is a must-see attraction in Beijing. But quite sad to see that many white parts have turned yellow probably due pollution. Need at least two days to see all.
"Of course you are going to visit here if you come to Beijing and you certainly must so I will just give some tips. It can take a good few hours so bring lunch to eat in the gardens (they are beautiful), don't accept offers of tours except from the official stalls and be patient with the crowds. You eventually do get to see everything despite the crowds and reading the signs is a great way of knowing where you are and imagining what it was like. Quite cheap too. Only undergraduates get a student discount though...sigh!"
"Planning our days we had no idea how much time you really need for this place, it really is a city when you see it, if you want a quick look and want to see everything you could do it in 3 hours, we walked around slowly had a look at everything and all up it took us about 6 hours! Such a beautiful place and so many different museums inside, interesting learning about Beijing's history !"
My wife and I visited the Forbidden City on a weekend in July - it was extremely hot and crowded with local and foreign tourists. But this did not detract from the historical significance of what was built here and the stateliness of the palace and grounds. Plan your trip in a less peak season to make it even more enjoyable.
"This was my second visit to this sight. Unlike the first visit, this time I had an English audio guide. This guide featured an electronic map and the audio automatically started speaking whenever I came into range of a specific sight. This made a big difference to my appreciation and understanding of the buildings. I spent about 3 hours here but could easily have spent 1-2 hours more. It was fascinating seeing the English and Chinese clocks, many enormous!"
Nice temple and ancient work of architecture. Bring umbrella for a sunny day. I appreciate the beauty of their art work. It's shows a deep Chinese culture in the different dynasty.
Very impressive. Cannot believe common people were not allowed when emperor was there. Wood construction so many fires throughout the years occurred
"My friend told me that there was a Forbidden City of sorts pretty much in every Chinese town. She also said that if you saw one, you saw them all. And if it is true at least to some extent, i think that you should go to see this one. Warning: as any other place in China, it gets PACKED (no, it does not matter what day of the week or time of the day it is, there will be a crowd) - but it is something you sort of get used to as you travel in China.
The place is beautiful! And i think if your goal is to check out every corner , it will take you at least a whole day because it is HUGE. We walked through all the central section from one end to the other, it was hot and humid, but it totally worthed it! But make sure you get an audio guide (although the info provided does seem to vary across languages which is weird) - this place has such an amazing history!"
"Must see touristic objective in the middle of town, where old meets modern, a long, long history of China dynasties."
"Talk about being HUGE! This is one large complex and a little overwhelming for the visitor so don't try and see it all. My tip, hire an audio guide at the entrance and see it yourself at your own pace. It's actually just empty buildings so it's really only what you see from the outside except for a few which have displays. Get there just on 8:30am to beat the thousands of domestic Chinese tourist bus loads."
The city is big and will take you 1-2hr to walk through it. Start your walk early or afterlunch there are no resto inside.
"The palace museum is huge, being the world's largest palace complex. As one of the top attractions in Beijing, expect huge crowd daily. Since 2 July 2011, the Palace Museum implemented a one-way tour route from south to north for all visitors in order to streamline human traffic flow.

There are many buildings inside this huge complex – gates, temples, halls, chamber rooms, pavilions, courtyards etc. The buildings architecture are amazing, though the design are similar with familiar Chinese colours - red and green. It is divided into two parts. The southern section, or the Outer Court was where the emperor exercised his supreme power over the nation. The northern section, or the Inner Court was where he lived with his royal family.

Get a tour guide to explain the history and complex details. Else one can wander around the complex and read the brief explanation of the signage. Need to spend a couple of hours here. Worthwhile to visit despite the crowd."
"It rained most of the time we were there but it did not make it any less enjoyable. This place is massive. We went end of October on a Friday around 10am. There were large crowds but the lines for tickets were very short. Don’t forget to bring your passport when purchasing tickets. I would recommend exploring the Hall of Literary Brilliance on the east and the Hall of Martial Valor on the west. They had great works of art on display and it was free to enter. Most visitors/tour groups tend to just walk through the center to the Hall of Supreme Harmony onto the Imperial Garden, then exit. So if you want to avoid some of the crowds, explore the sides."
I would recommend getting a through ticket to avoid having to stand in multiple lines. The treasury section is worth a visit. It is an extremely popular attraction and it was very crowded.
This is not a huge site and easily accessed by car and bus. It captures some of the very important history of the Forbidden City
"The forbidden city was pretty beautiful to watch and walk through. You can do it in combinatio with the tianenmen square.

The only two problems i had were:
1. To crowded, you can barely walk so many people.
2. For some parts you need to pay extra and other parts where closed.."
It was an amazing Landmark and a must see if your in Beijing... So big and just an awesome atnosphere👌
This site is very large and divided into several distinct areas. A nice walk through the area but fighting the crowd to get a peak through the windows at an old piece of royal furniture was really not worth the effort!
"We enjoyed this but it is so large and after a while, the buildings started looking alike. We spent about three hours here. We paid 40RMB for the audio translators."
"Very nice and colorful, there are accesses for strollers or people with limited mobility. Garden was absolutely amazing"
"Before visiting I was completely unaware of the size of the Forbidden City. I knew the exterior but upon entry I was amazed at the depth of the facility. Walk through one gate and courtyard and you find another gate opening up to another equally impressive courtyard. The architecture is superb and I recall thinking ""Does it never end?"""
"This highly historically significant series of buildings seems to go on forever from one courtyard to the next.
It is so massive, it is hard to photograph. Panorama photography is ideal here.
Mobility challenged persons would have a tough time over the long distance and out of the way ramps. I am not even sure there are wheelchair ramps everywhere.
Once thing is for sure, the crowds are huge and getting a picture of the throne in everyone of the six main pavilions would challenge s rugby player because of the scrum in front of every one of them. Be prepared to be elbowed and edged sideways for every shot. Sometimes it feels as if you are being carried by a wave trying to get closer.
I would definitely avoid the Palace during Chinese holidays where crowds and crowd behaviour get out of hand.
Bottom line, this is an impressive complex which needs to be seen under the right circumstances."
"Very interesting ! A guide is a must for this visit however.
Count 2/3 hours minimum & go through the Cixi area."
"My family arranged a 3 day tour of Beijing with China Highlights. We were based in the Novotel Peace, which was a good central location.
Our guides Chinese name translated as Smile. We had a small private 3 day tour which was excellent. Smiles English IS EXCELLENT. She is an excellent guide and we could not have imagined anyone better.
We were picked up every morning at 08.30 and our tour began. The 3 day tour costs US 289 US DOLLARS.The highlights are listed on the CHINA HIGHLIGHTS WEBSITE. My favorite was the GREAT WALL AT MUTIANYU. I would also recommend after hiking the wall U SLIDE DOWN THE GREAT WALL on toboggan run .
I would also recommend the Kung Fu Show at the RED THEATER, the energy is amazing.
Be prepared for large crowds at most of the attractions. The Wall at MUTIANYU takes about 1hr 20 mins to get to, but is not as busy as the city section and is well worth the effort.
Smile is an excellent guide and her easy going manner and knowledge and insights into life in China help to enhance the enjoyment of this tour.

TIP- if u are touring Dont pre-book your transfers. local taxis are much cheaper and just as efficient as private transfers, however u will sometimes have to que 5-10 mins to get one.
China highlights, may not be cheapest, but our guide and drivers were excellent. This is one of those cases that u get what u pay for.
I think all the guides would no doubt be good, However if available i would Request Smile for your tour."
"it is indeed the most visited palace in the world. it is huge and takes a few hours even if you run. the palaces are empty, all the furniture is in Taipei. the architecture is beautiful but uniform, all the houses are constructed exactly the same way. Still a must."
"We arrived by 7.30am and there were people everywhere. The city is absolutely amazing, I couldn't believe how big an area it covered. Fantastic."
"amazing collection of artifacts, bringing alive the mystery of the dynasties that ruled from this palace."
"This place is Huge, from entering on the front at tiananmen square all the way to the back it's all several football fields long. Make sure you when you visit the Forbidden City you wear some very comfortable shoes :-)"
"It forms a must see on the itinerary, steep in culture, visited with a very informative tour guide.
October was quite busy"
"Having visited the Palace for the 4th time already, I still enjoyed going there to appreciate the exterior building. There are not much to see about the interior set-up or any state level treasures (you need to go to Taiwan for that ); but the scale, the structure and the layout of the palace is something no where can replicate."
"It is murch larger than I thought and there are many people - try not to go on a Saturday, if possible. Take your time walking around, it is hard to imagine what it was like in imperial times. A lot of it is outdoor square/plazas so sun hat/sun block (summer) or warm clothes in winter is essential. In one of the gates on the left-hand side there are photographers that give you the opportunity to dress like an emporor and have your picture taken - interesting memory to take home."
"Architecture, Gardens and Bronze Sculptures, the best of forbiden city for me, we get there walking, but be sure that enter by Tian Men Square, also can get by subway."
"The place is walking distance from Tiananmen Square, lots of people visit but the queue was fine. Huge palace of China dynasty. the palace was quite old and we could not enter the rooms hence could only see that from outside."
"Before my trip to Beijing, I did some research on all the things I wanted to visit with the Forbidden City being one of them. Everywhere I read, people said you needed half a day to a full day to explore the site. This really is not the case. We did the whole thing in about two hours.

Sure, we were trying to avoid all the tour groups (as there were A LOT) but you really don't need that much time. If you are going into every single room and inspecting everything carefully, then yes, I'd say you need more time than the two hours we did it in.

It's a beautiful place but the experience gets spoiled by all the tour groups pushing and shoving to get a photo."
"I suggest to spend half an hour reading about the forbidden city, before seeing it.
This is a whole day event, bring some water with you."
"I did not know that the Forbidden City covered so much ground. It is over 130 acres, and it takes a while to cover it door to door.

That said, there is lots to see. The Emperor's throne and other artifacts were intriguing.

There were lots of people there the day that I visited. Wear comfortable shoes, and be sure to take along patients as people push and shove to get to the window where the Emperor's throne and Wedding night rooms are on display."
"The Forbidden City was the residence of the last imperial dynasties of China. No one was permitted to enter the City unless they are part of the family, a guest, or the served them. There was upwards of 3000 concubines who lived there as well, and none of them are permitted to leave once they entered. The term city is an apt description, it is just that big. There are many souvenir stores as you amble along and parts of the city are still being restored."
A lot of the same. Didn't find there was a whole lot to see here. The garden at the end was the best bit. I wouldn't recommend spending too much of your trip here. I think there are better sights to see.
This one is again really grand. Lot of walking to be done. Better to have a guide with you. But a place one must see.
"The day we visited here was the one day it rained heavily, which really altered my opinion. It was undeniably beautiful but very little shelters and a lot of walking was not ideal. I would recommend doing this on a dry day."
"First tip - it will always be crowded (from sharing of friends) so bite the bullet and go.
Second tip - there will be ""tour guides"" who approach you while you are queuing for tickets telling you they can help you cut the queue and give you a personalised tour. Take it, if you feel comfortable with the guide. This will help you tremendously.

I went with 2 other friends in March 2013 and while queuing for entrance, 1 guy approached us. We rejected him and shortly after, a lady came up and offer the same services (expedited entrance + tour). Our instincts were confirmed when she offered to purchased the tickets for us using her own money and we pay her when she comes back with them. Which she did. She went on to expedite the entry (cutting hundreds of people in the queue) and gave us a truly insightful tour of the entire palace in Mandarin. She was that detailed and good that other visitors actually tried to leech onto our group. Unfortunately, I cannot recall how much we paid her but we definitely gave her a tip at the end of the tour.

The palace is majestic (no puns intended) in scale and details with various halls / temples making up the entire compound. Each building has its purpose and without someone explaining to you what was the purpose and the history of the building, you are relegated to just walking among some beautiful buildings. Nevertheless, it is still worth your time if you are in Beijing.

I would say this attraction and the Great Wall are the 2 essential stops for any first timer to Beijing - if you have no time for any other stops."
Must see spot if you are visiting Beijing. It's always crowded there. We showed up around noon and got in quickly. I strongly recommend to hike up at the temple across the street at the exit. The ticket is only 2 yuan. It will give you a view of the entire forbidden city. It's worth it.
The Forbidden City brought back memories of seeing the movie The Last Emporer. The area is huge and there is a lot to explore. It is vast and time needs to be taken to get the best of this fabulous experience. It is a great place to let your imagination run wild about life behind these wall so many years ago. I suggest before going do a little research on what you are about to see as it is a fascinating place.
"We visited here on a glorious Sunday morning, the buildings and artwork are magical a definite 'must see' if you are in Beijing, it's a vast area and there is a lot of walking to be done and lots of steps too but it's well worth the visit."
Easy walking at the forbidden city. Enjoyed the dowager's courtyard. Lots of history. This is a must see historical sight
Great history. The garden was a sight to see something out of a book. There was a lot of people there when I visited yet the place was clean and well maintained
Expect crowds during the weekend and a struggle to see inside the different buildings. Also it's abit of a trek from the entrance to the exit gates.
Obviously The Forbidden City is one of the must sees in Beijing. The area is enormous and you actually have to do the Jingshuan park and get to the top to really understand how vast the area is. The main issue is that the local tourists are crazy about seeing the inside of every single hall so there's a lot of pushing and shoving once you get to the closed of entrance at each hall. We bought an audio tour in our local language (Swedish) and believe you don't need a paid guide to see this. The audio guides are great as they detect where you are and start talking about that specific attraction at the right time.
"The scale of the site and the buildings gives you a good sense of the world of the empowers and how they lived.
There are just hundreds of tourists here (we heard 100,000 a day) but because it covers a large area this wasn't an issue or as bad as it sounds.
Even if you are not that interested in architecture or the magnificent artworks it is worth a visit to see the beautiful garden at the north of the site and the area where the Empress and concubines lived.
We had lunch in the restaurant by the south entrance gate and had a very good set meal (great veg). Not sure if there were any western food options but when in China it seems only right to sample their way of doing things (note: loos a bit dire though but that seems to be a general observation of the country in our experience).
We spent the whole afternoon taking it all in and could have spent longer."
"I visited this on 10/29/16 and I went solo (no guide). I did not realize you have to bring your passport to get in, so my first visit I was ""forbidden"" from going in. Keep in mind the north gate there is a long security line to get through just to get inside before you even buy your ticket, so I was quite disappointed. BUT, returning the second day I entered through the east gate and my wait was perhaps 5 minutes- definitely the way to go if you're going solo or private guide.

That being said, I spent 3 hours there and bought additional tickets for other exhibits not open with standard pass. I think most tour groups go through the basic areas, so it's worthwhile exploring off to the sides and seeing additional exhibits. Not so crowded and it allowed me time to really read, study, and not feel rushed. The grounds also have seating areas for people who want to eat a snack or lunch, so it's fine to bring in food and/or drink and take a break. The history is amazing and a definite must see while in Beijing! Bring comfortable clothes, your passport, and keep in mind that it's a one way traffic going through. You cannot return out the front gates. Oh-and once you're out the back gates should you want to take a rickshaw ride, the guys there charge an incredibly high $ amount but will easily barter to half or so of the rate depending on where you want to go.

Across the street and up a bit is another park that is only 2 RMB and worth visiting as well if you still have the energy."
"One of the most amazing places you will ever see. Yes, its crowded, but so is everywhere in China. Lots of walking, lots of pushy tourists but have some patience and enjoy."
"For history buffs, well worth the visit. For sightseers, tourists and world travellers, a peek into the glorious past of this great nation, as this imperial palace was home as well as the seat of governance of emperors from early 15th century to early 20th century. Smack in the centre of Beijing, it also houses the Palace Museum. Declared a World Heritage site, it is distinctly Chinese architecture using mainly wood to construct the palaces. Do take your time and soak the epitome of Chinese ancient culture. It is forbidden to miss this venue!"
Given its location you may well find your hotel room provides you with a view over the Forbidden City - and you will be able to see Jing Shan Park to the north of the Gate of Divine Prowess which also forms part of the old city wall. Access is only south to the north. Climbing up the hill of the park hebind afte your visit is well worthwhile - the hill is acutlly made from the excavated earth from the moat which is still extant along the norther face. It is worth engaging a guide - e.g. China highlights to assist you in getting through this and other sites in Beijing esp. with a driver as this save considerable time.
"It is hard to visit without a guide because there is a lot of ground to cover. However, if you go with a group, you may be too rushed to enjoy it all. This was our second visit and it was better with a private guide. Your hotel can help with such. It is much better to pace yourself in a private tour."
"To be totally honest, the forbidden city is a bit over rated. Yes its a must see attraction but afterwards you may think was it worth it. However as I said its a must see, but its a lot of visitors and a fairly long walk thru the complex. Some parts of it, specially the statues and some other things is very spectacular, but I think you will need a guide that can explain all the features."
"I visited during my trip to Beijing last month. Its a must see for any visitot, great insight into the workings of the palace!"
"This palace is called the Forbidden city because earlier commoners were not allowed here.Protected by 10m high walls,watch towers,and moats ,it has around 9999 rooms ,and some 94 emperors lived here from the Ming to the Qing dynasty ,1406 to 1912 .
It is a world heritage site ,as per UNESCO .
Entry is through the Tiannemen square ,the Meridien gate ,and we found the police very helpful for directions.
however this is a tough place to visit esp during the holidays ,it is very crowded.
but dont miss it."
Good place to go with a guide as I took jack tour with a guide ...excellent service.also they have auto electronic tour guide .I went on Saturday it was crowded and it was a round trip to tianamen square which is just opposite ......
"After you finish at Tiananmen Square, you can go down into the underpass & go to the Forbidden City. You will have to pay to enter but that was part of our tour costs. My wife & I were here in 2008 & i can say they have made the venue more disabled friendly. From the front to the rear you can negotiate a wheelchair. there is alot to see & take in so allow yourself 2-3hrs if possible. We were there 2hrs & probably missed out on a few places. It is a massive area. Quite great to see though. Plenty of opertunities for great photos."
"This place is huge! Either you get a guide and spend the whole day here or you just walk through it and focus on a few things.
But you will get so much more out of the place if you try to understand what the different building were for.
There is also a little kiosk to buy water and snacks."
An amazing place to visit and a lot bigger than you think! Real interesting site steeped with history and you get a sense of how revered the Emperors were and how many times the dynasties changed. Loved the architecture and really got a sense of how the elite lived. Well worth a visit and a stones throw from Tiannemen Square so can quite easily visit both in one day.
"This is a lovely place but if you aren't Chinese, a lot of the significance is lost on you. Would be great to experience more sections with recreated furnishings to help your imagination."
"As you enter, you will marvel at how awesome this place is and attempt to imagine what it must have been to be the Emperor!!!! Building after building, room after room (9000 +), palaces, homes, gardens and unending beauty. You need several hours to explore and enjoy. It is a relatively easy walk with some stairs but mostly flat and you go at your own pace."
"Must see place in Beijing. Dont expect Europian architecture and luxury - it is purely asian, chinese, very beautiful, authentic, with touch of history and emperors' legends and some mystic in each and every corner. You will feel as if you are on the top of the mountain in some palace - eventhough you are simply in the center of Beijing. The planning gives the feeeling of space, wind, height. Definitely visit it and dont be afraid of the queue at the entrance - yes China has big population but security and ticket office is working very fast, dont be upset and tolerate it as it is worth seeing."
"A great place to visit to get a glimpse of the history in Chinese Palace.

I can still remember the stories our guides told us about the Forbidden City. Scandals between palace workers and the horrifying stories in the chamber of tortures."
"Saying that this place is massive would be a lie... it's beyond that. My partner and I spent a lot of time here and we didn't even manage to see it all. Yes it is impressive and well worth a visit, however it can at times also be crowded. We managed to be able to walk around towards the end of the day when most of the people had left. It can be confusing when trying to leave, as we thought we went the right way and ended up having to walk around the place twice before we found a way out. A great place to visit!"
"The tour of the Forbidden City is a very long, one-way tour, so once you are in, you have to keep going. After several hours, it really gets pretty boring and repetitive. The scale of palaces that the Emperor enjoyed were just amazing."
"This to me was the real China, the inside of the buildings the gardens and the whole history of the place. We had an amazing guide this is essential. but an absolute must."
"Its great to be here and see the a great China history . Architectural design is amazing , great crafstmanship on the temple. Unbelievably real."
"One of the must see's on any trip to Beijing. Special for many reasons - one of which being that until recently, the Forbidden Temples was unseen by the outside world for over 500 years. Exclusive to Emperors and their inner circle. A place of ceremony and mystery.

It has an air about it that has to be experienced to be understood.

Only downside to the experience was how busy it was. Very crowded (in fitting with the rest of the city). Impossible to get a photo of the main historical sights without fighting your way to the front of a crowd.

Still worth the trip though. Many times over.

I created a video diary of our time at the Forbidden City. I'm not permitted to post it here but if you're interested in seeing more - search David J Greenwood China on YouTube and you'll find it."
Great place to walk though this place once - imagining how those emperors spent their lives in such an isolated place. Not sure if that's a luck or not....
"I visited the Forbidden City mid week. There were large crowds but it was manageable.
I was there solo but came early (at the 8.30am opening time) and kept to the right side of the complex and was able to avoid the crowds.
The complex is spectacular for its sheer size and scale. Unlike other palaces I have seen elsewhere in the world.
Definitely a must see in Beijing."
"Wow, this place is pretty incredible. It is huge, yet still manages to be full of tons of tourists! After awhile it becomes a bit same-old, same-old, but by that time you have reached the museums, of which there are several on-site. Even though it is a tourist site, Westerners were still in the minority so it was a good time to study the culture differences too."
"The forbidden city is filled with history and culture. Another must see place when you visit Beijing. Get a good guide so that the stories of ancient Kings and queens, love, romance, and intrigue, come alive for you. But be prepared to walk and spend an entire day here. You will not regret it."
"The Forbidden City is a must visit when in Beijing. I was there on a Tuesday and early in the morning. I took a direct bus from where I stayed till TianAnMen East station. I got shocked when I came down from the bus because there was a very long queue (few kilometers) all the way till the security check before entering the main entrance of Tian An Men. After more than half an hour of queuing finally I got to enter the Tian An Men area. Since it was so crowded, the whole time I had to walk behind tour groups or maneuver myself around the crowd. Every corner of the palace is full of people. There was no chance that I could go near the exhibition halls to see the artifacts inside because of the crowds. Basically my whole visit there was just direct in and direct out. I guess everyday is this crowded there, doesn't matter whether it's a weekday or not. I am quite disappointed because I didn't manage to see much there."
"For starters, this place has over 9000 rooms and covers a lot of acreage. I had anticipated a singe very large palace but in reality it is a bunch of smaller separate buildings for accommodations and meetings. Our guide explained the significance of the number of roofs of the buildings and the number of animals on the peaks as reflecting the importance of each structure. Be prepared to see a ton of people irrespective of time of year as there are a tremendous number of domestic tourists that visit, complete with many large tourist groups chasing after their guides. Also be prepared to receive multiple requests for photos if you are of lighter skin. For many domestic tourists, they are accustomed to seeing folks that looks like them so you are somewhat of an oddity. Be pleasant and enjoy the experience and their excitement and all will be good."
"Toured The Forbidden City last week with a friend and our guide. I wouldn't miss this place and am so glad I had a chance to see it. Beautiful and astounding in scale. I am glad I was with our guide because there is so much to see and learn it would be overwhelming otherwise. There are electronic guides that you can rent, but our guy made it interesting. This place is enormous, so wear good shoes."
"The thing I most remember is the photo of the telephone exchange, don't know why but it has just stuck in my mind.
Overall I thought the museum had just scratched the surface of life in the palace, but that is just my opinion."
"Really grand palace. More than what we usually see in the movie. Place is really crowded with all kinds of tourists. When we lined up to buy tickets at the entrance, there were locals selling ""maps"" which highlight the details of attractions inside the Forbidden city. There's no map provided when purchased tickets. It's worth buying the maps as they are cheap. We got lost inside trying to look for different chambers. Some were closed for maintenance which was a disappointment. Only the outside are displayed for tourists. All inside are closed. To view the inside & find out what's it like, you can view them in the books from bookstore. Nevertheless this place is still a must to visit. It's a one way entrance & exit. When exit , if you have time & energy, should go to the nearby Jingshan Park. On top of this park you can view the Forbidden City in a ""overview""."
"A must visit when in Beijing, the Forbidden City is also a fixed point of any Chinese tourists.
The sheer size of the Forbidden City is impressive. Don't expect many antiques, as most have been taken to Taiwan before the communist party came to power in China, but there is also no need for them. The Forbidden City is impressive enough on its own.

When there make sure to also visit the adjacent Coal Mountain, which offers great views of Beijing and the Forbidden City."
"It wasnt public holidays, no weekend , no bank holidays and we were quite early in the morning... but my god! I ve never ever visited a place so full of people.
I know for Europeans the chinese culture can seem rather rude but how often my friend and me got pushed and pulled, how people just queue jumped, and shouted to make you move ... is unexplainable with culture or habbits. There were just too many people and everyone wanted to look at the sights.

It is a great set of architecture and they've done a great job in preserving it for the future generations.
But if i had to choose again, i'd rather watch a documentary about it."
"All of us, we had a great time with Tony and driver on this Sunday Touring.

Appreciated to Tony’s good English-guide in Forbidden city and the background of “Great Wall”.
Also especially, we had good time to enjoy the Chinese Tea time and bought good things there.

We have safe trip because we have an good driver.

Thanks to your assistance on this trip."
"I personally like this place more than Great Wall... Since they only allowed 80,000 people a day, even when we were there during the golden week, it was not that crowded inside. More people actually made me feel that I am in CHINA..."
Well worth seeing. There are a lot of stairs. It will take the whole day to see everything. The architecture is amazing. It only cost $60 hkd.
"I'm a little ambivalent about writing this review because it will be buried within a day or two. Despite barely being in the top ten of Things to Do in Beijing, most every tourist visits this place. For such an enormous city, Beijing does not offer much in the way of tourism opportunities. Yes, there you can go shopping, though that's largely the same as any other big city. The dining experience can be quite different, I will admit. But otherwise, there's not much that's unique. The Olympic sites (Bird's Nest and Water Cube) are not central and are not really that exciting. There is the ""Maosoleum"" across from the Palace Museum, but most westerners don't seem to be into visiting it.

The Forbidden City is worth visiting, but you must approach it with curbed expectations. This site is an important part of Chinese culture, so it will probably be full of, unsurprisingly, mostly Chinese visitors. Getting there early in the day helped us. Also, the place is enormous, thus be ready to walk forever, figuratively.

I enjoy the dichotomy of the giant squares and over sized temples when compared to some of the small gardens and private residence areas. Most disappointing for me is the lack of ""everyday objects"" from the period. Most of the good stuff is in Taipei at the national museum there (a 6-star site, in my opinion). For the most part, visiting the Palace Museum means seeing the architecture, amazing in its own right.

One big plus here is the plethora of snack vendors. If it is sunny and warm, you will be buying water and ice cream by the arm load. The good news is that the prices are quite reasonable, at least to western eyes. None of the inflated pricing you get at western movie theaters, sports arenas, zoos, etc.

All in all worth the visit. Wear great shoes, get your timing right, and plan to spend the evening sitting down somewhere you can relax and recover."
Remember your ID as you will need it to purchase tickets. Don't be put off by queues as it moves quickly. Such an impressive site. Make sure you have comfortable shoes on as you will do a lot of walking. Fascinating and beautiful. Ignore the rickshaw riders as they will try and con you.
"It seems hard to think that one man, the emperor would think himself important enough to warrant such a space, so many staff and such a self centered life.

By an large a lot of them did for over 2,200 years.

We entered via Tiananmen Square which was simple. You need to be fit, there's a lot of walking and a lot to see and it certainly helps you understand why the Chinese revolted.

Everywhere is kept clean, the buildings are well preserved and it is a fascinating place

As you leave by the North gate be sure to cross the road and climb the steps to get a fabulous view which really shows how vast the Forbidden city is. It's a lot of steps so take your time. It's worth the effort.

You really need a good guide to help you understand the importance and role each building played in the daily life of a huge palace and in turn the entire population of a vast country.

I was lucky to have the boss! Jessie from Tours by Jessie. (Avoid any other similar names, Jessie is currently no2 and deserves it) The tour wasn't rushed, it felt fresh (she probably shows the square and old city 2 or 3 times a week!)

Take water, strong shoes and don't mind pushing in in front of the Chinese, they will!"
This place is huge and magnificent. Whilst it is very noisy and touristy it can't be helped. And the place is so large it took us four hours and we still didn't see anything. Really fun to walk around slowly and take your time exploring.
"It is quite an experience to walk from Tina-min Square into the city. You go through one palace after palace. They start to look the same. This is where having a guide is important to explain the differences, the symbolism and cultural backgrounds."
Very interesting historically and visually. Takes a lot of effort to walk it end to end. Rest up before going!
This place is huge. It's almost impossible to cover the whole place. The palace is full of people. Very nice architectural.
"Another potentially stunning attraction that has to be shared with the masses, which is understandable but less enjoyable and spoilt again a bit by the Beijing smog. Our guide was brilliant and kept us entertained with fascinating stories of past Emperors."
"This is an amazing historic peace of China's history and thrones.
If you like and appreciate history and old architecture, this is a must place for you to see.
Be ready for a huge amount of people with you at the place, it's quite an experience of its own."
We had a day tour booked and this was stop off. I wasn't to excited about here. Boy was I wrong. Our guide (only 2 of us) very knowledgable and knew where to go and what to see. The buildings are spectacular. Take the time to soak it all in. As it is a tourist spot personal space is not available. So much to see so much to learn and wear comfy shoes as it is a bit of a walk around.
"Royal palace with huge historical significance. You can not afford to miss this, if you are in Beijing. Go with the local tour guide, who can tell you many stories related to Forbidden City and dont forget your camera. There will be many photo opportunities."
You probably have some knowladge about the forbidden city but visiting it gives youth another view of life in the past. Knowing that there are parts only certain people could have enter and parts no one could have walked in or out from give youth a different perspective on power in history of China. It's a must allthought no real treasures are in site.
"We had a great time visiting the forbidden city. The only negative was the large crowds.... The City is closed on Mondays, and so the crowds are always much larger on Tuesdays.... Plan accordingly...."
"First thing - totally underestimated how large it is!! So we initially started at the exit (you can only enter from the main entrance) so we had to walk the entire length of it before we got in! By that time it was mid morning and the line to get past security was massive! But it moved along and we got through, purchased tickets and made our way into the forbidden city! There is just so much to see if you want to see it all - there are many little temples on each side of the main complex. We opted for some of the side temples as the main complexes were just so full of people it was overwhelming! It really is a lovely historical site but it was slightly ruined by the masses of people pushing, shoving and forcing their way past you. But definitely a must see!"
"The whole site and city is impressive, there is no doubt about that, but it was so crowded and full, a lot of the experience got lost. In the past, only the emperor and his family were allowed in some parts of the city, and now it is bristling with people and their selfie sticks, it almost hurts to think about how everyone is mindlessly trampling on the many centuries of history this palace holds. I think this would be a great attraction to see with less people around, but like this it was just exhausting. Most were Chinese visitors and tourists by the way, not Westerners.

It's hard to describe, but somehow it feels wrong to exploit a formerly holy place and to hoard people inside, especially when you think about how this was so restricted for common people in the past. I feel that places with such a rich history and former traditional value should be visited and displayed with a certain respect, which is unfortunately not the case here with thousands visiting at the same time, it cannot be fully appreciated and experienced this way."
"Really nice and interesting place to visit but the crowds were hectic, a lot of people try to push you out the way so that they can take a photo.
Also, a few of the shops have nice things inside but the sellers inside can be really pushy if you don't want to buy something which can be off-putting."
"The Forbidden City is huge. Plan on 3-4 hours if you want to see everything. The main buildings, you cannot go into, you can only look into from the outside. This caused lots of people to crush to see what was in there. Other side buildings for you to see. Lots of people visiting. We went on a Tuesday, but did not have any problems getting tickets. Make sure to take your passport as you do need it to purchase your tickets. There were not many signs talking about the history of the buildings or describing their importance. The emperors garden was really nice to wonder through at the end. Have to start on the north side and exit the south end."
"This is a do NOT miss location in Beijing. When you think China you think of this location. There are many steps but in short amounts with large steps to take at almost all doors. This palace has 9,999 rooms and has the most iconic architecture. The buildings have been this way for 800 years. It is a very popular attraction and I would suggest you get your tickets early. You most show your passport so make a copy of your photo page and give them that. Lots of walking so give yourself plenty of time to view iconic history."
We were in complete awe of the history and size of this major attraction on our unforgettable tour with China travel. Our time was well allotted on all the attractions we experienced with our guide.
"Spent our first day in Beijing walking around the Forbidden City and really enjoyed it. We arrived around 10am and there were already huge queues. Be mindful that there are security checks and queues for tickets so it does take some time to get in. The site is spectacular and well worth walking around although it does get extremely busy. From memory, entry fees were not hugely expensive, possibly around 30-60 yuan. Leave yourself at least 2-3 hours to get around the site."
"Of all the sites across china that we've seen over the past month I enjoyed this the least. Don't get me wrong there are some great collections of artwork, clocks and ceramics that are a lot quieter than the main places but the main buildings were hell to put it bluntly. It's the third week in October mid week so very quiet compared to the rest of the year but the crowds are terrible around the main buildings as you can't go in you peer through small windows or the main door. I'm 7 months pregnant and by no means shy of pushing through a crowd but the people were terrible the force and rudeness. Be prepared to get angry and do not take children as this will end in tears. It's a real shame as the place is fantastic and the sites one of a lifetime so go and treat the crowd how they treat you, otherwise you won't be enjoying your day. They really really really need to invest in a few more toilet areas given the site size.
The main entrance fee is 60 rmb with the additional sites 20 rmb. I would recommended the clocks at 11 am."
"As this is one of the tourist attraction in Beijing, we went to visit. The place is well preserved and it has a lot of history. The major thing that fascinates me the most is to see the different room where the Emperor's concubines used to live. The dragons on top of the floors were also something that I relate with the movies I saw. In general, that place is huge and yes it deserves a visit."
We did this on a hot day and this possibly made it more difficult to walk around. It is steeped in history and with a good guide (which we had) can be made come to life.
You think a museum has a lot of historical artifacts? Not in this case... Just a few items left by Mao's intervention... It' s alright... But it's not real!
This place has some very very rich history about it and Yoyo Wang our tour guide knows it all wow and we were impressed how they preserve their culture and history
"To think it was not long ago that an emperor lived within the same walls and so many before him. To have seen this place in its glory would have been amazing.

This place is huge so prepare to do some walking. As big as it seems, only 1/10th of it is available to the public.

You get a good sense here of the vast space but what you miss is the true character of the majesty that must have filled its 9999 rooms. Most of the buildings are. It accessible and those that are have limited furnishings. Much of the treasures of this amazing place were taken by Chiang Kai-shek to Taiwan after the revolution.

Of all the area available, by far my favorite is the garden area. It is peaceful and beautiful and a vast difference from the more Courtyard feel of the rest of the palace.

We enjoyed this amazing piece of history, but longed for more. Have fun in China - Traveling U"
"This is a great place to visit, remember in order to buy tickets to visit the site you will need to show I.D."
"From books and movies, I had developed an impression of the Forbidden City and have always wanted to see it. I visited on a Friday morning in October. It was busy, due to being prime tourism time. I rented an audio guide instead of following a tour group. The guide was spoken in fluent English and was very helpful. The Forbidden City itself is phenomenal. The buildings and the whole complex is beautiful and just oozes history."
"We tried twice in the first week of October (holiday week in China) and within 10 minutes of opening all 80K tickets were sold out, so we couldn't get in. Since we had to stop back in Beijing for a couple of days on our return trip 2 weeks later (October 16th), we tried a 3rd time to get in. Well, unfortunately, the Forbidden City was closed to visitors after the holiday week without warning or reason, so we couldn't get in. 3 attempts, and 3 times denied. Very, very disappointed. This was the key highlight why we went to Beijing on our way to Thailand, and we paid $1400 usd for rush visas to China, but could not get in.

Be aware of tour scams promising a trip to the forbidden city, be sure it includes actual entry to the city (which is 60Y - about $10 usd per person). We found a tour guide who promised us he could get us in, even though it was closed, but we only got to the east and north gate, and to the imperial gardens, but not inside the city. That little excursion cost us about $18 (100Y), just to see the outside of the city, but no entry to the city where all the main attractions are. There are thousands of scammers all over Beijing, and they prey on foreigners. You can pay about 300-400% to book in advance through the travel sites, if you wish, but it is a great rip-off. Be forewarned."
"Forget everything you read or saw in movies (like Hero or many others)...

You just have to be there and be stunned by the size, and if you are lucky and the place is not overcrowded, by the overwhelming feeling of history.

Even if the place is overcrowded there is something there that keep the visitors silent.
No voices raised, no hustle bustle, just a solemnity that might seem strange to us western tourists.

It is all the more impressive...
I hope that the pictures I have attached will help you understand what I mean...

Don't miss it ...Would you ?"
"Really beautiful ... 9,999 1/2 rooms to occupy - breathtaking to imagine life (life of royalty) there."
Everything is big! Very crowded but it was ok. Important tip; you need to bring your own ID or pasport because they take your name before a ticket is issued. At several buildings you could only look from the outside; there it was crowded with lot of selfie-sticks. It is unbelieveble the complex and way it was architected. A must see!
difficult to express the majesty of this unique palace. All i can say it is a must see along with the Great Wall and the Terracotta Warriors in Xian
"Make sure you have plenty of time to see all of this place, it is massive, seems like you walk forever. Lots of history, beautiful buildings"
Visited towards the end of our tour and it covered a large area which was pleasant to view but not as inspiring as other sights we'd visited.
You cannot underestimate the size of this place. 1 km long but an endless amount of things to see. Expect long lines of Chinese visitors and tour groups. I was there from opening till close and still didn't see everything. I saw enough though. A must-do in Beijing.
Long walk between & around imperial historical buildings which are unfortunately closed for public. A huge area of gardens & courts. Intersting to see this land mark of Beijing in a sunny day.
"We went to the Forbidden city recently while China's national week was happening. So many people. My advice would be to go on a weekday and arrive just as they open. You could take some snacks or a picnic. You will be there several hours and still not see everything! The place is huge!

Have a look at a map/the layout online prior and make note of what you want to see the most. Wear comfortable shoes. Take a good camera for photos. The architecture is absolutely amazing. I wish I would have read a bit of the history before going.

For smokers, I saw a lot of no smoking signs inside and people seemed to be following this rule."
"We joined a veritable sea of humanity which poured like a river through the Meridian (or Southern) gate to what was the palace of the emperors of China. The Palace is huge and consequently requires a lot of walking to get from one end to another. It is a massively historical showing incredible artistry and skill. Unfortunately, there is a great similarity between all the buildings and my brain was starting to glace over before we were even halfway through. Should, however, be on everyone's bucket list"
"Get the Audio guide and you will not be disappointed - allow at least 3 hours as the place is huge, a cultural experience with plenty of history."
the Forbidden cities is very large and interesting. I didn't do much research before I went and was surprised that the majority of the city is made of wood. The layout is impressive. You move through the various sections with the buildings and reception areas. Everything appears on a grand scale. The only disappointment was that you need to select whether you go to the Emperor's private quarters or off to the side where the treasure area is. We went to the side and the decrease in traffic is appreciable. However the treasure is OK not wonderful. We enjoyed it all the same but perhaps you should be able to do both. The authorities want you to continue in one direction so you must choose. Very enjoyable all round.
"This is in the middle of everything! A very popular tourist destination. Glad we took the time to see it. Forbidden city does involve some walking, but nothing difficult. Pretty flat walking. Bring water and sunscreen if you go in the summer."
Scale of this palace was bigger than I expected. Crowd wasn't too bad when you go visit the area next to the center. I saw many romantic long red-walled alleys that I would love to walk around... Most crowd stay in the middle section so alleys weren't too crowded. I only spent 2 hours but next time I would like to spend 4-6 hours to have a leisurely walk and have a meal in the palace.
Our guide made sure that we saw all the sights of Beijing including the Forbidden City. Make sure you have your walking shoes on because this place is HUGE! A guide is a great way to go as they will know where to take you and avoid the masses.
"The park was overcrowded on a non holiday but since it was the weekend it had higher traffic. The entrance to the museum is via the Tian'an men square where you need to go in. We were confused as to whether we needed to check our bags as they had it on two corners before the palace entrance. Apparently this was if you wanted to go into Mao Ze Don memorial passageway which is opposite direction of the palace. After buying the 60 yuan ticket you can enter the palace museum which is vast and have multiple site seeing opportunity and can easily spend hours there. We didn't want to spent too much time but still ended up spending 3-4 hours there as that's how long of a walk the rooms are from each other. You get to see various settings from princess, empress, and emperor room to living room to main command center. This place has a big history behind each part so highly suggest grabbing an electronic guide via your prefer language (it's worth the price). After experiencing this you end up north and have options to go to Jingsan park which is another attraction. Beware of tourist guide outside of the palace. There goal is to take you back to the starting point of museum but also an option to tour the north of museum for a fee."
Crowded and you feel a bit like you are in a long queue but it is set up for lots of people to wander through. Audio guides an asset.
A wonderful way to spend a day and worth a visit. The old world charm and colours is beautiful and interesting.
The buildings were beautiful; They have preserved history in a glamorous way. It is definitely worth visiting. You get a good feel for Chinese culture.
"So big! A lot to see.
Come early to get tickets, make sure you go to the parts at the side of the park.
All the Chinese tourists' group only go to the middle.
The treasure display is very interesting."
We did this on our own. It was a weekend and there were crowds. It is much bigger than I expected. Save some energy for climb at the end to look back. Go early to avoid crowds
It is unthinkable to come to Beijing and not visit the Forbidden City. The palace is very impressive. It is always crowded and the waiting line can get very long.
Our visit was on their National Day ( similar to our 4th of July. ) - the crowds were overwealming - we saw everything but it was not easy. Chinese Holidays are not good days to visit anything in China.
"A must see, an amazing place, full of history. Not very crowded, if you go in the mid week. To enjoy, do it at leisure."
This tour is great plan to spend half a day here. So much to see amazing architecture. Beautiful throne rooms sculpture and art work must see.
"An amazing city with its history and meanings. Without megalomaniacs in this world, things like this would simply not exist. yin yang of life"
"You can't do Beijing without coming here...yes it is very busy in the main areas but you can always find a quieter area. The side areas are much quieter and have more character especially lovely are the garden areas. The exit is very busy with ""taxi's"" and people selling tourist wear, but a no thankyou and keep walking works well."
"It was like movie... Wonderful, wonderful place and we spent more than five hours to see the whole city. That was like you are traveling through time machine for 500 years ago for a moment. It is very colorful and so different of European culture. Despite lots of tourists, the place is in very good condition. This is impossible to describe, you have to see it, at least once in your life...."
"Great place, very long walk; during 3h we see 20%of all forbiden city; for sure is better to take good guide that electronic-with electronic you will lost very fast."
"I was only in Beijing about two days but wanted to be sure I could spend time in the Forbidden City. I was there during their National Holiday so I would say if you can avoid that - DO! It was packed. Tickets online had sold out in advance but luckily my great tour guide from the day prior told me that if I got there by 8am I should be fine - and I was. Once you get in the crowds are a little less crazy - because the place is huge. Yes, you will read this and know this but until you get there you don't understand. I was only there a couple of hours and barely scratched the surface. The one thing I loved was finding the gardens that were off to the sides - much more calm and peaceful in there. I will say the audio guide I bought there was a little iffy - it popped on and off and while always knew where I was, seemed like there were long spans of nothing. That said, I don't know a better way without a tour guide of telling you what's what."
Having passer the Tianamin Square next comes the forbidden City.Not crowded on midday.One of the places which is a must in Beijing
"An amazing place rich in suggestions. Avery inspiring walking across history and ideas, and quite a lot of physical walking too. If you find a good storyteller that is familiar with the place but seems to renew her joy drive you around, you enjoy it more and more."
We spent some time hours in Forbidden city and it was nice to see but nothing extraorinary. Of course woth of visit while in Beijing. Definitely take an electrincal giude otherwise you do not have any idea what is all about.
"Take Subway Line No 1, Tian'anmen East Station.One side is Tian'anmen Square and another side is Forbidden city. This Palace is huge and impressive, Tourist friendly, all signs in Chinese and English but very crowded so avoid going on Public holidays."
You need your passport to get in but make sure when you enter to buy a ticket go further down on your left and the queues are less. Cost 60 yuan to enter and 20 for an audio guide which runs oh gps- pretty cool! It is really busy but we got there just before 1pm and easily got a ticket! It is amazing but guess it more interesting if you are Chinese and the place is full of them of which they can be a little rude with pushing but best to laugh it off- make sure when you come out to go across the road the jingshan park to get a birds eye view of the scale of the forbidden city!!
"It's been more than 10 years since I last visited and if memory serves me right, it's even more crowded and the air is even more polluted before - but then I didn't have a four year old then. It took us more than an hour to walk in and queue for tickets - there were just so many people even though they weren't that harsh on their security regulations - by the way suppose to bring identity card. The view of the forbidden city is exactly as I remember from all the photos and dramatic interpretations from various plays. There is nothing like seeing the real thing - but the scenery was very grey and marred by all that haze!!"
"Unfortuantely, no one in my family knew that we all had to bring our passports to enter the forbidden city, therefore we didn't enter...
More than that: A tour guide, that we found in the street, conned us, saying that he could let us in to the forbidden city through another gate... he lied, there is NO POSSIBILITY to enter the forbidden city without passports! Hopefully, next time we will see everything that the forbidden city has to offer..."
"This place is one of the highlights of Beijing and should be on your itinerary. Bank a solid 4 to 5 hours if you want to be able to see most of it. Wear comfortable shoes, bring shades, water and snacks. I suggest you go early if you want to avoid the massive crowd. You'll still get lot of people but less as the tourists tours and schools trips usually come late morning/early afternoon. I recommend to get the audio guide if you are solo. If you are in a group, you can get a guide to better understand the history as you go from one palace to the other. Not all palaces were open when I was there. A nice gem in center Beijing and a must see!"
"Entered from the square though imposing gates along with a thousand other people and it just flowed, no issues. I waiting easy.

Then you walk in one direction through the front to the back. The first 3 areas are all formal, throne room, meeting rooms. Then to the royal quarters.

The maintaince is excellent and it just aw inspiring and something to remember.

I'm a Westerner and I was outnumbered 99-1 but it's clear the Chinese dress up to visit the palace as we saw many people from Tibet dressed in wonderful clothes.

I takes 9km to walk from the front of the square to the back but it was easy.

An amazing day"
There were so many people that it was half miserable. You aren't really able to walk into the buildings and look around. You and thousands of other people are trying to look through the window openings and it was just difficult. There didn't seem to be much in the buildings to even look at...
"Regardless of the day of your visit, arrive as early as possible. There is lots of helpful signage with English as the second language. An audio guide is an asset but the signs pretty much replicate the information on the guide. When we visited, some sort of VIP group was getting a private tour so the buildings were taped off until the group had moved on. The crowds were very accepting of this privileged treatment even if they had paid for tickets which should have guaranteed equal access. This is a very popular site so be prepared for lots of fellow visitors. The gift shop in the garden near the far exit is worth checking out. Excellent English spoken there by very helpful staff."
Really massive Palace complex with a ton of different buildings to visit. Definitely plan on spending most a day here if you want to see even a little bit of it. Bring food if you are picky as there aren't too many choices once inside.
"Impressive place! We went to the highest tower and got some crazy photos and also bought some bamboo pictures!!

Do not miss it!!"
"I was expecting a palace, as seen in the movies. It goes on forever! There are many palaces, not to mention offices of the imperial court. And at the end, a most lovely, tranquil garden. The scenery in the city is spectacular. Try and avoid weekend visits, and you need your passport to buy a ticket."
"Very hot on day of visit, lots of people but quite easy to get around, need plenty of time to take everthing in, we had a tour manager with our group so we had everything explained in detail."
"Forbidden city is in the heart of Beijing and some people consider it as center of the world. At the entrance you can see big picture of National Leader Mao. I visited city during Golden Week while lots of people from different part of China visiting capital and by afternoon 80,000 ticket been sold. It's good to visit during the working days as not to face problem with huge lines."
"A place of Wonders and such beauty and history , you could spend all day here , so much to learn about and see !!! There is an audio for many languages. We brought our child here with us she slept and walked a lot of it though it was hot and she slept a lot . The views are just awesome and every corner you turn is eye opening. Come here it will not disappoint!"
"The forbidden city is huge, a must see you will need 2 days to see everything. Go early, it will get crowded. One of my favorite sights in Beiijing"
Wonderful. Right out of a movie. Must me Sesn in person. My kids loved it as well. Our tour guide was fantastic
I've been here so many times. It's getting more and more expensive and more people. This is the most. I can not even the the temple. The king's dragon chair.
Very busy but well worth wandering through the massive city once only permitted by Emperors. Spend 2-3 hours here.
"This would definitely be one of the highlights of my Beijing trip. For me, it was the massiveness of the Palace plus the rich Chinese history it brings. You can roam around the museum the whole morning or afternoon. I recommend the clock museum which is an extra 10RMB on top of the entrance fee. I also recommend to get the audio guide (40RMB payment for English and other languages aside from Chinese) or hire a tour guide so you know your way around. You can get bored once inside if you don't know where to go. Also, lots of great spots for photo-taking, if you're that type of person. Once done, I recommend you go to this great little restaurant around the area for lunch called Little Yunnan."
Book online in advance to avoide disappointment and save queueing time to purchase entry ticket on entrance. Better to arrive early in the morning to avoid the crowd of visitors.
We came to the forbidden city at a national holiday so it was really crowded and busy so try to avoid visiting those days - overall really nice but if you don't have time for a few temples go to the temple of heaven instead.
"Very beautiful and impressive... but a bit of an empty shell. One cannot visit inside all the rooms... in fact, merely all of them are closed to the public. You can look inside through the windows, but as always in China, one is left with an outsider's perspective. A truly sad state of affairs... but what can you expect from communists...!!!"
"Nice place to visit when you are in Beijing
Takes more time
It was kinda boring to visit the complete place as it was too sunny"
Good place to visit to explore China history in Beijing. Anyone visiting Beijing should not miss this.
"This place is just awesome in every respect ! Take your time but try to blot out the hundreds of visitors ! Once you do, and it IS possible, well, I was almost in tears it was SO good!"
I have always wanted to go to the Forbidden City and now I have been granted access. It didn't disappoint. It is huge and there is tons to see and millions of tourists. I spent about 3 hours but was trying to cram sights in in my limited time in Beijing. You could easily spend the whole day here relaxing and imagining what Imperial China must have been like. Really impressive and an awe inspiring place.
"Always worth a look. Tickets are limited to 80,000 a day. I was there during Golden Week (first week in October) and it sold out very quickly. Top tip. Get your hotel to book on line.

A large site which can easily absorb the crowds apart from the pinch points on the central axis which are must see but there are some delightful corners worth seeking out. My favourite is the dragon frieze."
"Mesmerising place to visit take plenty of time and you will be blown away with this place,I recommend that you get a knowledgable guide otherwise you will miss out on so much of the history"
"This is an impressive big royal palace. You will find lots of history and beautiful scenery.
Information in English is provided which is fine, and not always possible in chine, even in big sites like this. To enter Tianamen square you will have to pass trough security checks even if you are only crossing the street. Top site to see while staying in Beijing."
"History, photography... amazing place. Absolute Must visit place if your in Beijing, even for a short time period. Its walking distance from Many shopping areas too."
I am speechless. Visiting this place is one of the greatest things to do in Asia. Entry is from Tiananmen Square (by Chairman Mao's portrait) you will then end up in Jingshan Park.
"The worlds most visited museum, and i see why. Quite apart from it being amazing it is clear that a billion chinese are also keep to visit.....

Its a pity more artifacts aren't still in place, and there is not quite enough info on the history of the place for me. This wouldnt matter if i could ""Google It"", but Google doesnt work in China :)"
"You just can't miss the forbidden city while in Beijing.
Make sure to not plan your visit while the country to be on national holidays (Twice a year, usually a week somewhere early February and the first week of October).
Also note that the site is close on Monday.

As a small tip, majority of people will enter by the main gate, while you also have a small gate on the east-side of the forbidden city from where you might avoid the long queue.
You can return to the main gate of the forbidden city in the evening instead to see it with lights and take photos, no need of waiting hour(s) just to enter through main gate, just my advice.

Just in front of the forbidden city exit, north side, you have a Park with a temple on the top, make sure to enter (RMB2 fee) as you'll from the top be able to see the entire forbidden city, which is a nice view to not miss while already there.

Cheers,
Alex"
A lot to take in here in a short time. Very crowded with some pushing and shoving to see in to the rooms Some of the rooms the main doors have been roped off and you can only see in to the rooms from the side. Some areas are also closed off.
"Firstly, my preconceptions about China and its people were all wrong. I walked from my hotel through the streets of Beijing to the Forbidden City (an hour walk) and encountered friendly, smiley, welcoming people.

Beijing is clean, modern and I felt safer than I do in most European and N American cities. Certainly safer than in Brazil or Mexico.

The Forbidden City is busy but not uncomfortably crowded. There are lots of people but everyone was polite and it's spacious enough to make your own way around and see everything comfortably. I splashed out and paid the 40CNY (about £5!) for the English audio guide which used GPS to play the relevant audio clip and also highlighted tours of different durations - very smart.

This is a must see in Beijing."
"Yes, it's VERY crowded. Yes, it's very, very big. And yes, this breathtaking palace complex is absolutely worth visiting. Even with thousands of other visitors and larger crowds than we had ever been in, the place is much more immense than photos can convey. The Classical Chinese architecture is beautiful and really gives you a sense of what the Ming and Qing imperial courts must have been like."
Impressive Imperial Palace in the heart of Beijing. It is a tribute to the Govt. that they take great pains to protect their heritage in this beautiful Palace. It is always crowded but worth the wait.
"This palace is large and needs a little imagination to understand how it worked in the time of the Emperors. The movie helped! Its humbling to think how advanced the Chinese were at this time, well ahead of the rest of the world. Definitely spend time there, you will need a good guide to explain it all, better than trying to visit on your own."
"To stand in the entrance of the Forbidden City and imagine the scenes from Kundin and so many other movies made here was awesome.....not to mention the incredibly significant history of this special palace. There were a lot of visitors when we were there often making it difficult to see inside the renovated chambers. Quite amazing architecture. An austere place to live, which is often the way with fort cities. The garden was superb and must have afforded welcome respite from the intense heat of summer. No water features save the large urns in the courtyard entrance which were supposedly filled with water in case of fire. An imposing place."
"Sure it is a popular spot and there are lots of people, but don't be discouraged. The history, beauty, and immense size of the place make it a must do for any visit to Beijing."
"This place is amazing! I can only imagine how the emperor, servants and his 200+ wives used to roam around the entire vicinity, it's a real sight to see. Upon entering, it was a bit overwhelming due to the large crowds, but the entire process was done swiftly and we were inside the gates in no time at all. I suggest you purchase your tickets in advance if you're not a fan of waiting in line. Although this wonderful place gets a large amount of visitor each day, once you enter the gates you'll be surprised on how massive this place really is. If you're a video game fanatic like myself, it reminded of the game mortal combat were the stages in each level gets you closer to boss level. It's the same concept here, except the last level leads you to the emperor, unless you end up killing his decoy, but let your guides tell about that.

I have only one suggestion, listen to your guides and then take pictures after. They give you an ample amount of time to take pictures. The guides have wonderful insights and are very knowledgeable, use it to your advantage. I noticed the the people in my group were so dumbfounded, immediately grabbed their cameras and wondered off. Later that day, they were so disappointed of the fact that they didn't get to take a photo of the emperors room because they were completely oblivious to what was going on around them. Don't be one of THOSE people!

Thats it! Enjoy your time at the forbidden city!! It won't disappoint!"
"From Tienanmen Square you just literally cross the road to the Forbidden City. It is huge and awesome and a must see. the temples just keep coming, each one so very beautiful and awesome....you just keep walking and keep seeing amazing temples..."
"A must see when you in Beijing. Unique and special among palaces in the world. Only big walls and roofs there. Everything that could be moved was removed. Very busy, crowded, stuffy, needs patience to visit that place."
"This was the first sight we saw in Beijing, and it was truly amazing. Despite the crowds and the heat, we were thunderstruck by this breathtaking Palace, building and grounds. It is almost too big and beautiful to be real!!"
"Finally I was able to visit Forbidden City in the latest trip to Beijing! What a wonderful place, vast, expansive, very tourist friendly and well maintained! Foreigners can use Audio guide which is GPRS enabled, it's really great! All the time one keeps wondering how it must have been built some 600 years ago! Just too great!"
"Arrive early, when I mean early be there when the ticket office opens at 8.30am. We went twice before and didn't realise you needed passports so couldn't get in and the next day we went a bit later and 80,000 tickets had been sold and it was sold out. Great experience throughly enjoyed looking around, audio digital guide wasn't the best, if I returned I would get an actual English guide to take me around. I felt like the digital audio guide did not talk to you enough. However this didn't dampen my amazement when inside."
every step you take is like passing past journey. so beautiful amazing architecture. spend over couple of months every day i went for walk here.
"Walking in through the front door was spectacular. Be warned there is a security check to get in and you will need your passport. It is absolutely well worth seeing, however guides say you need 5 hours to see it properly, we had 2 hours and it was sufficient."
"I enjoyed this site, though didn't get a chance to see everything. The palace is slowly being restored and more rooms seemed to be revealed with time. I recommend going in the afternoon because it was less crowded."
"We arrived at 11am on a Sunday and the place was packed! It was not a pleasant experience and the shine was taken off it a little as a result. Trying to take pictures with a crowd of people pushing me out of the way is not my idea of fun.

I would have loved to 'wander through the buildings and marvel at the architecture' but there were too many people and not enough time.

However! As a tick off the bucket list the place is astounding and I am pleased that we went."
"Mammoth in size. Lots of walking. Lots to learn and experience.
Beijing has lots of culture, history and monuments"
Another landmark we had only seen before in old films but what a place... the huge size of the site and the ancient buildings which have been carefully preserved and restored gives an insite into what life must have been like all those years ago
"Really enjoyed the visit. Get the audio guide, only 40元 to rent. Not enough women's bathrooms for the number of women. Had to wait 10-15 minutes to go to toilet. I would bring toilet paper and soap. Exhibits were great and there was a lot to see. Definitely worth the visit."
"This place is truly magnificient indeed. Infront of the Tiannmen square ,we were there at 9 am to go inside and truly enjoyed the 2 and half hour visit to this place. The audio of the system we hired was very helpful in understanding each and every part of the palace. The kings and the old culture etc were explained well. There was huge crowds but we were prepared by our guide well. After we came out the guide took us to the opposite side of the road in a garden and we climbed about 15 minutes and then reached the top to view the huge golden terrace of the forbidden city. This was a magnificinet view of the forbidden city. Truly majestic. The garden when were back we purchased some chinese feng shui items at 20 rmb etc. We rested for a while in the garden and got out from that place at 2 o clock and very hungry to go and eat something."
"This is a must see and a Beijing high point. As you wander through the buildings and marvel at the extensive workmanship, your imagination will take you to the time of the Emperors. The rich colors and carved white marvel and stone bridges and staircases are not to be missed. You cannot get into the buildings, but can peak inside to see museum quality pieces from the time of the Ming Emperors."
We had a guide and found this very valuable not sure I would of enjoyed it with out this guide. You need around a hour or 2 can be very busy
"It's impressive, especially the architecture. We overall are glad we went. However it's (not surprisingly) VERY busy and there seems to be no restriction on how many people are allowed to enter at any one time. I recommend that you don't follow the tour groups (that take a line of least resistance through the Museum); go towards the left and right of the mainstream!"
"We visited as part of a tour group and had our own local guide. This was great in giving us the overview of the palace, its history and stories however we were limited in time and didn't get to see as much as I would have liked.
The site is huge so there's lots of walking on uneven ground. Several people in our group had difficulty walking so be careful not to go over on an ankle.
We saw mainly the exterior of the buildings and their architecture. We didn't get to see many interiors. I was a little disappointed that there were not more areas recreated to get a better appreciation of what it would have been like, how opulent it would have been. Perhaps there were areas which we just didn't get to see.
It is definitely worth a visit though as it is a central part of China's history and one of the few things not destroyed during the cultural revolution. It is very interesting."
"I loved this place; it was full of history, architecture and important details about the Chinese culture. My only regret is that I did not have all the time that I wanted to enjoy all the architectural detail, history, and information about the Forbidden City."
"Great history, great day. Went with our Guide Angel with Beijing tours. Very helpful and sweet. We also went to the Great wall and had a fun time."
"This is a must-visit of any trip to China. Don't miss it, especially if you're a history buff. You don't need a guide, but it is easier with one especially if you are there during one of the Chinese holidays. Our guide was able to get us in without having to wait in any of the lines at all and there were very long lines we would have had to wait in. I loved every moment."
"Be prepared to a super crowded visit, is extremely hard to take good pictures but is worth the effort. I used the self electronic guide and was more than enough. I just spent 2.5 hours in the place but if you want to see the whole thing be prepared to spend the whole day."
"We were here just after opening and still didn't quite manage to see everything in this well preserved site. We paid the little extra to visit the ceramics and clock exhibitions - well worth doing if you have the time.

We used a guide book which worked well for us but if you're limited for time then a guide would be a good idea, if only to stop you from wandering off track and missing the main sites.

My favourite was the empresses opera house."
You really feel moving from today to history. There is so much interesting history in this place. Walking thru the city takes a while but every step is worth it. During my visit the sun was shining and it was not too warm. I highly recommend.
"A stunning place, but be prepared for crowds and a long walk. It's a huge place with lots to see. We had a guide who bypassed the queues for tickets so that was well worth organising. You get a real feel of the ancient places. Many buildings are not open to the public but there is enough to see everywhere else. The vistas are amazing from the steps up. Bring water and comfortable shoes as some of the areas are uneven."
"A trip to China is not complete if you don't visit the Forbidden City in Beijing. It brings history alive to see the gates, rooms, courtyards, garden, architecture and more. You can easily spend half a day or more. Fabulous. The renovations to some of the structures shows you how magnificent these buildings were."
A contrast to the Tiananmen Square... you are transported to the Imperial past of Chinese history... the emperor's seat and a sense of architectural setting that defies your very Humane perceptions.. a must visit and spend the full day there... mind the pollution as a lot of the walk is outdoor..
"A great tourist place to visit. You do not need a guide, as you can rent an audio guide at the entrance for a small amount.

Our hotel pick up was us paying for a taxi and our own subway tickets, we thought a car would pick us up as part of our tour price.

Our tour guide was incredibly knowledgeable which is why we gave it two out of five because next time (if we ever return) we will rent the audio guides instead."
I would have regretted going to Beijing and not visiting the Forbidden City. I wish we had had more time to spend within the walls. We were there over 4 hours and barely touched the service. We were there during the week and yet it was still very crowded. I would recommend getting there right when they opened. The extra 10 yuan was worth it to visit the clock museum.
"This a must see when in Beijing. We spent more then half a day there but could see how you could spend the entire day there. A huge site to see, all of the signs have English on them so it is easy to navigate without a guide. Some great history and great photos to be had!"
A must see site on any tour of the city. Very very busy and a struggle to get a good view of some parts but impressive despite that.
"Not to be missed. No guide needed. If you wish you can rent an audio guide that is GPS guided. This is at minimum a 2-3hr walking tour. So much to see and can be VERY busy as this is a national treasure to the Chinese peolple. Buy a ticket outside at the windows and then proceed to entrance gate. Tiananmen Sq. is a short walk. Take water , a hat for shade and comfortable shoes."
"A must see historical site if you find yourself in Beijing and have a spare half day. I tagged on a couple of days vacation to a business trip and with the fantastic help of a personal tour guide I got to see some incredible sites. More importantly, I got to understand the significance of them (including this one) not from a historical perspective (you can read that in a book) but from the perspective of a Beijinger. It is a huge site - that's well known. And like most sites, there are quieter times to visit and busier times to visit. I suggest getting there early to appreciate the place with fewer people around. Though it feels busy as you walk in (even on opening) the crowds dissipate into the huge complex. I highly recommend visiting and also booking a local private tour guide. Not expensive by UK / US standards and well worth the money. And you might well make a friends as I have done. :)"
"This is a must see place, but be prepared for the crowds and that it can take all day to see. Remember to take your Passport and you can get half price on all tickets if over 60, just ask for senior. You will read a lot about this place, so here are some hinds to make your visit go even better. With your map make sure you visit the Clock Exhibition Hall, you will not be disappointed. Then make a path to see the beautiful Nine Dragon Screen followed by all the halls that are near it. You will need a separate ticket for both. All of these areas are located to the East of the main buildings as you look North. Allow for an hour to two just to see this area."
Part of China's history. Great to be able to visualize the night occupation of its occupant with his 2000 wives.
A great place to notice the magnificence of ancient monarchies. Forbidden city is really a city with several passages and palaces beautifully designed with chinese decoration. You need at least 3 to 4 hours time to visit the whole complex. Don't miss the clock museum which is the best part to visit. Notice: Entrance tickets are sold only by showing passport.
"I was struck by the historical significance of this sight. I wasn't ready for the size of the complex however.
The symmetry of the buildings along the north-south axis is simply unbelievable in how accurate the alignment of the buildings is.
Just know you can't exit the same way you enter; you go east and cross the moat before turning back t the north or south again.
If you're here for a short period of time, make this one of your stops. You'll be glad you did!"
"We went independently and spent nearly 4.5 hours in this city and we didn't even get to see all of it. It is huge yet private in parts, swarming with tourists yet filled with quiet nooks and crannies, and has some fascinating exhibitions from the Qing Dynasty era.

Due to the size of the complex many people had brought picnic lunches but there are also snack stands and a couple of restaurants within the city. The distances are massive so wear good walking shoes and take an umbrella if it's a sunny day."
"You have to see it in person to understand the scale of this site. It is amazing. I enjoyed seeing all of the buildings, the Nine Dragon Screen, the Museum of Treasures, the watch towers and moat etc. I was not impressed with the Clock Museum."
We visited the forbidden city as part of a Wendy Wu tour and were very impressed. The scale of the place was well worth the visit
"The Forbidden City is a must-see tourist attraction in Beijing, but unlike the summer palace, Great Wall, hutongs or 798 art zone, I don't think I would visit twice. It's a sprawling site with a fascinating history, many interesting buildings and some nice exhibits (the ceramics room has an impressive collection). Concerned about the daily limit on tickets and wanting to learn as much as possible about the place, we opted for a 3-hour waking tour with Context Tours. Although the tour helped to organize our visit, if we had to do it over again we would have simply gone on our own with a guidebook and Wikipedia in hand, allowing us to determine the pace and see more. Afterwards, we walked up to the highest point of Jingshan Park (right behind the Forbidden City) for excellent views."
The crowd and the buzzing spirit make us feel the political importance of the place. It was a tiring walk but the undying spirit and the historical facts about the king's life were astonishing.
"The Forbidden City has been written about for centuries as a place of grandeur for the rulers, for which admission was granted to only privileged folks. Now it is open as a national museum for all to see. It is on a grand scale, and well worth a half day visit. It requires some walking to go the route from South Gate to North, and you can spend several hours if you want to look in the buildings, wander around the grounds and the gardens. But this is the central attraction in old Beijing, and must be part of your visit."
"The Forbidden City is a vast collection of buildings , gardens and monuments showing the home of the Emperors and its grounds. Very well preserved but very difficult to see inside the building due to the massive throngs of tourists roughly pushing their way to any good vantage point. I'm afraid you have to forget the idea of orderly queues and 'do as the locals do' and push your way to the front like breaking through a rugby scrum. That said, a fascinating place well worth a visit."
"It was of course big and magnificently, but it felt like that if you had seen one the palaces, you had seem them all because they look the same. My tip is to walk at the sides because there are much less people and tourist groups there! Would have liked to see some more treasures.

Was also bothered that you first payed one entrance fee, then you had to keep paying fees depending on which exhibitions you want to see."
"A good touristic place to visit. Don't need a guide since you may rent an audio guide at the entrance for 40yuan that is GPS effective.

Very big complex with old Emperor stuff but I cannot say it is wonderful.

If you go to Tiannamen you need to come here since its the high spot in this area of visiting."
"Again, this place is a must see when in Beijing...be prepared for a huge amount of people...Chinese do not queue very well so alot of pushing and shoving will be expected...pay a little extra and see the various clicks on display....make sure you visit the concubine section...great shops here and placea to have drinks"
"It is the most complete imperial palace in China. You can't visit Beijing without visiting forbidden city and the Great Wall. It suits those who are interested in history , art , architecture, culture and photos. Kids with families will enjoy making painting. I had a guide with me which made the tour more interesting explaining all history of the place. It is a history for more than 500 years of China. It needs 2 hours at least for the tour."
"We visited the Summer Palace on our last day in Beijing. It is a massive site, set around a huge lake. The buildings are quite beautiful, some having been restored for the 2008 olympics.
Well worth a visit, especially with a guide who can explain it all to you"
There are licensed english speaking guides available at the entrance of the forbidden City for half the money usually charged. Our guides wealth of information helped us to better understand the importance of all the structures and the meridian passing through the whole place. An experience not to be missed.
I think it would be impossible not to visit the forbidden city without crowds of people. It's exhausting. You do get pestered by people selling things as well. If you are visiting you need lots of stamina
The forbidden city is beautiful to walk through and has a length of 3.5 km There is a lot to see and quite a walk
"The Forbidden City, with its incredible history, the Emperors who ruled there during different Dynasties is a fascinating place with an intriguing story of ruthlessness, compassion, trickery, deceit, murder and revenge.Do not go without an excellent guide who can point out unique items of interest that are often missed. This is of course, an entire days exploration and tour. Incredible."
"This is truly a truly magnificent palace..... And it is Huge. Plan to spend half a day or more to truly appreciate the beauty, history and significance of this historic building.
Plan on wearing comfortable shoes and if you can afford it have a personal guide."
A really large place to visit. Plan at least half day to enjoy the entire spot. We have visited it with Patrick - a very good and professional guide from tour travel china. He explained us a lot of details about historic moments.
"You'll love it here if:
- you're fascinated with China's imperial history
- you're excited about visiting the former residence of China's emperors and empresses

Reconsider if:
- you have no interest in the imperial history of China
- you don't fancy walking a whole day
- you have agoraphobia

If you want to throughly explore this place, you're going to need a full day, trust me.

Goodness this palace complex is huge. Here in what used to be home to emperors, empresses, concubines and the rest of their households, you can find close to a thousand buildings. No wonder it's called a ""city"". It's highly recommended you read up as much as you can on the imperial history of the Qing (清朝) and Ming Dynasty (明朝) prior to your visit; you'll appreciate the architecture, rooms and relics you see so much more.

For an adult the ticket is RMB60 (student discount available upon showing valid student card). Apparently the Forbidden City is ranked as the most visited art museum in the world, so if you want to minimize shoving with other visitors through the security checkpoints at the South Gate entrance, and again when everyone is vying to get a glimpse of the thrones on the main route with selfie sticks and smartphones in hand, it's best to either arrive by 8:30 AM, when the doors open, or come after lunch (but then you'll be rushing all the way and will have no time to stop and smell the flowers).

Aside from bringing along your camera, make sure you've got comfortable shoes on also; there's a lot of walking in store. Fortunately there are benches everywhere, but of course during peak hours (11 AM - 2 PM) don't expect empty seats.

There's a restaurant at the end of the main route but food is not cheap. If I recall correctly the cheapest dish is more than RMB40. But rest assured service is excellent (they ""cook"" so fast, your food is served the moment you place your order and make your payment), and the food isn't too bad.

Also as expected souvenirs here are pricey. Heck, don't even expect to get a cup of coffee at RMB10.

Thankfully the premises as a whole are quite clean, the architectural heritage is well preserved, and the gardens are beautiful. Definitely worth your time and money.

A final note; if you've still got an hour or two to spare upon exiting from the North Gate, it's recommended to first take a picture of the infamous northwest corner tower (take a left and keep walking until you reach an area where there's a crowd of photographers with their fancy cameras pointed across the river towards a certain tower), then go back to the North Gate and cross the road to arrive at Jingshan Park (景山公园), which used to be part of the Forbidden City and boasts an artificial hill you should definitely climb to get a most spectacular view of the Forbidden City.
To enter the park it's only RMB2 per adult (student discount available upon showing a valid student card)."
"A must see! Historical site with a lot of history to be told! Beautiful temples that tell a story about the ""old"" city and emperors."
"The size is amazing, and so much history and very interesting, and get a guide or the head phones guide,it works on gps and so there is no and defo walk across[ well under it on the left when you walk out] and go to view point great views of city and forbidden city.."
"its great place to visit in China. Its one of the spot you have to see.
for History, for architecture, for culture, for understanding the past.

you d better get a good guide. i went with a poor in knowledge guy so i have to read more about it.

TIP: go after Chinese vacations. The crowd is because children un China are in vacations so families go to visit places like that, so its impossible to enjoy.
if you go after sept 1, its ok.

everything there has a meaning. colors, animals, structures, positions...

its a place with a lot of buildings for different duties. each one were used for some reason.

the bonsais, the sculpture un bronze and stone, the roof of the building, the floor, etc, are things that you will admire.

try to see details, but most of the guides are in a rush and they want you to get out fast.

you have to pay a ticket at the entrance and its like 10 Yuan.

you can see the building from outside, you are not allowed to get in to the places."
"Plan your day well, this place is massive. I loved every second of it, the detail and architecture is something you would only see here. I did a 2hr self guided tour and hired the head phones, the info provided is the same as on each write up near each temple/room so it isn't 100% necessary but i found it worth while. As with all tourist destinations there are plenty of other people, some rude, some lovely, but all very typical, but the masses are managed well and there are no or minimal lines. We went at around 2:30/3 so that may play a part. I highly recommend doing this if you are in beijing."
"We toured about a week before the flower festival but it was lovely already with the flowers that were already on display. So many areas to see, could have done with a few days!"
"It was a lovely experience, starting with Tiananmen Square, there was a a row to wait through check point but last for maximum 15 min , walk around with other people , 2 girls came to me asking to walk with them , they were chinese but speak good English, we spent 30 min together, I didn't trust in the beginning, specially meeting people in tourist areas , but they kept asking to go for a drink, but I found good excuse to leave them, same day I met. My friend and told me he also met with 2 girls in same place, so I suggest to avoid girls coming to you in the Tiananmen Square or the forbidden city

Don't be scare , China is safe country and Chinese are friendly, polite and helpful people"
"I visited the Forbidden City as part of a three-destination package with Viatours. I would recommend going as part of a small-guided group. This place receives 80,000 visitors a day, so expect crowds. You enter through the South gate and the hoards move on through the City and exit via the North Gate. This is a stunning attraction, as you walk through you can easily imagine what it must have been like hundreds of years ago as the home of the Emperor. Security is tight, and anyone venturing where they shouldn’t are quickly reminded of the correct pathways. In constant restoration some areas are in better condition than others, but overall you get a real feeling for the importance of this palace. Well worth the queuing and the wait."
Very crowded. Not a great experience. Flooring throughout is synthetic decking and they were concerned about Starbucks ruining the ambience? If I was the emperor I would want better digs. Long walk through the property and way too crowded to enjoy properly. Old lace bark pines gorgeous. Skip the clocks. Hard to visit Beijing and not visit this site but tempted to suggest that.
The crowds and crowds of people really put me off staying at this site. Hundreds of tour groups shouting into megaphones pushing and shoving constantly. I was left underwhelmed there are so many more amazing places of the beaten track that are much quieter and in my opinion more beautiful..but if your in Beijing of course it's a must see but go explore the less touristy sites.
"Most people go with a group tour, and they miss out the best parts of the palace. Simply most amazing to see what people just read in history books about this place and see the palace before your eyes.
But the problem is, it is also the most visited place in China, locals and international tourists flock this palace and taking pictures can be a situation of shoving and pushing. Especially the emperor's throne, but do what the locals do and don't be shy to push yourself through the crowd or you'll miss out. The palace is beautiful, architecturally and engineering wise is amazingly and cleverly done. I would love to come and visit it again on a very quiet day."
"There are few places I have traveled that have left such a strong impression as the Forbidden city and Great Wall. That feeling of amazement you get when you first enter will only happen a few times in your life if you're lucky. If you visit Beijing, the Forbidden city should be #1 on your list. Visit in the morning so you can avoid all of the tourists."
"We were brought here as part of our Sinorama tour and I have to say that with more information (a map, more background), this could have been much better. The complex is very large, and there are a number of similar looking buildings. I didn't feel that the tour guide provided us with enough information about the architecture or the function of the buildings to make it possible to tell the difference between them. You are not permitted to enter the buildings, and a lot of time you look at old furnishings through a dirty window, so it is difficult to get an appreciation of the beauty of these items. In September, when we went, it was really crowded. A must see if you are in Beijing, I just recommend knowing ahead of time what you will be looking at and bring a map."
"Of all the temples we visited, this is by far the biggest. Titled 'city' for good reason. It is enormous and of course functioned independently. It was fairly quiet the day we visited due to a national holiday. Be careful that you get a ticket for the museum as the first ticket office you come across is for the tower."
"No matter how much time you allocate to visit this palace complex, it is not enough. I recommend you do it fast and swift, and see the parts that interest you, otherwise you may spend the whole day there. It usually is very crowded and difficult to find your way in, passing through several security points. Allow some time for that. You may decide to join a tour group to make it faster and easier. Daily tours that also include other sites are very reasonably priced"
"You got to visit this place besides The Great Wall and Summer Place if you were to visit Beijing. It exhibits the old glory and past grandeur of Ming and Qing dynasties.

You need minimum three hours to sweep through this splendid palace. Remember that one has to enter from South Gate and Exit at North Gate, tickets are only be sold at South Gate. Taxi or buses are not allowed to stop in front of the said gate and they will drop you at Tiananmen Square, which is about 500m away walking distance to the palace entrace.

After exiting the North Gate, you must walk across the busy main road to visit JinShan Park right in front of the gate. There is a huge pavilion located on the hill top and you need to climb up to enjoy the panaromic view of the entire palace. Spend your time here during evening time is ideal to enjoy the sunset view."
"Entrance through the south gate after the security check. Have your passports handy as they might ask for them. Exit is on the north side, no subway there. Avoid the tourist traps in the north square (taxi drivers, etc). Hutongs with restaurants are in walking distance.

The place is huge, expect large crowds but usually these disperse into the large area.

The halls are amazing, but mostly empty on the inside. There will be huge crowds battling to see inside and selfie sticks fliying everywhere so be careful no to get hit.

The marble stairs are also amazing.

Take a look also into areas adjacent to the main axes, nice building wait to be discovered there.

After exiting, one can go to the park and climb the hill to get a good view of the whole forbidden city. Cheap souveniees can be found in the park, do not get the expensive ones in the forbidden city unless you want something special like jewelery or painted dragons.

Do wear good shoes, it's half day of walking!"
"It is one of the top must see in the town, but when we visited with our kids the crowd was so much that all you did was to follow this human river until the exit."
The size of this treasure is astounding and the workmanship is impressive. There is beauty and awe all around you. The rich history and culture of the Dynasty that ruled at the time is evident everywhere.
"Go early to avoid the crowds. Keep a look out for the ticket office marked English - meaning that is were tourists must purchase their tickets. It becomes packed with pushing shoving Chinese tourists by mid day. It is a vast complex and just as it states in the guide books you work your way through the buildings to the far end. It takes hours and as there are surprisingly few artefacts remaining can become overwhelming. What quickly becomes apparent is that the restoration job is actually a paint it all the same job. Get yourself to the Shen Wu Men far end and go to the right side of the complex to the courtyards of the Garden of Peaceful Old Age. There in those garden courtyards you will find buildings that haven't yet had the 'restoration' job. Look up at the walls and ceilings especially into some of the much smaller 'summerhouse' type buildings and look up. Lovely delicate paintings of what we recognise as typical Chinese landscape scenes, flowers and fishes. Some are almost completely faded away and are very water damaged. These beautiful paintings are marked with lines of the rain damage but can still be seen. Definitely worth going to look at."
"Everything I did in China was beyond crowded so imagine my surprise when I went to one of the main sites in Beijing and there was virtually nobody there but me. This was probably partly due to the extreme cold, but it made for some amazing pictures! It's a really impressive place, great architecture and statues. It requires a lot of walking and I recommend a guide or audio tour to get the most out of it."
We walked for ages before we get to the Forbidden city . Luckily Jassy managed to hire a wheelchair for my mum (85) from the beginning of our tour . We all enjoyed!!
This was definitely a pleasant surprise as I was not expecting the size and history of this place. The gardens are spectacular. Tianamen's square was also incredible.
"If you are going to Beijing you should definately see Forbidden city.

The complex of palaces is huge and amazing !
But it takes time to see everything so reserve more time for visit.

If you want to see all details and not be in rush I would say 1 day for it .
If you want to have more brief look- half a day.

You have to buy a ticket at the entrance.
As i remember rit is open till 16.00

Enjoy!"
"Very nice to see through the history of the Chinese emperors. There are a few artefacts there, but not many. The grounds are quite big."
I went on a particularly hot day and this activity requires a lot of walking. I also went solo and didn't take advantage of the audio guided tour which may have been my mistake. But by some point everything started to look the same and I just wanted some relief from the heat.
"The Forbidden City is one of the best sites my family and I visited in Beijing. The magnificence of the Chinese structures, art and very rich culture is truly manifested in the Forbidden City. We are very happy to have seen and toured this UNESCO world cultural site. 9999 rooms built and used by 14 Chinese emperors befit the word AWESOME."
"It's a must see place, but just for a short visit. Too crowded to enjoy, but you can learn something definitely."
If you go to Beijing you need to see the forbidden city. Overall it's a fantastic experience seeing how the emperor's used to live but it can be a bit too crowded. That said it's a must do in Beijing.
"This place is massive, it really is a city with many individual palaces in the grounds. Much bigger than I expected and took about half a day to walk around visiting the main attractions. really interesting place and plenty to see."
"In Beijing the Forbidden City is a must to see. But go early in the morning. In the afternoon the line to get in can take up to an hour to get through, with security and there are people everywhere, hard to get a good clear picture. Get the audio guide as it explains so much about the city. there are signs and facts everywhere, but it's just easier to listen to. Taked about 1 - 1, 1/2 hours to get around."
"It's the Wandering Yank here. I was in Beijing recently and a day's meetings were cancelled, so my friends and I hired a driver and guide and off we went to the Great Wall and the Forbidden City (read my review of the Wall at Mutianyu). Wow, what a day!

The Forbidden City seems to go on forever. The buildings (mostly palaces) are impressive of course. Unfortunately, at least the major ones aren't open to the public, but I understand there isn't much inside them anyway. One of the palaces you can see into and see a golden throne.

There is a moat on 2 or 3 sides that really sets it off nicely. There is a section of pretty gardens as well. Give yourself at least 2 hours, and I suggest you have a capable guide.

Be sure to book ahead! Our guide took care of it on her phone. Had she not done so, we passed a line of disappointed tourists. Not good....

2 enthusiastic thumbs up!"
"I love history and there is over 400 years of it at the Forbidden City. I would strongly recommend the self guided audio tour as it explains a lot of the history, meanings, and architecture. My favorite was the gardens. We went in the summer and it was packed and hot."
"The structures and areas they covered were immense. The history behind these areas, told by our guides, really gave us insight into the culture and power of that time in history."
Probably one of the most impressive palaces on the planet. Well preserved with so many details that one visit is not enough.
"Forbidden City is a huge place and one of those must see once in your life kind of places. At the same it seems that most of the inside rooms are closed off and only some have an actual viewing area. With that said it is extremely crowded and you will have to fight through crazy crowds just to get a glimpse inside or to get a photo.

Because it is such a historic place it is definitely something not to be missed but at the same time be prepared to be somewhat disappointed."
"We went here about 10 AM, it was full of local tourists, there were very noisy and unpolited. We spent hours on buying tickets. it was a good place to see but you had to go there early in the morning."
"The Forbidden City is just so huge that just walking up straight to the end already very tiring for some. A lot of the buildings have same sort of outside appearances, which decreased our wish to visiting all side buildings. Also quite a lot of people there so difficult to get nice private photos."
"This place is huge, but not much else impressed me. You can't go inside any of the temples and they all look pretty much the same from the outside. The courtyards are barren; some greenery would really improve the experience. There is a small garden at the North end, but it is too little too late. I exited using the East gate and was approached by at least half a dozen young ladies, who I can only assume intended to solicit me for something, but I just kept moving."
"Forbidden City lives up to its fame. It's stunning, elaborate and it's a must go in Beijing. The only drawback is the number of visitors, it can be really disturbing so I would suggest to go very early in the morning to have less crowd."
"I'll start with some things to keep in mind:

-Although it's always advised to bring your passport with you when traveling outside of your hotel. It is needed for this site and they will require it when purchasing tickets.
-If you don't have a guide, read up on the sites.
-Visited during Mid - Autumn Festival ( Chinese Holiday ) during the middle of the day as you can expect things were crowded but once you move further into the Forbidden City ( Palace Museum ) it begins to feel less so. The grounds are so vast that you can separate from the crowds if needed.
-Give yourself time to walk through, I would say minimum two hours. The area is so large and if you're taking pictures time can quickly begin to pass.

As a sucker for history and all things ancient, I found myself mesmerized especially at the entrance. It really is a must - see if you're in Beijing for any period time."
"Visited on a sunday afternoon so there were a fair few people around...the grounds are huge though so most of the time it wasnt noticeable. I was surprised to find out they wanted my passport number when i bought my ticket, I offered my Australian driving lisence instead and that was fine.
I'd recommend taking the ""route"" to the east - instead of walking the central line the whole way (this was the busiest part) go and have a look at the incredible clock museum (10RMB) and then walk through the treasure rooms - the treasure wasnt displayed amazingly and it was quite hot and stuffy, but there are some hidden gems walking along the trail - and extra garden, a 3 story opera stage, and a concubine's well to name a few!"
"Took in the sights and stories of this beautiful place with our English Speaking tour guide from China Highlights (Shin) I would highly recommend seeing this with a knowledgable guide as there is alot of history to take in here, I have also heard some guides are better than others, so be sure to use a trusted and well reviewed guide here! It is a fair amount of walking, but amazing to step back in time and learn about the ways of the Emperor!"
"Visiting the forbidden city is walking through history! With a good local guide it's a wonderful experience. There are a lot of tourists every day so my advice is to go early if you want to get the best 'photos and have enough time to see everything without being moved on by elbows! Pity you are no longer able to enter the biggest buildings, but it's worth the visit antway."
"If you love history, then forbidden city is a must visit. It gives you a sneak preview into the lives of the royalty during the Ming dynasty."
"First a word or two of warning. If you have spent time walking around Tiananmem Square which is itself very large (and on a hot day is quite energy sapping), you'll probably find the Forbidden City even more fatiguing as it's twice as big. You may also have to make a decision at some stage as to which parts of the city you are prepared to pay a fleeting visit or miss completely. There are so many Halls, Palaces, and rooms within the complex that if you are keen to see everything properly (in detail), you'll need two visits. If you don't have the time, I suggest you map out what you want to see beforehand, or book a guided tour. You can also hire audio tours for 40RMB.

The entrance to the Forbidden City, or Palace Museum as it is also called, is at the north end of Tiananmen Square through the Meridian Gate.The natural route to take is straight down the middle of the complex through the Supreme Harmony, Complete Harmony, and Preserving Harmony Halls to the Heavenly Purity Gate and beyond. Although this will take you about half way, you would have passed and missed quite a bit on your left (a Calligraphy and Painting gallery) and right (a Ceramics gallery).

It's not necessary to describe everything (I'd run out of room), suffice to say a visit should be on everyone's list. The authorities have tried to improve the viewing experience with lighting etc. but more could be done. They might also increase the cleaning staff as some of the rooms (especially the throne room) were quite dusty. I also noticed that it wasn't very wheelchair friendly.

After all is said and done, it truly is a splendid place to breath in the history. And if you get a chance later on to visit Jingshan Park, you'll get a great view of the entire Forbidden City complex. One final tip - take plenty of water, your passport, and wear comfortable shoes!"
"We really didn't enjoy the visit despite the historical value of the destination. It was way too crowded, with extremely inconsiderate tourists, and we never really got to see anything interior of the buildings. It'll be better to visit in winter, when its coldest! Then perhaps there'll be no one :)"
"Very impressive historical place, must see if in China, lots of walking, lots of people not friendly to handicapped, vast grounds, scenic, beautiful but a lot of the same thing."
"The museum gives you great insight to the long history of China. Artefacts, documents, art, all sorts of evidence of the high civilization of the country through thousands of years."
"This place just blows you away the history is immense and the place is absolutely stunning well maintained and a must visit if you are in Beijing.
We didn't take the main entrance but the one in the side after the toilets and the security check this will save all the mass of people entering the place and it's a pleasure to walk through the gardens ."
"This was my second visit to the Forbidden City and probably my last. At my last visit (many moons ago) the crowds were manageable, but it's ridiculous now. Only the exteriors of the buildings are viewable excepting a few token walk-throughs. The site is immense, but with 80,000 admissions each day.. you get the point. If this is your first visit to China and you are in Beijing this site is probably obligatory. Otherwise I don't think is bother. There's only so many beautiful red buildings with gold roofs that one can tolerate. If you do go, the concubine area/garden is a place not to be missed, especially on a hot day.

Tips:
-Go to Xi'an instead and live large in the imperial splendor.
-If you are in Beijing for a flight and only have time for one site, go to the Great Wall or the Temple of Heaven. Much more bang for the buck."
"Forbidden city is a magical and poetical place! In the heart Beijing it keeps magnificent buildings. There are so many details to be seen that you will be enchanted: the roofs drawings and design, the stones sculpted from one single piece, the arts exhibits inside the pavilions, the ancient trees from the emperial gardens, the small hill behind the palace... The sculpture exhibitions is breathless because they united sculptures from different periods some have 3000 years! The palace is stunning!"
I visited the Forbidden City in 2007 and is now greatly improved with a more structured lay out and more areas open to explore. it is certainly a fantastic place which does have the 'Wow' Factor. You do need your passport to purchase entry tickets.
"Lots of walking and gets very busy.Try get there early,again if you don't have a guide read up before you go to appreciate all the significance of the difference buildings."
You can spend over 3 days discovering this place.lots of walking and many interesting things to see but take plenty water with you and it's very crowded. I visited in 2012 and no tight security but on my second visit in September 2016 a lot of security checks (maybe because of the G-20 summit). still a must place site to visit.
"No words can really describe the magnificent and splendour of the Forbidden city, it's grande and architectural marvel to the eyes. You really need 2 or 3 days to explore the palaces with excellent artefacts located in each individual palaces.

Some reading is recommended before visit for deeper understanding of the history of Ming and Ching dynasties in respect to the building of the Forbidden City.

Not to be missed by any visitors in Beijing."
Excellent place but have to walk a lot. Be en sure of the shoes. The best time to go is September. Use public transport
"You will view the grounds of the ancient rulers of China and see how they lived, including their theatre, concubine residences, and gardens. Lots of walking....allow a couple of hours"
"Never ever visit Beijing without visiting The Forbidden City. Its a Great Hague Area surrounded by water and high wall. all things inside are ancient , you can feel the history every where. always very crowded.
please visit and enjoy"
"Love this place and revisit every time I travel to Beijing. Although the place is getting very crowded now with many places close for visit, I still recommend this a must visit place for everyone."
This has to be on the hit list of places to visit. Take a guide if possible to describe the history after all here. Well restored for the Olympics. Book before as ques can be long for tickets
"My wife and I spent the day there definitely worth the visit , lots of walking , great views of the city, plenty of areas to sit ,lots of history ,remember to take toilet paper , most public toilets don't supply,"
It is a good experience to visit the famous Forbidden City of the past Chinese emperors. Too bad that the interior of the buildings and halls are off limits to tourists.
"This is a very unique experience to gain understanding of Chinese architecture and also start learning about the history and the set up of the empirial court.

i do think that there is still room for improving and proving a more emersive experience for the visitors. But even with just the stories, it was an impressive experience.

I do recommend going there as early as possible, as it does start filling out as the day goes on."
"Was good and loads of walking. This taxi thing doesn't let any foreigner get on it t, they tell you to walk. Even though they go to the entrance and you pay 2 RMB to go through the gardens. They try make you walk nearly a 2km long walk - they are rude. Don't listen and walk to the ticket office and then pay to walk through the gardens"
"The forbidden city was beautiful with a lot of interesting historical stories behind it
But you only really see the outsides of the buildings. The insides are blocked off so you just stick your head in for a quick glimpse before being trampled off by other tourists"
"Probably better on a guided tour. Audio guide is quite good, but english signs not very informative. Some of the exhibition was closed, but there were no signs anywhere in english about this, we had to discover this by walking around trying to find a way in until we realized there was none.

Recommend to pay extra for the clock room and try to time it with the demonstration twice daily (we saw it at 14), it's amazing.

All in all it is a must see anyway even with the hordes of chinese tourists. Lines are handled quickly.

You must bring a passport to enter."
"We visited the Forbidden Palace in end summer, on a super hot day, but clear blue sky. We are speechless to see the largest Palace by mankind and really immersed in the history of time.

As Forbidden City is really big, suggest that you should allow one full day for the visit, and don't forget to climb to the top of Jingsan Park behind the Forbidden City in the evening to enjoy the bird eye view of the gigantic complex."
Fantastic cultural must see. Big tip watch the film the last emporer. Alot was filmed there and its great to pull it into perspective and tells you about its use and history.
We visited Tiananmen Square and the Forbidden City whilst on a group tour of China. Well worth the visit to say you have seen it for the cultural and political significance and that it is the largest square in the world.
recommended to those who has patience to listen to the stories of each hall and those who are fascinated with ancient architectures. not recommended for families with kids because you will struggle to climb up and down the steps.
How can you not visit the Forbidden City when traveling to Beijing? We hired a private driver and guide for the four days we spent in the city. He was excited to take us to this historical masterpiece. We had plenty of time to explore all parts of the vast complex. I was delighted to see a large group from Mexico exploring the palace and listening to their guide from China conduct their tour in Spanish was fun. Our guide was great and answered any and all questions we had. I don't know why anyone would skip this site while in China. It would be like missing the Statue of Liberty while traveling to New York from abroad.
huge palace complex with lots of Palace old Artifacts pertaining to Emperors who ruled Chin are displayed. The palace complex itself is very pretty. Try to go early in the morning to have best visit.
"A must-see you made it to Beijing, but the quality of the exhibits definitely lags that of museums in Shanghai and Europe. Most of the jade and brass jewels are covered by deep layers of dust, paint is falling off many sections of the city, and most of the palaces are just empty square rooms. The site has a lot of potential."
"It is one of the main attractions in Beijing. It is vast and impressive, but a bit boring. Once you see the first few buildings you get the idea and the impression, the rest is tiring, especially on a hot day. Very few buildings show actual items."
Very impressed with the visit. Imagining all the events that took place here. Important decisions taken by the emperors
"The Forbidden City is not something you can see quickly! It is hard to believe that something so vast could exist in the middle of Beijing. It is a vast complex covering 178 acres, and consists of 90 palaces and courtyards, 980 buildings and 8,704 rooms! It is impossible to describe the feeling you get when you cross a huge courtyard and approach the first building (which is only one wide room deep) and very long horizontally. You go up the steps to that building, then down to the next courtyard, up the steps to the next one, and so on. It is incredible that the entire ""city"" is so vast. The final garden courtyard is wonderful. See the movie ""The Last Emperor"" before you go..."
"What a fantastic day here, although I think we chose the hottest and busiest day to visit and it was absolutely mobbed. I would suggest buying tickets online before you go if you can!"
"While visiting forbidden city dont forget your id card or passport. They have to register your name to sell ticket. All of the rooms are similar so you dont need to turn every where but if you like to see all, it is better to buy a map inside."
"The emperor forbade the common people to enter, but we made it inside! Vast and open spaces so enemies couldn't sneak up, and extremely hot with no shade in July. Wondrous architecture and history in a breathtaking setting."
If you hate obscenely large crowds you will be very uncomfortable here but you still have to go. Remember that you are a tourist in a country of a billion people who also play tourist in their own country and this is their country's heritage. Western tourists even stick out here so if you don't want to become the tourist attraction make sure you have a guide that can get you through the entire cite. This cite is enormous and can feel overwhelming because of the sheer size but the history of the city and the importance it had in China for so many centuries is awe inspiring. If your a tourist in Beijing and you don't go here I don't know why you went to Beijing.
"Well, I guess it is not surprising that this place is one of the most busy ones in china. And this is also what makes the experience quite stressy it you are not used to thousands of people around you. Still, it is the forbidden city and worth to see it, it is interesting and sometimes you can be lucky and find a spot with less people.

If you go there do not forget to bring your passport and come early enough, if all tickets are sold you have to come again the next day"
"This is where history comes to ""Life"". this tours takes you back into time. This place is a must see. What a history lesson that came to Life"
"the vast scale of the Forbidden City is impressive, but my favorite parts are the side areas, including the galleries, where you can walk inside, see some of the fine jade, jewels, bronze, clocks, and get closer to where the people lived, with the small gardens and the theater as two of the attractions."
"9,999 rooms says it all! A must see on any visit to China. Be prepared to walk forever and try to pick a cooler not so sunny day due to no shade most of the time. Area is clean and big enough that crowds are not a problem. It was great being a part of Sinorama Holidays tour group which took care of everything from entrance fees to a guided tour."
"As was mentioned by another reviewer, many of the thrones were dimly lit and hard to see and could have been also hard to see if you were competing against thousands of other tourists. Best advice for this is to go late afternoon when they've pretty much departed. We took this advice from other Trip Advisor reviewers before we visited more so to beat the heat, but it was an added benefit to be there with virtually no crowds. We arrived around 3pm and the Forbidden City closed at 5pm. If you are quick on your feet, you can get through a lot of it comfortably.

Another note, I read somewhere that they spot check for ID papers (Passports). Not wanting to carry our passports in the streets, I photocopied our passports and VISA pages hoping that would suffice if challenged. As it turned out, every visitor was checked the day we went and lo and behold, they were happy to sell us entrance tickets with the copied Passport documents...so be prepared, or be disappointed."
The Forbidden City is something you have to visit whilst in Beijing and you must be mentally prepared for the crowds. There are huge crowds to get in but once in you have enough room to move around. You can spend a whole day in there.
"I enjoyed seeing the Forbidden city, the buildings are very impressive and the history is interesting, but it is very busy. There's actually a reasonable amount of walking so important to consider if you have someone in your group with mobility issues. Bring a hat + watch your bag"
"Very suggestive place, very crowed (but I guess in China is on a regular basis). You can basically walk everywhere but you can't enter all those palaces, which is a pity.
You can view somethinf from the outside but you need to ""fight"" first with thousand people in front of the omly available window."
"I have been there in 1996 and I went to visit the second time this year. I entered the Forbidden City at 2pm (it closed at 5pm). I borrowed the audio guide which helps me a lot in the understanding of different places/branches there.
The officials started to request the visitors to leave around 4:30pm. I then went back to the middle branches and took many great photos there becoz no visitors nearby!!!
If you are first time traveller, you should spare a whole day there coz there's lots of things to visit. It's the Greattest historical place in China."
"From the moment you walked through the gates, you felt like you had stepped back in time.
Having said that, it's still not what I imagined it was going to be like!

The City is Massive, I would suggest that you have a guide with you as there is so much history to be told.

It was great seeing where the Last Emperor was filmed and I can't wait now to re-watch the movie!

Definitely on you TO DO LIST when traveling through Beijing!"
So much to see and if you are into history and/or architecture this place is for you. You can spend your whole day here there is so much to see and learn.
This visit was extraordinary the first impression was the movie the Last Emperor your could see all the soldiers bending in front of the Emperor. Everything is huge and the colours are vibrant. We did the visit in a few hours but you could probably stay a full dayto visit this site.
Beautiful but the inside of the palace was almost impossible to see because no lighting and we weren't allowed to enter also thousands of other tourists blocking and pushing
"Very nice! It's a must! It was full of people. Really huge, with 18 different constructions. Prepare to walk a lot in Beijing"
"For the Forbidden City I would suggest either having a tour guide, or doing a lot of research before you go. There is so much in that city, and so much to learn! I think having the Tour Guide really made the experience better. The layout is a little confusing and sometimes the tour guides don't always get to the small hidden gems outside of the six main buildings, so make sure to ask about them! The entire city is really impressive. I wish I had more time to explore. A must see while in Beijing!! A Must!"
"Forbidden city also known as 紫禁城 , 980 buildings and 9999 rooms built in less than 14 years and was home to 24 emperors , this castle is still lively , from all the movies I watched and history classes I learned, the place took me right back to 14th century, my heart racing as if something is going to happen. Love every minute of it , Walked around it, in and out with my dad , we were fascinated how this place was kept protected , The future is in your history , you have to look back to see the future. When u plan to visit the forbidden city make sure you hydrate your self and wear comfortable shoe, because you are in for a treat 😀 have fun"
"Many people come to Beijing for this place, so it's a must see. make sure you have a guide our a recorded guide tour for the explanations."
The Forbidden City is something you have to visit whilst in Beijing and we mentally prepared ourselves for the crowds (we ad to go on a Saturday). There are huge crowds to get in but as ever in China they move quite quickly. Once in the city we rented the audio guides which were helpful. The place is vast and a bit overwhelming. When we were finished it was quite hard to find an exit and we ended up walking all the way back to the beginning before being told that we weren't allowed out there and had to walk back to the East gate and exit along the road there. It was a long walk back and there were a good few people who made the same mistake as us so be aware!
"Everything is worth in here of you are looking for historical.

Please be noted, that the total are of this palace is 32 ha. So if you want to round this palace, prepare your foot #lol.

Don't worry about the guide, you can borrow automatic guide that already available in many language. It is only RMB 40. Not expensive, it is very worth compared with what you get.

In my personal opinion, 5 hours is not enough if you want to round full of this palace."
"The site itself is definitely worth a visit but the crowd takes away from the experience. For starters, there's practically no lines anywhere so you have to push through everyone just to get a glimpse. Luckily, Chinese seem to be more wary of foreigners so they didn't push me as much. The museum itself is massive; you would have to spend an entire day to explore it but with the huge crowds even that may be impossible. However, if crowds don't bother you then definitely visit the Palace Museum."
"It's hard to describe the grandiose scale on which the Chinese emperors did things. The Forbidden City is no exception. It goes on and on, and you will run out of the will to see more buildings before you run out of more buildings to see. The front courtyard alone is massive. You can spend as much or as little time here as you wish. The history is amazing, the sheer size is spectacular.

If you're planning a trip, I would recommend not coming during peak season; not only is it hot and muggy, it is crowded. We came in early September and it was still pretty packed. There were often dozens of people crowded around the doors through which you can peer into various palaces/temples.

Definitely should be on your bucket list to see."
"I mean.. if you're going to China this really does not need a presentation, many people go to China just to see the forbidden city so... instead I would think someone who reads a review for the forbidden city is analyzing going to China.. they say the first trip to China should start off with the past, the present and the future. Xián for the past (the capital before Beijing, Terracota warriors), Beijing for its present (in the center of it all is the Forbidden City, on the outer skirts you can see the great wall, and Shanghai for the future... so visit China.. and don´t leave it without seeing this.. that would be just weird."
When we arrived I picked up a guide recorder. It plays in English explanation of what you see and costs 40 Y. Take your time and walk thru the center but at the same time check outside over st the wall sides. Less busy and more to see.
"Our group went this morning to Tiananmen Square, it can hold up to 1 million people. Mao Mausoleum at on end and entrance to Forbidden City at the other. Spent three hours in Forbidden City and could have spent more as it is so vast. Our local guide, Jim, was wonderful giving us the history then free time to explore."
The Palace Museum in the Forbidden City is probably the most crowed place but you must visit if you visit Beijing.
"I can't really add much to the other reviews! The forbidden city is big and interesting but there was no escaping the crowds! If you are not Chinese you'll need an ID card or passport to get in, I saw people being turned away at the ticket office!"
"This place is a must when in Beijing. But won't be a lasting memory. The queue was not as bad as I'd heard of (2h). But just the amount of people inside, was like being in a packed herd. I enjoyed the most the little areas to the side with the less important buildings as they gave you a chance to take in the place vs. be scuffled around with stressed tour groups all pushing and elbowing, poked by umbrellas and selfie sticks. Yes, the place of a place of great history...but simply gets lost. Tick the box, then head over to the Jinshanling park for some fresh breaths and peace and quiet. There go up the hill and get a view of the Forbidden city from above, that's really cool that get that overview.
I also visited the summer Palace which I felt is in the same camp of relics, and much more enjoyed it."
"Look it's interesting, and obviously of significance but forgettable. Lots of crowds, heavy going in humidity. The tour guide tried their best but in the end we were happy to leave."
"I wanted to enjoy our visit, however found the noise and the crowds overwhelming. It could have been better if we had payed closer attention to our arrival time, however we got lost on the way there and probably walked an extra 5 km before we even got there - not a clever thing on a hot day when the walk through minimum time is 40 minutes! I found that I couldn't see most things in the halls as the crowd was so large and forceful in getting to the front, which is the Chinese way but can get a little too much. I think I expected more of a museum than the parts which we saw, perhaps if our audio guides had worked correctly I would have enjoyed it more."
"The minute you step into the forbidden city you are transported back to a time when emperors ruled and palace politics reigned supreme. Expansive, grand and beautiful! A real peak into china's rich heritage"
"Very impressed by the size and clever ways of buildings. Had a private guide with me who told lots of detailed information. Very interesting layout and setup, surprising sights around each corner."
Tons to see. The electronic guide worked well and found it more than adequate. No need for a personal guide which were quite expensive at 400rmb and easy to get tickets yourself although need passport.
"Grab your passport ( VITAL for ticket purchase ) quick breakfast and get in early. The palace is huge and reading about it before didn't really seem to give us an understanding of what was here so we hired a guide at the guide station. It made a huge difference with her explaining layout, architecture and history and answering our questions. It is big and can be hot and crowded. Evidently the women's toilets are to be avoided if possible.
Our guide said that there are only 80,000 tickets sold each day and when we went past again at 2.30pm the ticket booths were closed. Chinese visitors to the Forbidden City are mainly from the country and don't see many white or black people. Just chill, go with the photos and stares and think movie star for the day.
Take your passport!!!"
"This was probably the most crowded place I visited during my time in Beijing, and my tour guide assured me it was relatively quiet. The main issue is that because of the proliferation of selfie sticks and parasols, it is very difficult to see a lot of what is on offer, as the rooms etc are viewed through doorways.

That said, the buildings and the setting itself is very impressive, even to someone like me who doesn't know a thing about Chinese architecture. The scale of the place is huge, I would suggest people considering bringing small children think twice as those with pushchairs seemed to be struggling and children on foot were protesting by about halfway through."
This is a very large attraction with lots of history and beautiful buildings. It is right next to the park which is beautiful.
The Forbidden City is a must do if you visit Beijing. For me it was impressive that the emperor wielded so much power to have a city built in a city. This is another place that is crowded and requires a lot of walking. So be prepared with good shoes and water.
"Ok. The place is nice and it has some very incredible sculptures and artwork but the feeling that I had was that it's the same thing repeated 100 times. I got one of the audio tour and it helps a lot because then you understand why it's so big and how important each place is. Also go early! I mean be there before 8:30AM. You'll need to go through the security check, get the tickets and another security check which can take forever when it's busy. Also go to the park on the back because you get a great view of the palace. That was impressive because I could then see how big it is."
One of the highlights of our whole trip. The history and the culture are great. We hired a local guide through our hotel to help us get around which really improved the whole experience.
Block out 2+hrs to walk it all. Also get the audio tour if you don't have a tour guide. It may feel a bit over welling because it is very crowded but it's so rich in history.
"Doesn't get much better, despite all the people and the scorching sun. One disappointment was that they had closed the Hall of Supreme Harmony so I missed viewing the big throne room (but with all the people that still probably would have been a tough putt). There is potentially soo much to see that really it would be too exhausting and overwhelming ... coming from a guy who loves museums and can spend hours in them reading every card!. This was a first visit so I tried not to get bogged down with minutia and just soaked in the bigger picture ~ am happy I did. One can read all about the details on the internet and perhaps even then have a better time relating it all together. We had gone through The China Guide to get our tickets and our tour guide Andy Zhao, which no doubt made our experience a good one. It avoided any hassles of queuing for tickets and wondering were to queue next and so on, because it's pretty chaotic with all the people."
"Be prepared to be pushed and shoved! When trying to peer into various rooms in the palace, the crowds are relentless. Still, I would not have missed this remarkable site in Beijing. There are 9,999 and one half rooms in the buildings (10,000 is reserved for heaven). And the great doors are covered in 9 x 9 bolts (again, 10 x 10 would be heaven) through which only the emperor could pass. The history is fascinating. The architecture remarkable. But do be prepared for large, pressing crowds and a good deal of walking!"
"Very crowded. I was told 40,000 people visit it every day. Very large. People do push you as you try to take photos of some rooms but, given the history of the City, it is worth the inconvenience."
"The Forbidden City is of course an absolute must for a first visit to Beijing. However, do remember to bring your passport on you, because the tickets are sold on an ID registration basis and they will need to take down your passport number. Guidebooks seldom warn you about this. In our case they accepted a paper copy of the passport."
"The forbidden city was much bigger than I thought
Our guide gave us a lot of information as we walked around
All the buildings were very well preserved though we could only see in a couple of rooms from the outside
It was very crowded but we managed to get round everything
I would recommend wearing a hat on hot days
We took a couple of hours to see all the palaces and the museum
The gardens were lovely"
"Had a great time walking around. A lot to take in and see. Make sure to hire a guide with an earpiece, not a megaphone. Go early to avoid the crowds and heat. Bring your own TO and umbrella, you'll be all set. It was very beautiful and large in scale. Clean and a tone of detail, we loved it. Glad we took a lot of pictures."
"A lot of walking and people, seems to be never ending, got bit boring after awhile but worth seeing."
"This is definitely the landmark of beijing. I have personally been to a lot of palaces in the world but this one, in turn of size and the architecture and history definitely outshine the rest. The entrance fee is ¥60 and buy directly from the ticket counter at the entrance. Make sure you hire an audio player ¥20 which explained the history of the palace and guided you in. Beware of the street cons who try to sell u tour packages."
"This place is huge. It seems like a never ending series of courtyards that all look alike. The most interesting part was the concubines quarters and the stories that the tour guides told about it. Unfortunately, I did not see any buildings that we were allowed to enter, just peek in the windows."
It is impressive but bland in that all of the buildings are the same. Hearing the history of the place was very interesting. I did learn just what is forbidden and its called SHADE. That said you shouldn't miss it
This is an amazing palace to walk through. If you want to see everything it will probably take you like 3 hours but it is worth it. The audio guides are very nice and they can tell where you are and they speak depending on that. You definitely have to go but I would not go on a very hot day because you have to walk a lot and there's not a lot shade until you get to the end.
"What a jaw dropping sight, with beauty and history all woven into one. Unfortunately, there were at least half a million visitors, all at the same time. We rarely get to see anything inside the structures. You literally had to fight your way through all the passage ways throughout the whole compound. It would be better sitting at home watching a TV program about the Forbidden City. A really sad thing. I wish that the Chinese government could find a better way to regulate traffic of tourists."
"Many Chinese people have not yet visited this museum so can get extremely busy as there are thousands of them, A very nice place to visit and again little shade if the weather is hot so be warned."
"They allow 80K visitors the Forbidden City and it is huge. The main problem is that it's hard to see much as there are so many people there. We spent two days in China. If I had to do it again, I would have gone somewhere else instead."
"I hate having ""must do"" places, but this one you cannot not do it. Seeing the picture of Mao and the entrance to the Forbidden City is really, truly an impressive sight. Allow time and patience to see as much as you can. It is crowded, and very large."
"In order to take it all in you need a lot of time and energy. Guided tours will generally rush you through and short people won't even get a chance to look at some of the exhibits on display in the many halls. During my many visits in the last forty years, I have yet to see it all. Do enjoy it and upon returning home watch the last emperor movie on YouTube to see what you had missed . Enjoy it though,it is worth the effort."
"Visited the Forbidden city on a Tuesday, around 9/10am and it was a lot quieter than what I have heard it can be. The arcitechture is beautiful and I recommend you have a guide or an audio guide to explain to you the meanings and whys of each part. We had a guide and definitely came away with much better knowledge. Lots of vans around selling drinks and snacks. Would definitely visit if you like to soak in ancient culture/history and learn about the Emperors and their way of life. You can see the emperors throne still but all other things that were inside are all gone. Lots of steps and not many places to sit down, wouldn't recommend for someone who can't get around easily."
"The Forbidden City, residence of the Emperor's, dates largely from Ming times and is the largest collection of architecture from those times. It is huge and could easily warrant a full day's attention but we found it tiring and left, not having seen it all, after three to four hours. The scale of it means a lot of walking but the really tiring thing is that there is a ""wow"" at every turn. Try not to miss the Dragon throne, the Nine Dragon's Screen, the Opera House and the Imperial Gardens. This is not only one of the best attractions anywhere but at £7 it is one of the best value too. Even the ice cream is not expensive!"
"Very touristy, but one of those sites that you have to tick off your list of things to do.

Don't forget your passport (and student ID) and leave enough time to visit the more hidden parts in the back - garden and small palaces). If you want to see treasure room and other special exhibitions, you have to buy an extra ticket"
It's a must in capital city Beijing try to visit the attraction early so you can skip long queue and it's centrally located in downtown beijing
"This is my fourth visit in nine years. I see the most in my 2007 visit. Many areas are barricaded. I don't blame them. The number of visitors is crazy. Just the walking on its grounds erode many steps and tiles. Curious hands like to touch bronze and brass fittings. They get polished so much they shine like mirrors.
But it's a significant part of history. A vast exhibit of architecture. A visit to Beijing is incomplete without."
"Such a grand place. Built on a massive scale which makes it unmistakably impressive but somehow lacking that little extra!

We made the mistake of going at the weekend and it was jam packed! So many people with no room to move, just shoving past each other to get places. What makes it worse is that many sections seemed to be closed so that was a little disappointing.

Definitely worth a visit if only to say you have been and you saw!"
"Leave at least half a day to get through the whole thing. It's crowded at places but MASSIVE and overwhelming in the best way. I would definitely buy the audio tour--without it, you will have no clue what anything is.

Also, there is a garden on the right side before you actually go into the forbidden city. It was incredibly quiet and empty. There were these beautiful buildings that I would definitely recommend exploring. Great way to escape the throngs of people in Tiananmen Square and the outer area of the forbidden city.

I would definitely recommend paying the extra to see the smaller temples as well."
"When you get inside the Forbidden City, you are amazed at how big it is and how it is split into sections, where dependant on your standing decides on how far you were permitted to go."
If I was Chinese I'd be embarrassed to have my country's treasures exposed to the public in such a filthy place and all in need of polishing.
We stayed at the north end of the Fobidden City in the old part of Beijing and had a ball. It was interesting to hear the guides talk on the City after having done so research on youtube in regards to the restoration of the city- our guide stated it was never in ruins and is currently have repairs done due to age of the City. Most of the time we were moved along in the City until you got to the garden section where you were allowed approx 20minutes to wonder around
It is definitely worth a visit but is super crowded and architecture repeats itself after half an hour. The view of the city from the nearby hill is definitely a must go
"You could spend a week exploring all the open parts of this massive complex, of which about 2/3 aren't even open to the public. It's a mind boggling concept that it was created for just one person. It's stunning and not to be missed on a visit to Beijing."
"I was there Sunday and it was super crowded. Couldn't see much as there was too may people fighting for the same space... We also took the audio tour, which stop working in the middle of the tour, and despite complaining they did nothing to help us.

So it is one of those that you said being there, done that, check mark..... So yes you have to visit it, but reduce your expectations as it is not that great.....

Perhaps with a tour guide could have being better but for me it was not."
"This was the fist thing that I visited when I came to Beijing, I was expecting to be struck down by views and history, but actually this was the least intresting and breath taking place that I have been in Beijing anything else is hundreds times better like summer palace, temple of heaven, prince gong mansion even lama temple and Confucius temple are more worth it. So if you have time please go so that you can say been there done that otherwise choose something else. But yes go very early so that you will be one of those 80.000 a day that get tickets. The thing if you are in a group or can afford it get a proffessional guide, the audio guides often don t work."
"Must say reminded me of the film with David Niven. As you shuffle through the various Palaces, each one is higher up and more impressive. Some great photos opps. Couldn't quite believe I was here and glad I went. Very busy and quite oppressive with all the crowds. Lots of areas as I said were off limits. Not many places to buy refreshments and no areas to sit and take a breather with a cool drink or Coffee. 3 hours and it all looks the same and becomes a maze. That's a tad unfair, if you can step back from the crowd and take it in, it is quite amazing and some wonderful detail. Go visit, you won't regret it. Did love it but not quite the Taj."
"Must see for Beijing, the buildings are amazing. You can also get tickets for the separate exhibitions like the treasure room and the clock room, both well worth a visit. Remember that the gift shops are all individually run shops so be prepared to haggle, items will generally be at a third over the going price to tourists."
"I forbid you to go to the forbidden city; Unless of course you like to push and shove your way to small openings in the temple to see what's actually inside, or you are a huge history buff. See pictures for just how crowded it is. You do not get to go inside the buildings, just look inside via small openings. Also many buildings are extras and require an extra ticket. A lot of the names of the buildings and court yards had the word Harmony in it -- we found none due to the crowding. Sadly, we didn't get much out of our visit, though the grounds and buildings themselves were very beautiful. We look forward to watching a documentary on the forbidden city when we get home."
Allow yourself time here as the place is much more larger than expected. A truly amazing place. Look out for the very large pots which were filled with water in case of fire. Nice café near the end of the site
"Be prepared for crowds as anywhere in China! But what an absolute magnificent creation! 243000 artist to complete it. Massive expanse all with detail. History well later out. Bathrooms, refreshments, and shops well placed through out!"
"It's like the Wall, isn't it? It's just got to be done if you visit Beijing. The Forbidden City is incredibly impressive and imagining the effect on locals and foreigners alike makes you think. And for this reason I gave it 4 not 3 stars.

However, I feel they could do so much more with the site. You can't go into the buildings and after seeing one Heavenly Gate, you've really seen them all. It's a lot of walking to see the same style of building again and again. The audio commentary, when it worked, was good and informative. Based on GPS, it didn't always kick in at the right time.

Millions of Chinese visit the site and the crowds are huge. However, the queues do move quickly, so don't be put off by this. it is necessary to pass through a security check out on the main road before entering the City. This was a long queue on the Wangfujing Side, but approaching from the other direction, as we did later in the day, the queue was much smaller.

Overall, as I say, it's got to be done. It is impressive but lacked the magic, majesty and mystery that I was expecting."
"The Forbidden City is a must-see. It brings you back in History to an incredible era. Although it is probably more romantic in fantasy than it actually was to live here hundreds of years ago. We went without a tour guide, but there are personal as well as audio available in many languages. Cost is minimal and you can walk around there as long as you like. There are seats in there now which makes it easier if you need to take a break.
Hint: be sure to see the small alley ways on the side of the main area."
"After serving as an imperial palace for about 500 years was open to the public in 1925. It is truly vast in size and isolation from the city surrounding it. A large moat protects its borders and fifteen layers of bricks make the ground beneath almost impossible to tunnel into the city. A piece of advice is to arrive early as admission tickets run out by about 10am for the day. If you are a local, you have the benefit of ordering tickets online the day of, which is not available non-natives."
"The history behind this place is pretty amazing. However, there were exhibits that were not very well maintained and the ""gift"" shop was downright sketchy - I could not believe the shop staff were trying to peddle ""original"" artifacts from the Forbidden City. As if. Obviously fakes. The place is impressive no doubt, but could be improved."
"If you're in Beijing, go. It's got so much history and the architecture is beautiful. But as everyone else said, SO crowded and people are SO pushy (aka typical mainland Chinese lack of manners). If you don't like crowds, skip most of China. We did find a brief respite in some inside displays of pottery and other beautiful artwork, but don't expect non-Chinese signage. Maybe an audio tour would have helped, but after 5 hours you'll just want to get the heck out of there."
"Wow! What an incredible feature in the heart of Beijing, once thought to be the Centre of the universe. An impressively large complex with an elaborate security system aimed at protecting and separating the Emperor and royal family from the peasants. Pity that many of the royal treasures were stolen or ransacked during the various wars in China over the years. Despite this, impressive to view and gain a glimpse of emperor living in dynastic China."
"This is a must see when you are in Beijing! I can not put it into words, so I wont. If you are a little interested in history and culture, you will love it! It is grand and beautiful.

Important information:
- foreign visitors must take their passport for ticket purchase
- if no reserved ticket go early in the morning
- buy water before you get close to the area (saves some money)
- go not with tour, you can get a digital tour guide that explains everything (40yuan) or read up beforehand.
- Inside there are some areas with seperate entry fee but not expensive (10yuan) and very much worth it.
- Different pathways so even if you dont have all day long, you can visit.
- Can roam the city freely
- Always crowded!
- Long lines at counter (tickets were sold out at 13:30h) - maybe you can pick up tickets one day earlier or just go early in the morning
- Inside beverages are 4x normal price"
"I am a bit late on my review having been there in May! We went everywhere with a tour guide and it just made every site come to life. Having someone to tell you the history and stories as well as explain the architecture and buildings as you walk through was invaluable. I think without it, it is just nice buildings and grounds without a guide. The whole approach through the square is very impressive and then walking through what seems like endless gates until you get there was very inspiring. It was still crowded in May but seems like the crowds are oppressive in August. With all the history, I just feel when in Beijing, you can't miss it!"
"Definitely worth a visit. Beautiful buildings and a real cultural step back in time. Very large and can get quite tiring in the heat. Fantastic sculptures and stone carvings surrounded by the most gorgeous buildings. Can get a bit samey and when it's busy you do feel like sheep being herded around. The shaded gardens with trees that are hundreds of years old towards the end is a very welcomed respite.
We are talking about going back a end time to see the rest of it and the things we missed.
A big bonus is the view of Tianimen square you see from Tian An Men Gate looking down."
"The only reason it gets 3 stars is because it was TOO crowded. We couldn't get close to see anything, because of the crowds, but the outside of the buildings. Which were beautiful,the grounds are expansive, lots of walking. Would've liked to see more. Maybe next trip."
"having lived in beijing for many years and have given many many tours- i can offer up a couple of tips-

1- be the first one in- get there early before it opens - when you get it will take your breath away to see it when is empty of the thousands if flag waving tour guides
2- go up the middle and down either side depending on what u want to see-
3- exit the way u came in and head to the Tianamen gate - it needs a separate ticket , well worth the view

afterwards eat jiazoi or a Beijing noodles, maybe some street foods and you'll feel like a local"
First of all try to visit this place not in August at the peak of the summer. The temperatures in Beijing are scorching hot this time of year and the billions of Chinese holidays tourist pushing you around do not help at all. Make sure you manage to get a ticket with time otherwise you will completely missed out specially during the high season of tourism. Lots to walk and see around and lots of stairs around the place so this as most of China is not for people with mobility issues. It's absolutely spectacular to visit the entire area it just magnificent in architecture and rich Chinese culture and history.
"I recently spent a month studying in Beijing. Wrote a two page list of things to see and got through most of them. We went to forbidden city one morning. There were massive queues to get in. Then massive queues to buy a ticket. They did give us a student discount even though we didn't have official student cards. Many other places weren't that nice.
When we got into the city, there were vast open spaces, but if you wanted to see the actual things in the buildings there was a massive crowed. You had to fight for about ten minutes to see into each window and then spend another 5 trying to locate your friends again. You can't actually go into most of the buildings and we resorted to getting the tallest person to stick their hand high in the air and taking a photo so that the rest of us could see what was there.
Unless you are very interested in Chinese history, the stuff inside the windows looks exactly the same as the stuff inside the windows in all the other places, which are less crowded. If you are in Beijing for a short time, I would not recommend going here, but for a longer time, you might as well go, just to say that you have been there.
There is a park at the back, called Jing Shan park which has a hill from which you can look over the whole forbidden city. This park is a lot less touristy and a very highly recommended alternative."
Complex with the Complex. So many doors to pass through to reach the Palace Museum. Entry is chargeable but nominal. Can be very crowded on weekends including the ticketing. Should go with sufficient time (atleast 2-3 hours) in hand.
this is not a summer activity when everyone is holidaying and the UV index is 6 on 10. the whole attraction is very time consuming and the supposedly 4 star public toilets quite stinky and dirty.
"The palace is beautiful, but very crowded. For some halls was a huge crowd and it was sometimes almost impossible to see what was in the rooms. It is also a huge complex, so you can spend quite a few hours there.
Get there early, because there is a limited amount of tickets and when we got there at 10.30h it was already sold out."
"The Forbidden City was the highlight of our Beijing trip. It was fantastic. Walking through the many doors, we could how culturally rich the city is. Forbidden city is a must-visit in Beijing."
"Loved this place and the scale of the place is huge especially as it was for just a few people to live (9999 rooms can't have 10,000 as the gods had that many)

I just walked around with Disney Mulan in my head realising this was where the final battle ! Sad but true (and I did love that movie). The last emperor is probably a better choice ..."
"I know, complaining about crowded places in China is like complaining about the smell of meat at a burger restaurant. But especially here it is really worth menitioning.

Apart from that, the place is simply amazing. The scale of the whole complex is unbelievable and you find something impressive to see in every corner you look.

A visit to Beijing is not complete without a visit to this giant piece of history."
"Too many people is normal in China..I know... but the crowd in the forbidden city was crazy! And without having a tour it is nice to look at but you're missing interesting information. Unfortunately, I was disappointed about the audio guide you can buy which did not really give the information i was looking for! Nevertheless, i guess it is a most do while being in Beijing and it is not expensive..so why not :)"
"This is a huge museum/castle in the middle Of a city. Take a minimum 3 hours - this will be very quick. Its realy huge, but very nice. Be prepared for extended security - security gates and bag checking. Some parts Of exhibition (indoor) is with AC, but anyway on sunny day a hat and suncream is recommended."
"Despite being hot and crowded when we visited the Forbidden City, it is worth seeing this historical site. It's a very large area but our guide took us around efficiently. He also took us to a couple of air-conditioned museum areas to give us a break from the heat."
"Excellent attractions, must be willing to spent couple of hours to see this attractions in details. Be prepared for a long walk."
"You got to visit this museum if you are in Beijing, China whatsoever the purpose (holidaty or business) of your visit are. This museum used to be the Chinese imperial palace and started from the Ming Dynasty to the end of Qing Dynasty, overy 500 years history to date. In 1987, the Forbidden City was declared as a World Heritage Site, and so interesting is there are 9999 and half rooms being built which was just half room less 10000 and according to Chian Ancient Rule the 10000 was only belong to the imperor in that time. There are fantastic collections and most of them are based on the Qing Danysty but few of them open to the public today.
Security checking is very strict, but most to Chinese people and there are no free guide booklet provided, which is absolutely unbelieable and disappointed."
One of the must sites in Beijing. Take your time with the visit. We took 4 hours with a private guide to explain everything. You should not attempt to do it in less than 2 1/2 hours.
"A must visit when you are in Beijing, very very busy and you have to run the gauntlet on locals trying to sell their services as guides, very pushy. We had a look around then paid $2 to go into a garden off the side of the forbidden city and we found our little quiet place lots of trees, seats in the shade and clean toilets. Arrrrrr."
"came on a private tour and was just taken aback at the historical value this site brings, but was somewhat less enamoured with the smell in the local streets nearby.

and absolute must do."
"Just walking around the outside of the 10 metre high Imperial Wall gives you an idea of the amazing capabilities that humans had even way back in the 15th century. To get in was chaotic, I have never seen so many people, but once inside the huge buildings and squares will just blow you away. It's an endless maze of small connecting streets to large squares, each building is named and all are the characteristic colours of the Emperor, yellow and red. Some of the buildings are open but the only unfortunate thing is that you have to elbow your ways thru the crowd to get a glimpse inside! Definitely worth the visit!"
"The Forbidden City is a huge complex of buildings with park areas etc.

An interesting place to visit, but takes quite a while to walk around."
This is one of the must see attractions if you are in Beijing. Amazing how large the area is and full of history. A guide is a good idea for this place to get the knowledge about the history
"There were many people inside trying to see the place, nothing special but this place has been well preserved for tourists attraction."
"...and plunge in to the seething masses of humanity. I came here last over 20 years ago when there were relatively few foreign tourists in China: it was tranquil and I was left completely in peace to wander through the alleys and great halls of the Forbidden City. Of course you have to come here - it's almost obligatory when in Beijing. Returning now with my own teenage children, we probably had more trouble here from those in search of the ubiquitous 'Hilarious Westerner' trophy photograph than anywhere else in China (save the Summer Palace). One can only presume these are the out-of-towners who missed the 2008 Olympics, don't have a telly and who have only just made it to their own capital city, let alone the wider world. So as long as you don't mind being the best freak show in town, being unable to pause anywhere and having your children's pictures taken for every social media site allowed to operate in the country, I'm sure you'll have a simply splendid time here."
"This is a must see place when in Beijing! Load of history and culture relating to the place especially why China was inward looking at the time. Get there by 8 am to buy a ticket as they limit it to 80,000 a day! Half price if over sixty but need passport to proof. If you have time Visit the clock museum as well! Also have Peking Duck lunch just outside the DongHua Gate of the Forbidden City. See my posting for details."
"As per the title this was a huge endless walk throughout this unique attraction in Beijing, we started, in a guided tour, from Tiananmen square, be prepared to a long walk which, in a stocky warm day as it was when we went last week may kill you, moreover it was super crowded by Chinese tourists (pretty common in July and August due to their summer holidays), bottles of water in large quantities are highly recommended in such conditions :) all in all another must see attraction in Beijing."
"You cannot miss this. Very crowded but worth the visit. If you are a Chinese history buff this should be on your bucket list. It was raining when I was there but I did not mind at all since there are plenty of places to shelter. Not as perfectly renovated as I would expect, but given the locations immense size, it is understandable. Be prepared to spend at least 4 hours her."
"Made only for the Kings their queens and secret queens , its a vast area with lot of similar big halls. The carvings, designs are beautiful.

Tip: Be careful if you have company. The place is very very crowded specially on weekend. I was lost for 15-20 minutes from my friends . Approac the people in Police uniform for help and ask for announcement if lost.

Have fun!"
"We arrived at the Palace at 8am, the ticket office did not open until 8:30 so be prepared for the crowds of Chinese visitors - thousands of them. You will need ID if you are foreign, we had photographed the picture page of our passports into our phones and this was sufficient at the ticket office, because my husband was +60 he got in for half price and I paid full price of ¥60 so ¥90 in total.
The palace was very interesting and the map we bought at the ticket office was helpful as it had information in English as well as mandarin. We did our own thing but you can join a tour or hire headphones. You can buy drinks, coffee, ice creams and souvenirs inside. The crowds are massive (on our day about 50,000 but remember this place is HUGE) and the Chinese were well behaved compared to how they behave on the outside (no screaming or yelling). We spent 3 - 4 hours there which we found sufficient plus it was pleasant weather."
The details and art built into these structures was wonderful to see. How many artisans and artist were needed to build and create these monumental structures?
It is very interesting place. There are a lot of places to see. Interesting custom. There were a lo of people. A lot of people form other places in China travel there.
"The Forbidden City is worth seeing for some of the vast courtyards and expansive traditional buildings. Be warned, however, that it seems to have suffered since the Communist party took power -- some of the buildings are completely inaccessible, but due to the poor weather we didn't explore the complex as thoroughly as we otherwise might have."
"Come early to avoid the massive security queues that are required to get into Tiananamen Square/Forbidden City. There are only a certain amount of tickets available for each day for the Forbidden City.

Tickets into the Forbidden City cost 60RMB and again you have to go through airport style security to get into the main part. It's actually hard to see most of it because of the number of tourists that are there."
Truly magnificent splendour. As you walk through you will absorb all aspects of ancient China and its rulers at the time
"Our guide took our party to the forbidden city, it is an extraordinary collection of wooden structure with its beautiful ornate Chinese style of architecture. The place is so vast you need comfortable shoes to walk around, we thoroughly enjoyed it . Fortunately we had a guide who filled us in with the history of the place which I found very fascinating. A definite must visit, I highly recommend it."
"The whole forbidden city is an incredible. Everything about it is amazing, architecture, history, art and the sheer size of it. They do slef guided audio tours in English which i highly recommend getting so you can understand the history of the place and what you are looking at. Get here as early as you can because the crowds are massive later on in the morning."
"A person really needs to put history in perspective when visiting China and this museum just shows you why. In America we think of 2 to 4 hundred years as history, but here its that many thousand years. all of the tools, jewelry, and religious artifacts that they have collected is awesome. Its a little confusing if you dont know chinese history, but well worth the time to see really what ancient times may have been like"
This place was packed with visitors especially Chinese visitors. It was good to see heaps of local tourists but there were so many (tourists generally). Toilets were sufficient and clean. If you go with a guide (we went with Christine Lu Tours) it makes it more worthwhile because you at least get an explanation on each of the different palaces. This place is huge!
"This is a beautiful place. DO your self a favor and get there at opening time. The crowds made it somewhat unpleasant for me, but I still found the beauty and majesty of the place. IT IS SO BIG! Allow a whole morning and bring water and snacks and, of course, your camera."
"Arrived at ticket counter around 9:50 today. (Aug 25). It was surprisingly quick and easy to buy the tickets. (2-minute wait). We then got the audio guide, which I wouldn't bother with if going again. It's better to read the signs in the palace and the Lonely Planet, which has a lovely, atmospheric story-like description that puts pictures in your head (eg ""...the emperor would preside over trembling officials.""). Sadly, None of the Great Halls were open. We left earlier than I would like because by 11:30, the whole place was heaving with people so it all got too much."
"Get there early, large crowds abound. Get tickets in the large forecourt as the crowds build up the further in you get. I had the English self directed audio tour, it was great and would highly recommend it."
"Yes it was cool to see the Forbidden city knowing the history of the place, however, you don't see much of it. It was like a four hour mosh pit with our tour group thru the square and into the Forbidden City. It was a fast pace thru it all and you only see the outsides of the buildings. I was kind of disappointed that we didn't see any of the inside rooms as we walked from one courtyard to the next inside. There were times it was so crowded going thru doorways it was scary. I am glad I went but just be prepared if its summer it will very hot and super crowded, We went in July. I live in Florida and am ued to hot weather but China takes it up a notch! Now we say boy it was hot today, not China hot, but hot!"
"The whole forbidden city is an amazing and impressive place to visit. The dimensions are huge and it can easily take hours to walk through. The place is extremly busy, so you should go early and prebook the tickets in advance. A guide helps a lot."
"To go to Beijing and not visit the Forbidden City would be unimaginable. The beauty of its gardens, the palaces and museums, the art and architecture are a feast to the eye and mind. I go there overtime in Beijing and still see new beauty at every step"
"Great place but too many people, could not see much and left with frustration！I would like to go back again with less people and better weather!"
"Would be better to get a tour guide, u can easily get lost (like in all places of Beijing) and with a tour guide, u can appreciate the place more. Bring sun block on a hot day. There's gonna be long lines
Don't bring ur lighter! They will take it from u before entering the forbidden city"
"An amazing place to visit to see old Beijing as there doesn't seem to be much of it left. Huge, make sure you see the gardens as they are the highlight"
"The Forbidden City is one of the most amazing landmarks that has a rich history, dating centuries back to the Imperial rule in China.It is built by the Ming Dynasty in 1400's and a great symbol of the rich Chinese civilization.

It is the most significant landmark of the Chinese Imperial rule, from where the emperor and the royal family governed and ruled the entire China. It is a well- designed architectural marvel with varying levels of defensive walls and palaces and each level/quarter had a different purpose/significance. Each building/ structure has its own story and its is quite impressive to understand the nuances behind each one of these.

Overall the Forbidden City offers a great opportunity to understand and appreciate the rich Chinese history and civilization. its a must see place, if you are history buff

Note : It is quite enormous and requires one whole day to walk around and see the entire place.Unfortunately, I had a tight schedule and could only cover only 1/3rd of the area. Secondly you need a guide to understand the relevance of each landmark inside this place. So get hold of the walkie-talkies (Various language options are available) at the entrance to understand the importance of each building/artifacts."
"I was there in celebration day, which resulted in an indescribable crowd. Indeed, it is impressive to see so many people in one place, interested in Chinese history.
Greatness and peace building parks are noteworthy, as concern for the conditions of good governance of the country
I recommend visiting the days when congestion is reduced"
Walked 4 miles in unbelievable heat with nowhere to sit or rest until the end. Did not feel that the artifacts were well preserved and displayed. The garden was my favorite area and had shade. It is worth seeing but recommend a scooter or wheel chair in cooler months.
I highly recommend Cathrine Lu Tours. If we ever go back to china I will ask for Jeremy and Mr Lu. We had a great time with them..
"A really huge area which deserves at least a one full day. Unfortunately i was a bit restricted with my schedule, so had to walk it all around in a few hours. An impressive symbol of Chinese power some centuries ago. An absolute must visit once you are in Bejing."
"The Forbidden City represents the impact of a culture of many centuries (or millennia) that this country has influenced humanity with. It is an extensive palace where the Royal Family used to govern from and live. A big percentage of it is closed to normal visitors but it is vast. Chinese art excels and adds to western art. China is an impressive country in all ways and throughout the centuries.

Tip: If you are traveling without a guide, be aware that the entrance gate is on the other side of the city as the exit gate. Make sure where the entrance gate is so the taxi drops you in front of it or you will have to surround this gigantic area walking. I would say it is easily 2 or 3 kms walk from one end to the other, if not more; so plan ahead and enjoy."
"The Forbidden City is the largest piece of the imperial palace of the world. It was constructed in 1420 during the Ming Dynasty. It was well- designed, with a special defensive wall, a moat and four watch-towers.
There are hundreds of palaces with shining roofs in golden color. Under the sunshine, they all look like shining golds, telling us the fantastic stories about each of the palaces. The Amazing history, the elegant architectures,and the fantastic souroundings, they are all attracting visitors to find out the the true stories about them!
The Fobidden City is a very educational museum to learn more about the Chinese civilization."
"great experience. it is so wonderful to experience China's treasure. please keep this place open for all future generations. better still, go watch ""the last emperor"" before coming here. you will enjoy it even more!"
"You can't go to Paris and not go see the Eiffel Tower, you can't go to Rome and not see the St. Peter's Cathedral... You can't go to Beijing and miss the Forbidden City (AKA Imperial Palace).
The country has been ruled from here for the past 600 years, so it's a historical, cultural and political milestone.

Tip: avoid weekends, national holidays, summer holidays, unless you feel lonely.
Tip 2: once inside, try to stay on the sides, less people and you walk in the shade. Once you've established where you are and what you want to see, you can venture to the centre.
Tip 3: between the political area and the beginning of the living quarters there is a little local coffeeshop with decent coffee and A/C (next door toilets)
Tip 4: be careful for the last (northern part) of the Forbidden city, the imperial gardens. They were build for a few people, but are visited but thousands of people nowadays."
"The centre of a psychologically complex relationship between Communist China and its imperial past. There's plenty to do in the surrounding areas if it doesn't please. A shame they shut down the Starbucks. It was great to have a coffee there and experience cognitive dissonance as ancient China battled modern USA in front of you. Plenty of great Chinese films used this as a location since it is so distinctive, and the site of many important moments in world history"
"This is a HUGE place w after you admire a huge square with a huge building, you,can walk through an arch with another huge square and another huge building. And so on.

To me, after a while, they really looked the same. I'm glad I went and I guess everyone should see for themselves. But frankly, it was sort of really boring."
"The Palace Museum used as the residence by the emperors in the Ming and Qing dynasties has the most amazing construction art and cultural art of ancient Chinese people. The beauty in the layout of the whole complex, the lush green gardens and trees and the vast grounds had us walk for miles on end. We were chaffed by the electronic translator that was so accurate as if it was counting the steps or the turns we made. It definitely made life easier. Forbidden City has been immaculately preserved. Very impressive."
Very crowded and hot bring a lot of water. we had a wonderful guided tour. But it is very tiring but well worth the effort. The buildings are amazing and the life of the people who lived there fascinating.
"We visited the Forbidden city as part of a tour. The place was very crowded (like constant rush hour in the subway) and people lacked basic manners.
It is however a must see and the place is both beautiful and impressive."
"88,000 visitors are allowed in EACH DAY. Many of those tickets are pre-sold to groups, so it's best to get there when the gates open. It was very hot the day we went and very crowded -- July and August are holiday seasons for Chinese, so they visit all the tourist spots then. We were fortunate to have some of the high school students we were teaching as guides. Our students live in Beijing, so they were familiar with which ticket booth sold which kind of ticket. We entered through the East Gate and ""escaped security"" as our students phrased it. You have to go through the long security lines at the West Gate. Our students shared all kinds of interesting stories and facts with us. Since most won't have the luxury of local guides, read up on the history. Afterwards, you can climb the mountain across from the Forbidden City to see how it's laid out. The Chinese are very symmetrical, and it's very obvious Forbidden City is viewed from above."
"Travelled there end of April 2015. There are several gates prior to entering the main section of this great historical place. I strongly recommend getting information on all the buildings before going there. I had a Beijing tour book with a map of the Forbidden City, the buildings and history of what went on in them. Bring food and water. Taking pictures of the emperor's throne rooms were pretty squishy with everyone trying to get a picture, but it is possible to do. I loved seeing the Hall of Clocks, as it's amazing to see the variety and detail from all the different countries in the world. Souvenirs were well priced to purchase. Certainly a ""must see"" place if you make it out to Beijing."
"Although the number of people allowed to enter it is limited, there are far too many people actually visiting it.

Make sure to arrive early as an independent traveller as tickets are sold out really quickly (make sure to bring your passport as you need it to buy the ticket), but wait with entering if you can as most guided groups will enter in the mornings. These guided groups are the main reason why the experience is ruined. They are just too loud and occupy the few entries of the rooms that are actually accessible with selfie-sticks etc. making it really difficult to get a glimpse. Moreover, there are basically three routes you can take: left, middle, right. Avoid the middle one as it's the most touristic and therefore the most crowded.

Although there is an audio guide being offered (40 rmb per person) we would not recommend using it. It has only one headphone and is supposed to work automatically, supplying you with information whenever you are in front of something important. However, it remained silent most of the time as it did not work properly.

Overall, it's impressive, but do not expect too much as a lot of doors to interesting places (jade temple etc.) are closed. Oh and male sure to visit the tian'namen gate (the one with the large Mao portrait) first as you cannot go back once you enter the palace museum. Oh and avoid bringing a backpavk as things just get more complicated (you cannot bring the backpack to the gate, but can bring it to the museum. However, you are generally not allowed to go back and vollect your stuff etc.)"
"The Palace is worth a visit. However, you have to be there very early in order to get tickets. You also have to bring your ID/Passport in order to get in. 2 of the 3 audio guides we rented did not work."
"Best known place in Beijing. You can´t miss it. It is awesome. Read some informations before visit or take a book, because it has interesting history. Long lines. In peak seaoson (July) thay have limited number of tickets, so go there in morning."
"We arrived at Tiananmen and walk with a big crowd towards the Forbidden city entrance. Upon arriving we found that the ticket booths were closed. There was a large LED noticeboard with some chinese writing. (Later i understood that all 80,000 tickets had been sold out)

Anyways, 11am saturday morning the tickets had been sold out. If you dislike walking with a big crowd I think there is a way to approach the forbidden city via the east gate. I'm not totally sure. Chinese volunteers wearing Tiananmen volunteer shirts were routing chinese tourists whom were not interested in the tiananmen to go through the east gate.

Disappointed we walked out the west gate in front of the forbidden city entrance, and we found locals selling tickets to the forbidden city. We didn't bother ask, but we were disappointed nonetheless.

Thus, don't expect any english help around, and your virtually on your own to find out what's going on around you. No english signs to notify you of any notices."
"The Forbidden City is such a historic place, it's a symbol of the imperial power in ancient China. Walking in the city, just feel like that you've already in ancient China."
"i would say its a boring place ever. and on sunny day its super boring. you walk a km and than there you will find a room says it was his wife's room, walk another km you will see mom's room, very boring"
Avoid the crowds by showing up at the opening time and take a route along the side of the town instead of following the crowds straight through. The small extra charge for a a part containing treasures is worthy as it has far less tourists and offers insight into cultural life of the emperor.
"I've given this a rating of three more because I could not decide whether it should be one or five! Yes the whole complex with its architecture and incredible history is amazing; that is indisputable. To that extent I'm glad I did it.

The big but is this: it was one of the most off putting experiences being caught up in a sea of people and noise. Not an ounce of serenity to be found. That was at 8:30 in the morning! I could not wait to get out and would rather rely on my memory of scenes from the movie The Last Emperor and the Netflix serialisation of Empresses in the Palace (Legend of Zhenhuan). But I can I suppose now say I've been there and done it!"
"As part of a group tour we visited the Forbidden City and we're not disappointed.
It is hard to comprehend how life would have been in the time of the Emperors and the different Dynasty's and it would be a good idea to read about it before visiting to get a better understanding of what you will see."
Yesterday we visited the forbidden city. It was a bit difficult with a double pram. This is because you had to lift the double pram over many things. However it was a beautiful city and I would've liked to spend more time there. Maybe in the future my family and I will come back to this place. People were very friendly and out guides were amazing. There was many places that you could take a good photo.
"It was great time to visit forbidden palace , wonderful arts...!! Carrying a long and Great history of great emperors. Amazing place for visit 😊"
A must do if your visiting Beijing. Lots to see n do and try try and understand how it must have been so many years ago.
"Be advised that walking is in one direction. Huge and very interesting to explore. There are many individual buildings. Don't miss the area where you can see into buildings. There are many stairs, ramps, and thresholds to step over."
"I got there around 2-3pm and the tickets had already been sold out to 80,000 people. You can get a rough idea of how many people attend this place daily, tonnes and tonnes and tonnes of tourists. I couldn't get in but I noticed Chinese people being let in without tickets which was strange. Somehow I did get coaxed by a man named Tony who claimed to be a tour guide promising my husband and I that he could get us in. I realised it was a lie the moment he walked us away from the forbidden city. However he took us to Jingshan park where we actually got to see the forbidden city from above which was incredible! I could see the buildings all looked the same from above so I can see how this could become mind numbing looking at the same thing for hours on end when you are within the city."
Go get your ticket early in the morning (there is a limited amount pf 80.000 people every day) but I recommend you to go later in the day. We were there around 10 am and the amount of people was awful. We couldn't walk or take any pictures and we couldn't enjoy the grandiosity of the place. At 3 pm everyone disappeared at it seems we were in another place. The tours were gone and we were by ourselves in the Forbidden City. Such a relief.
"We visited Forbidden City in August. I'd recommend going early in the morning when it is not quite so hot and there are fewer tours and tourists. We visited in the morning and managed to see everything within.

There is plenty to see within with lots of walking and you can look in some of the buildings."
If you don't plan to see forbidden city (summer palace) during your visit to Beijing you are making a big mistake.It is such a great wonder and we were amazed by the constructions spanning in 85 plus hectares. It is definitely a walk through the Chinese history and enriches our knowledge on Chinese culture. Please don't miss it and remember half a day is at least required to see tianamen square and forbidden city
"I definitely recommend to stay the whole day , there is so much to see, take a tourist guide! Again as the great Wall of china, March it's great for the weather!"
"The Grandfather made the money, the Father saved the money and the son spent the money. It's a must see. It's massive. Plan on a all day tour of the palace and the surrounding area."
Very crowded when we visited in August and extremely hot day. Beautiful to walk the grounds though and worth it
This compound is massive! We walked and walked and saw everything. Remember to wear good shoes and bring a small umbrella for sudden downpour. We went there during summer and it was packed with locals and tourists and very hot. Most of the buildings were closed so you can only look from outside. Not very many antiques as those have been removed for safe keeping. I can't go into details as there were so many to review. Worth seeing.
Great to visit .. be ready to long walks and lot of crowd. Lot of history and great structures. we enjoyed our trip here.
"The area is extremely large and our tour guide told us it was build to protect the emperor. If you watch the last emperor, you'll get a better sense of the history of the place. This was very close to the Hilton Wangfujing location."
"The Forbidden City is a beautiful imperial museum exemplifying Chinese palatial architecture. It is a very grandiose palace and has many pagoda's decorated with authentic Chinese-styled architecture. If you don't speak Chinese, ask others around you before queuing, tickets to exhibitions and the Forbidden City are deep into to the palace gates. The Forbidden City was named this due to it being a large house for emperors and politicians. But when the last emperor, PuYi, was gone, China had already become a communist country. For the first time in over 400 years, people were allowed to visit."
Our visit was on a very hot and humid day which was not helped by the large crowds.All in all our tour guide was excellent which helped to make it a memorable experience
it is very popular with locals so there are ten thousands people there. The security makes it worse. pls go early in the morning to avoid the crowd.
"I'd suggest getting there when it opens in the morning and scoot through as quick as you can. They let 80,000 people in per day and it felt like that as we were caught in a swarm of tourists. Very hot and sweaty and not very pleasant given the crowd."
"First of all: The place is crowded! Really crowded! Upon arriving, we try to find out how to get the tickets. After asking some policemen, we finally found the ticket counter. It was a bit harder for us, because we came in from the East Gate and not from the front gate. But when we walked to the ticket counter, we were happy this way, because the front gate was packed!
Make sure you bring your passport. For some reason, they needed our passports when we bought the ticket.
Anyhow, not going into the history of this place: But it is big. It consists of several layers on the dragon line and each building bears some history and was build for different usage. You have to be very patient because there are queues everywhere. Everyone want to get the best view and people just push themselves to the front. Don't worry too much and stand there. They don't harm anyone but sometimes it's just not pleasant being constantly pushed around.
Plan a lot of time in the Forbidden City as well. With all the crowd and the huge place, we spend around 3 hours there by just walking and looking around."
"I really enjoyed my visit there. Beautifull buildings, excellent view from the hill. It is however one of the top Beijing atraction so the number of visitors is huge, meaning that you may need to be persistent to watch interior of some the buildings. It is pitty that visitors are not allowed to enter the pavilons to really see what is inside."
"You see it on tv, movies and so on. Realistically, if your here in China you have to see it first hand. If you go by train you'll need your passport. Me for £4 I took a bus and metro and saw the real China and its people.

It gets busy, so leave early and stay late. You truly will not regret it"
"The clue is in the title. They 'only' allow 80,000 visitors per day and we had already met people who had tried to get in but couldn't because the tickets were sold out so we ordered ours online beforehand but that in itself created a nightmare.

The signage is so poor that it's impossible to tell where you're supposed to go to collect the pre-paid tickets. We were lucky that we'd had really good advice from a guide beforehand but we still struggled to understand where we were to go and we ended up on a bit of a wild goose chase before finally getting into the place itself.

It's a fabulous place to see but again, so many people that it wasn't really possible to appreciate it. I spent so long fighting my way through the throngs in the unbearable heat that I found it impossible to concentrate on what I was seeing or being able to absorb any of the facts/ details that were written in my guide book. It just became an enormous chore and I was glad to escape at the other end onto the street and into an air-conditioned taxi."
"A must see when in Beijing, tour the entire Forbidden City and climb up the temple hill north of the Forbidden City for the best view of it, too."
We found that there is a lot of walking to be done in China and the forbidden city and the palace certainly did not let our feet down. To see the old buildings and how they have survived many wars was wonderful to see.
"Wounderful place.
Beautiful building and interesting history this place.
Go there I believe that you will like."
This is a special place but is very crowded and very large - so either leave enough time or be selective with what you see. The dragon wall and the Chinese Opera house were my highlights. I managed to visit this along with Tiananmen square and the Temple of Heaven all in one day - but it was very long and tiring (particularly since I walked the whole way). This was the highlight of the day for me.
"Forbidden city is like a legend if you don't know it's history it is better not to visit it,learn more then go there that's how you can see all the human power... it's enormous and loaded with people form all over the mainland china...
I think it's a must! You'll definitly love the experience."
"Beware, obviously this is a tourist trap ever I've ever seen one, but it's one you dont want to miss out on. I was all 'templed-out' before even walking the entire thing. You can see where some of the royalty are buried. Bring a selfie stick to actually take decent pictures. DO COME! Dont get lost if coming with a tour group."
"Well maintained & very clean. Crowded & hot but this is expected in August. Full of history a place for tourists & Chinese. Headphones are available to take you through as you walk. Built in 1420 & looks much younger. Didn't think we would be impressed but we were. Get your walking shoes on, take water & hat/umbrella for shade"
"The Forbidden City is majestic, grand and Crowded! I can handle tight spaces, but when you are seeing children get knocked over from the rush of constant people it feels very confining. Maybe if there was some type of limits put on entrance numbers?"
"You go to Beijing and after the Great Wall, Forbidden City is usually next on the list. A must see but you don't need a full day like most people tell you to. We went with our three young kids and my son bought the audio tour for RMB40 and he led us the way. It's a big place but if you can dodge around the local tours you can probably do it all in half a day.
It gets very very hot and humid so bring plenty of water with you although you can buy once you are inside.
The palace is very beautiful and very grand.
Kids go for free which is a bonus."
"Of course you need to visit the Forbidden City--it's history is impressive, as is much of the architecture and the sheer scope and number of rooms. On the other hand, one palace gives way to the next and pretty soon you can become numb by the vast number of rooms, shrines, etc. So unless you're a Chinese history addict, do yourself a favor and emphasize to your tour guide that you'd like to limit your tour to one hour seeing the building and courtyard highlights, plus some time to visit the interesting if unamazing gardens. We were glad to have seen the Forbidden City, but spending over 3 hours there was a clear overdose."
"I really wanted to see the Forbidden City during my time in China given its historical relevance. Ultimately, I'm glad I went, but understand that this site is really skin deep in terms of content.

We did the China Highlights tour (which was fantastic), so I had a guide at this site. The buildings are really need to look at, and the scale is certainly impressive. (I had read that it seems ""fake"" but didn't find this to be true). That said, its really just the same thing over and over once you're inside, and you really can't go into any of the buildings. Some do have static displays that you can see from outside, but these were the exception.

I would highly recommend hiring a guide of some kind, as he was able to provide a good amount of context about the location/history and point out several things about the buildings themselves that were interesting. Without him there I literally think I would have just wandered around and left without any understanding of what we were looking at. Just a warning, the site is also packed with tourists, almost all of them Chinese. This could be a bit much at certain points if you don't like crowds.

Overall, you pretty much need to see this if you're in Beijing. My time was limited, so I chose this over the Temple of Heaven and Summer Palace. I'm glad I went and don't regret this choice, but its the type of place I probably wouldn't ever go back to."
We spent a few hours wandering round the forbidden city and it was very enjoyable. I think the audio tour was great and the little map with the lights was a great help (although we still got a little lost at one point)
"The forbidden city is a MUST when in Beijing but lots of buildings ans palaces are closed due to ...you don't know why.
In fact, you can only enter TWO places: the old telephoen center and a room, and you can see one of the Emepror's throne from the outside.
Moreover, make sure you go early as they only allow a certain number of tickets to issued each day and when we arrived the first time at 3pm, no tickets were issued anymore."
"The place is a must see atraction. Huge palace, but not a lot to see inside. Only a few buildings/rooms are opened to see. Most of the palace is outside see only"
"Visited in the summer, very bad idea as it was super hot and humid and millions of people pushing and shoving everyone. Found it interesting in its own way, but to crowded therefore could not appreciate it."
"After looting in the boxer rebellion, there are a few prices to see. All are fascinating. Especially the boxes. And the enamel."
You know that was forbidden for long time.you have to visit there.its near Tiananmen square.easy to go by public transportation.
"They just read the signs, so save the cash. Read teh signs. Go early in the morning, it gets hot in July."
"There were lots of locals (which is always the case) who make it a patriotic duty to visit this place in their lifetime. The architecture and history just make you imagine how it was back in those days when the Chinese had their advanced civilization while most of the world were still playing with stones. Unfortunately, many building are off limits (due to unexplained hauntings/sightings of old residents, the government simply blocked them off). I think it would've been more interesting if they reduced the number of visitors daily to really appreciate and digest the atmosphere of this grand place."
"I love history everywhere so i found the Forbidden City to be so amazing..Entry fee was reasonable, best time to go would be early in the morning to avoid all the massive crowds and loud tour groups, great photographs to be taken at the palace, Sunglasses & hat is a must .."
Visited the palace earlier and was overwhelmed by the huge crowd. Rented a automated guide which was very helpful in explaining each part of the palace.
"This historical site helped us understand part of the royal lifestyle of emperors. The contrast between royals and the common people (outside of the Forbidden City) was very interesting. A tour guide is worth hiring to understand the history behind the walls of this humongous place. This attraction can be done on the same day as Tianmen Square. As a follow up go to the Summer Palace (not nearby). Bring your passport, it's required to enter. Water, sunscreen, comfortable shoes and toilet paper are a must."
We expected to see more of the inside of the buildings on our visit. The complex is huge and requires la great deal of walking. Most buildings are closed but your guide will give you insight into the ancient history of this complex. To get a glimpse of ancient China the Forbidden City is a worthwhile visit.
"Of course you're going to miss the Forbidden City. The tour overall can take you between 2-4 hours if you want to look at every single temple and small museum, or simple walk in a straight line observing and looking at the big temples in the middle."
"Organized chaos to sum up the entrance process but completely worth it. Go early in the morning, and don't let the queue to the security checkpoint discourage you. When I say early, 7:30am early. When I walked past the Forbidden City later that day, around noon, there were at least a good 2,000 people waiting to go through. The Forbidden City consists of the main flow of traffic, basically an artery that goes right through the City, so be sure to break away and explore the side palaces and gardens. I've never seen so many people in all my life, but the side palaces and gardens were practically deserted. All in all I spent about an hour and a half exploring and it was truly magical!"
Legendary place. Muts to visit if you are in Beijing. Free entry in some areas. Lots of tourists from China and all over the world. Sorry my bad english.
"I lived in Beijing for two and half year s and of course I got the chance to visit this place back in 2012 after visiting Great Wall of china.
I would say that this is beautiful place to visit from all over the world. It makes their history makes them famous."
Must visit! We were lucky to visit this special place. A true historical site that must be treasured by the world. The history comes to you from every sight.
"We were in two minds as to either tackle this huge complex on our own, or take a guided tour. Answer- if you want the history of the place, you need an experienced guide to explain it as you walk through it, and also handle the tickets and passport control (which was baffling to us as the guide disappeared with them for 20 minutes, keeping us wondering what they were doing to them?)
Was a little difficult following the magic umbrella, especially when it was a red one and there where many red umbrellas that day, so stay close when in the crowd. We started with 37 people and we finished with 37 so our girl did a good job we thought seeing as the crowds were unbelievable for a Saturday.
Seriously cannot say the place was outstanding due to only briefly getting to see inside the various palace buildings, at risk to personal injury from selfie sticks poking me in strange places as we fought for a photo opportunity, so I brought some really great postcards at the end of the quite entertaining tour.
One grizzle, there is near zero spots for a sit down to rest tired legs after 90 minutes. Also only one set of toilets midway through the complex, so easy on the water!"
"I expected this Palace / Forbidden City to be more beautiful, bigger, more 'something special' but it was not.
I mean, it was really nice visiting it but nothing memorable I recall from there. Lama temple, on the other hand, was wow!
Give it a go, It is one of the highlights of Beijing for sure. The price is reasonable : 60 yuans."
"Being one of top 10 world's most visited places, Forbidden City is almost forever crowded, the worsts are during China's national holidays and weekends. Nevertheless, where else can we see the preserved remains of China's history and culture spanning 500 years under 24 emperors, including Puyi the last one (the 1987 Columbia Picture's movie about Puyi was the first approved by the China government to be shot inside the Forbidden City). Can you imagine a place built by over 1 million workers, took 14 years to complete as they had to bring in the best materials from all over the country? Been there twice and were able to see parts in the Inner Court (where the Emperor, Empresses and Concubines lived) which we didn't get to cover the first time around. It's an enormously big complex, 178 acres, 90 palaces with courtyards, 980 buildings and 8,700 rooms that we could easily get lost. So it's better to research and plan ahead, come early, get your best shots and don't get scammed (see the many reviews on China's tourist traps)."
"Stunning! The city is a huge attraction, and will take up a few hours if you take time to explore and walk through it. Choosing a cloudy/pleasant day would make the experience much nicer"
"Being there on a very sunny day in august and the palace is simply amazing. Bring with you the passport as it is mandatory to submit it (or a copy) to the ticket office at the entrance. When you are inside you will be surronded by the Chinese history and by a huge crowd of turists as well. At the exit it is very difficult to get a taxi so, if you are not with a private driver， expect to walk a little around until you will find one available."
"Not a lot to see. You're basically walking (maybe 1-2 miles) from a courtyard, through a breezeway between buildings, through another courtyard, then another breezeway between buildings. Maybe our guide didn't show us everything but I saw very little - other than lots of people milling around."
"We visited the forbidden city on a Monday morning, but the place was anyway crazily croweded. If you are able to ignore this big confusion you can anyway enjoy this huge palace and get lost inside the walls during your visit"
"Huge place,, amazing history worth a visit and have a guide you will learn so much more than just walking about on your own!"
"We had been told to expect big crowds at the Forbidden City, but were completely bowled over by the sheer number of visitors - and I accept that we were part of the problem.

The queues for entry do actually move quite quickly; however, once inside, it is difficult to see the temples, or to stop and take a moment as the crowds are immense. One particular bug bear is the number of selfie-sticks in use. It is clearly a magnificent site and I wish that I had had the patience to stay longer, but it was too crowded for me."
"Nice historical place, but not on a sunny day

Very huge, so many buildings, too much crowd and learning

All is good if the weather supports"
I recommend you get there early todo this tour it gets very crowded and also it's the coolest part of the day very interesting I liked the rock garden toilets facilities good
Great place to visit but leave plenty of time lots of people but still worth while just to imagine how they used to live Not a good time to be a beautiful women
"It is a very big palace. You will take at least 2 hours to tour it. With a guide, you will find out the history of Chinese emperor and his family. It is full of history and colorful decorations."
"Having read the guide books about all the different buildings within the huge complex, we felt it would be as good as the many recommendations and all for 60 yuan.
Having read into it on the internet it said 80,000 visitors only per day and best to pre book online. As we had seen the crowds at the great wall we attempted this in our hotel. Eventually we gave up and got the hotel to do it for us. We gave passport details and were told to collect tickets at the forbidden city.

next day we set off early, lined up to collect our pre purchased tickets to dicover we could easily have bought them on the day. We were then sent to another booth over near the queues on the right where you go in. Everything was in chinese, other than above it said comprehensive service window above two booths. The one to the left was only in chinese. I had the bright idea of my husband join one queue and I join the other. Even then we were pushed past by others. The service centre window is the wrong one! The other one I was in was correct and still two young Chinese men tried to push past. I stood my ground. He spoke in Chinese, clearly saying I was in the wrong place. Ignored him, showed passports and got our 'tickets', a piece of A4 paper with chinese on it!

Well it worked and we got in but along with what felt like 100,000 people. The crowds were horrendous, yes the buildings were amazing but when you've seen one you've pretty much seen them all.
it was hugely disappointing not to see inside any buildings, may be a couple you could peer in but it was such a scrum that we gave up and tried to avoid the heat and people. The ticket price should be reduced for so many closures and it should tell you in English what is open.
yes you feel you must go there but in the heat and crowds of August with little respite from any of it indoors you should be prepared! We were out within a couple of hours and a lot of that was spent sitting in the shade, trying to figure out why it was all shut! Or in the cafe having a cold drink.
Instead go to the top of the pavilion hill at the park near the north gate and look down on it. Sooo much more peaceful and relaxing."
"We visited the Forbidden City on our SNA tour. WoW!! We are used to summer heat living in WA but add 110,000 people and humidity it was 45 c - hot! Our tour was very organized and we were able to view the internal section of the palace. It is a long, hard walk but well worth it. Extremely large structure. Plenty of walking, so wear comfortable shoes and clothing. In the peak summer months July, August, wear a hat, take sunscreen and water. The floor becomes incredibly hot and air becomes thin due to large crowds. However, the history adds to the excitement with extensive grounds with
ample space to spread out once you enter inner city gates. We finally made our way to the Imperial Garden. Along the way lovely Ancient Trees and Chinese Wisteria. Pretty impressive considering it's age, architecture and history brilliant. Loved it all!"
This is China's Disneyland.............you can literally stay here all day........it is huge !! The building have been preserved and take you back to a time in history that not many people know of. We really enjoyed this place took many pictures.
"Thank goodness we booked a tour with Urban Adventure - Beijing Insights. Be prepared for lots of walking, crowd and in the heat! Forbidden City is HUGE! and again MAJESTIC!

Some parts you get to see the restored vs the one not restored, simply amazing."
"Our tour began at Tiananmen Square and continued immediately into the Forbidden City and Palace. We were on our feet for 4 hours with no time given to sit down, in intense heat. The palace and city are awesome with beautiful well kept buildings. The space in the City is so huge that even with the crowds you can manage and don't feel stuck in anywhere except when you try to see inside the buildings. Tip - get your photo and get out."
"Beautiful, well preserved Forbidden City! It's huge so wear comfy shoes. It gets really packed though do if you're traveling with people, someone should go buy tickets and everyone else should go get in line. The toilets aren't the best so make sure you take care of your needs before you go there."
"Took 2-3 hrs to see this museum as the best time spent in Beijing. Do not forget to see the clock Hall as well. Have to buy another ticket (RMB10) inside the forbidden city, a perfect old collections of clocks from all over the world gathered by Chinese emperors as a gift"
"Yes this is also the historical place! Nice but lot's of gathering, crowd y place! We could not enjoyed a lot there.."
"During my visit to Beijing, one of my friend advice to visit the Forbidden City, I was reluctant to go, but on his insisting when i go their, i was shocked, why i was not coming here, this is one of the largest city of the Chinese Emperors, her i saw the tradition of these big people, and impressed."
"All of the buildings are closed during the summer months ""for security reasons."" The only part that wasn't so heavily restored that it looked like a complete reconstruction was the harem, and you could look through windows into the buildings there. The garden was also beautiful."
"Really beautiful, very crowded (all China is crowded but this place is even more crowded), and definitely better to visit with a guide that can explain the history and the many artifacts."
I think everyone that visits Beijing will come here anyway. It is not bad but it's just nothing special. Great example of Chinese architecture if you are a fan.
"Came in at 9h, it was absolutely packed. Crazy packed. The place is amazing, but expect to be overwhelmed with crowds everywhere, much like the other places around here."
"The Forbidden City is HUGE; it is majestic, and if you are planning a trip, be ready to spend at least a half day within the walls.

Tip: Pack light, but pack lots of snacks. There are food and drink stalls inside the compound, but they mainly sell the same snacks you find at any other tourist attraction in Beijing. Plenty of water being sold on-site too, and after a whole day under the sun, you would want some ice cold liquid down your throat too (ask for 'bing sui' - cold water).

We opted to get the audio guide, recommended by some travellers we met the day before. It is a comprehensive audio guide, though at some points it can take awhile to pick up a signal.

Some halls were closed when we were there, which was a shame.
Growing up, I would watch TVB series on imperial China. Hence being in the compound, I get images of the Emperor sitting on his throne or concubines relaxing on the courtyard (or discussing ways to get rid of an Emperor's new favourite) - ahh..

Some of the main halls in the central axis were closed off too. Some with only the front door open wide enough for crowd to see through and view whatever's in there. However, be prepared to witness hoards of local tourists pushing their way to get a glimpse of whatever is exhibited in those halls, 90% of the with the cameras/phones on selfie sticks snapping away, and pushing you to the side before you can even get a proper look of the details in the room as explained on the audio guide. Kind of a turn-off. I guess that is part-and-parcel of the whole experience.

Plenty of resting areas/seats around the compound, some areas with wifi too."
"Starting at Tianamen square, a tour of the forbidden city is a must when in Beijing, the museums and gardens are worth a day or two"
"I visited in early July, when it was already hot and humid. While it would be better to visit in May or early June, it is still possible to have a good visit in July if you take it easy and drink plenty of water, which is readily available for purchase."
"Our Odyssey tour guide, Mr. Ben
gave us a brilliant tour of the forbidden
city and the palace treasures. He was
so knowledgeable that he was able to
translate the ancient Chinese letter that
were placed on the walls. He gave very
clear histories and stories of the emperors
and the dynasties. We were very
impressed with Mr. Ben and learned
a lot from him."
"The Forbidden City is fantastic. It's a huge expanse of buildings, alleyways and gardens. It will take about 2-3 hours to see at a good pace but you could easily spend half a day there.

Go as early as possible in the morning as it was so busy! Lots to look at and some great photo ops to be had - especially with the locals!"
"Of course this is a must when visiting Beijing. Come early as the crowds in August get very intense. ( I really mean intense). The ticket sale opens at 8.30am and closes at 3.30pm. I missed it one day as I got there at 3.30 and wanted to avoid the dreaded crowds but all was closed up. So I got there the next morning at 8.30 and had no problem getting tickets and touring with a relative decent crowd. Later than that and you are with thousands of people. Plus the summer heat gets to you so you want to out as early as you can. Forbidden city is lovely and fun to explore. You can't enter any of the buildings, you mostly visit the outside and peek into some open doors to see the inside. Beware that you are standing with lots of people at a small door and selfie sticks that are all around you! I had to battle many umbrellas and selfie sticks that I gave up after a while. This is where your early morning beat-the crowds comes in. I can't imagine how that would be at peak time.
Take your time wandering around. I ended by going up to the temple at the end that gives you a city view, a lovely good Buddha and great views of the whole forbidden city. The entrance is extra but worth it. It's also not as crowded."
"If you really want to see the place you really really need time, either you study about the place before you visit, at least read something on the net, will be very help full, get the GPS guide which you can hire at the gate, Its massive, unbelievable and a must see in your life"
Awesome place where we can discover a part of china history and see all the amazing details on their constructions
Steeped in history and a thoroughly enjoyable outing when in Beijing. My wife and I hired a tour guide who was extremely helpful in giving us a history of this previously non accessible area for the likes of me and you. Very interesting to see how the emperors of China lived in an almost secret world.
"It is indeed the must-see place of Beijing. I won't be exaggerating if I say China. I've been there few times and it got more crowded every time. And the rooms are now fenced and you're only allowed to peek through the fence. Very sad! But the palace itself is fascinating. Pay attention to the details of roofs, and columns."
"A great visit! We came with a privately booked tour guide and it was a really interesting place to walk around, although it is huge there is so much to see. Travelling with a family of teenagers meant Chinese tourists were constantly taking photos of us which we loved albeit a little surreal but were happy to get involved in and pose with them."
"Very beautiful place but always very crowded. As usual in China the crowds are very well organised, though. Went there on a Sunday at peak season early in the morning and yet didn't have to wait in line for a single second. Inside it was still crowded though but it's OK. Will be a challenge though to take a picture without a bunch of strangers in it.
Don't underestimate the amount of walking that has to be done."
"The Forbidden City in the heart of Beijing is the largest and most complete imperial palace and ancient world-building complex. Twenty-four rulers from the Ming and Qing, 1644 to1911 dynasties resided and administrated China from the City. The Forbidden City, which extends 753 meters from east to west, and 961 meters from north to south, consists of several dozen compounds of varying sizes and some 9,000 rooms. Most of the buildings were constructed with wood, roofed with yellow glazed tiles and built on blue-and-white stone foundations, typical of Imperial China. They are simply brilliant. Imagine the City walls were 10 meters high!
So why should you come and see this place? Because there is none like this one around the world, trust me! The buildings of the Forbidden City fully embody the artistic features and style of ancient Chinese palace architecture. You can visit the Gate of Heavenly Purity, the Palace of Heavenly Purity, the Hall of Union, the Palace of Earthly Tranquility, the Imperial Palace Flower Garden, Hall of Imperial Palace, Palace of Eternal Harmony, Palace of Abstinence, the Nine Dragon Screen, the Imperial Zenith Hall, the Palace of Peaceful Longevity, Hall of Mental Cultivation, the Arrow Tower and the Gated of Divine Prowess – Wow!
Every room is full of unique traits, usages, and historical facts. For example, in The Palace of Heavenly Purity legend says Chong Zhen drunk killed his 15-year-old daughter and concubine! And in the Palace of Abstinence the emperor fasted before making sacrifices? Two items took me back, to think. One was the Golden Water, a group of five marbles bridges symbolizes the five cardinals virtues of Confucianism. And the Roof Guardians, which are like little dragon’s figurines associated with water and suppose to protect the buildings from fire. You would need to look up to see them.
To enter the Forbidden City you would need to use the Meridian Gate, South end of the complex. Know that you are using the gate that the king used. There is a cost of approximate $10.00 dollars to enter and there is audio guide at an extra cost. The place opens from 8:30 to 4:30 or 5:00 depending on the time of the year. And like most places there are also tour guides ready to help you for a cost of course.
Take your time walking the grounds of this amazing complex…at one point the king spoke to over 100,000 people at one time…tried to imagine that as you take in this most stunning piece of olden designs…watch the hills at the distant, if they could only speak!
As always, stay safe!"
You cannot visit Beijing and miss the Forbidden City. You'll need to take a tour because there's just soooo much to see and learn. Wear your walking shoes and get ready to immerse yourself in a time capsule of Chinese history!
"A UNESCO World heritage site, this place is massive. Give at least 2 hours to see once you are in. 1st step is a security line, which moves quickly. 2nd step enter thru the Meridian gate until you find the ticket. counter. If you go in the afternoon, you may want to reserve your tickets, they only allow 80,000 in per day. Mornings are fine, you will get in. The palace itself is spectacular. Very ornate and well preserved. One of fhe highlights of our trip."
"A trip to Tiananmen Square would be incomplete without a visit to the Forbidden City. During the time of emperors, only royals or high ranking officials were permitted to enter the city where the emperor lived. Fortunately, we are able to visit and admire this architectural marvel today and gape at its expanse and intricacy."
"We were there just around 08-30 on a Monday morning and it was busy then, get a guide to show you round, so much of interest, 2nd time we have been in 6 years and still missed things"
"I'm really into history but I do not think it was worth the money we spent. Don't get me wrong, it was a beautiful place but for the most part it was very repetitive."
"I really liked this place considering there was a lot to do. They had gardens, temples, palaces, armies, and so much more."
Somehow the Forbidden City has a great reputation as number 1 thing to see in Beijing. And yes it is huge and impressive and the buildings look great and you feel the history... BUt after a while they all look the same and we were actually skipping some of them not expecting anything new. Maybe if you have a tour guide then it is better but we did not have time to hire one. Also the place is very crowded with Chinese tourists and you can only enter from one side and exit on the other side (While we actually needed it to be the opposite to fit with our walking itinerary). It is nice place to see but nothing overly exciting really...
"Wow, get there early in the morning!
This place is very very busy, it's interesting you need a guide to ensure you get the maximum impact."
"Over 600 years of history, the palace of Ming and Qing dynasty is truly amazing. Truly a 7 wonder of the world!"
"Or one if you hate crowds. But that wouldn't be fare for a must visit site like this. Don't let the endless stream of people getting in from Tianmen square mislead you. Go with the flow, don't mis the ticket counters on your left!! otherwise you will have to go back at the entrance.
Waited max 15 minutes at ticket counter and again 15 to get in the Palace (where it looked as it would take me hours...).

Choose to stay the whole day and dwell along all accessible places (beware, despite the sacred 9.999 rooms the Palace is more an outside venue with Some rooms to enter) and deepen every inch of history up to the last emperor. Or walk with the crowd and enjoy the greatness of the place for 1,5-2 hours max. Both OK I guess!

Tips for the short stay: when you enter, walk to the right to see a little more diverse parts of the complex, then return to the central route which is self explanatory with the emperor gardens at the end.

Get out on the north and walk into Jinshan Park (2 yuan entrance). Dont let the tuck tuck riksja drivers fool you (some indicate to bring you up the hill), just walk across the street pay the 2yuan and very easily walk up the hill to have a magnificent view on the forbidden city you just walked through)"
We went to this place after visiting the Palace so we did not like it much except some stones here and there. If you are not with a guide it is difficult to understand the importance of each. Hawkers/ e-rickshaw guys and painting sellers make your walking difficult in the area.
"Called the ""palace museum,"" the forbidden city was much larger and grander than I expected.

I went with a private tour so they had pre purchased my tickets (a great time saver, and only a limited number of tickets are sold each day)

It was very crowded but the site is large enough that you can spread out.

Many wonderful buildings, courtyards. If you have time there are a number of indoor areas you can view

There is very little shade--bring your own water.

There is security but I found it polite and efficient

It will be a much more meaningful visit if you see with a tour guide. At the very least read up on the history/significance before visiting (no explanations on site in English)"
"A very historical place for chinese people. Always full of people, bring your own food/snacks because there's limited shop inside.
If you bring kids, you should try to explain/give some information about this site first, so they'll share the same enthusiasm as you while navigating this huge ""city""."
We were really looking forward to visiting the Forbidden City but the experience was spoilt by huge crowds who pushed and shoved the whole time. We went early in the morning but that didn't seem to make any difference. I am glad I've been but didn't see as much as I hoped to due to the crowds.
"on leaving the Tianenmen square and walking through the peoples gate we spent time at the Massive Forbidden city. Part of our taste of china tour we had a great tour guide who told us all sorts of interesting facts about its history and structure.
The venue was quite crowded but as its so big it isn't really an issue, apart from if you want to take a look to were the original emperors throne sat (check my pictures) you need to fight your way in for a photo while avoiding a smack in the face by a couple of selfie sticks on the way lol. You can also visit smaller courtyards within the city where concubines and the such were housed.
The forbidden city is one majestic piece of china and must not be missed"
"We went early and did not have to queue. If you are a senior there is a 50% discount if you have ID. Our passports were back at the hotel, but I did have my Australian driver's licence so I got the discount.
The ceramics are beautifully set out from Neolithic to the last dynasties. Some truly beautiful specimens and lots of info in English. The sheer size of the Forbidden City is extraordinary. It is certainly on a breathtaking scale and certainly demonstrates the power of the emperors. The 3 major halls you have to fight people to look in the windows to see the thrones which are impressive. It is worth the battle. It is such a large site it is easy to get lost. The exit is not easy to find and takes you out near the Haidian District which is very interesting but you are too tired to do anything more by then."
"I went here during National Holiday Week in China so all the locals have it off. This place is huge and very crowded in the beginning. There are a ton of stairs because every hall you go to , you have to go up stairs. At the very beginning there is a lot of pushing and shoving (their culture) when you want to take pictures and if you are not getting pushed or shoved you get hit with a selfie stick. I don't think it is that bad at normal times. All that said, I really enjoyed my visit. once you pass the first halls, people tend to scatter out to the sides and it is much easier. This place is huge so wear comfortable shoes GETTING IN TO THE palace, there is a security check and you must scan your bags and go through a metal detector. if you are a smoker be prepared to have your lighter and matches taken away. When you get to the end of the Palace Museum you can cross the street to go to Jingshan Park.. not to be missed."
"As interesting as the museum contents are, the signs for the public as just as interesting. Fascinating place, every bit of it."
"Guides offer historical significance of the many rooms.
Family friendly but can get a little overcrowded"
"Go to the Forbidden City. This place is just unforgettable. Try to avoid busy days to be able to enjoy the atmosphere without the usual crowds. In spite of the huge queues, everything flows fast and smooth."
Very very crowded but well worth a visit.The forbidden city is amazing but so vast it would take days to see it all.The carving and colours are quite spectacular.Lots of walking involved.
We could have spent hours here and our three hours were not enough; we were on a guided tour as part of a Viking Cruise. We went early in the morning but already the crowds were fairly large. However the complex is so huge that it is relatively easy to fund a little time and space for yourself. Would definitely visit again. The Imperial Garden at the end of the visit was lovely.
"The capital of Ming & Qing dynasties, the palace grounds are huge. With the many palaces & maze-like corridors one can easily get lost on the premises if without a map or guide.

Some points to share:
*You can combine an evening visit to Tiananmen square with a morning visit to the Palace Museum as they're within close proximity.
*Try to visit in the morning, as there's a limit to the number of visitors allowed per day & also due to the huge grounds you may need more time to tour.
*Foreigners usually mistaken the palace as Mao's mausoleum after seeing his portrait hanging on the palace walls outside. It is not the case."
"We were here with family, literally walked for almost two hours. It was crowded, there were a lot of visitors. There were many palaces inside, a museum and houses. I was amazed how they built it. Really worth the walk."
"A must on the list. We had a tour guide who explained us everything. Wonderful place. Alot of walk , alot to explore."
"So much history so much to see. A lot of walking. If you are in Beijing you have to visit. Beautiful architecture. You can walk where you want , we had a guide with us that was very helpful."
"This place is huge. I have been here 3 times and still haven't walked through the whole place yet. Get the guides as they r very helpful. Remember to bring ur student card and ID with you when u r buying tickets, much cheaper. 买票记得带身份证和学生证，没身份证买不了票，学生票便宜很多，记住记住记住"
"It`s a very interesting experience. Be prepared to walk a lot. At the end of the tour, you can see the Forbidden City from the top of the hill (must pay 10 yuan, but it`s worth it)."
"We visited the Forbidden City along with Tiananmen Square. The palace grounds are lovely. The cobblestones on the path might be tough for those who have trouble walking, so be warned. I like that visitors can only walk from the front to the back of the palace. The crew seems to be always working to upkeep the palace. You aren't allowed to go inside any areas, so don't expect to be able to tours rooms. However, it's still worth the visit to view the lovely place grounds and the garden behind the living area."
"Followed advice, only entry by the main Meridian (south) gate, keep walking past all the ticket outlets until you get to the very last one. ¥60 entry ¥40 for the audio guide (didn't rate the audio guide much as it uses slightly different names than on the map so was a little confusing) Found a very lovely quite garden on the far west side (not on the map) rather than the very busy imperial garden. Completely stunning, spent 5 hours wandering around."
"It is best to visit in the middle of the week. Never on a Saturday or Sunday. The volume of visitors on weekends is overwhelming. I am a seasoned traveler who has visited many sights around China over the last 20 years. It is best to read before you visit and go to say you went. It is central to so much history. If possible you should go to Tienanmen Plaza for the changing of the guard ceremony at the flag. After your visit, continue left out hte exit and up the road for a short distance until you reach the park along the lake. walks along the water are very relaxing and lined with small restaurants and cafe for snacking."
"We spent a large part of the day here. A lot to look at, very interesting and a must visit.
If you have mobility problems it could be difficult"
"Really impressive, though the buildings tend to be repetitive in terms of style. I definitely recommend at least 4 to 5 hours. I did it in 3 hours and i had to run. The place is so huge."
"It doesn't matter when you come, early in the morning or late noon, it would always be crowded with desperate and rude Chinese.
Get ready to walk, and don't forget an umbrella, in case it rains or it's sunny, and lots of water and food.
For discount show student ID (60¥->20¥)
If you feel lost, just follow the crowd."
"I visited recently with friends. Having lived in Beijing for almost a year, I had seen the Forbidden City from the outside, but never inside.

We went in June and arrived via the metro station at Tiananmen Square. When you first enter and start to wander around, you look at the place in awe - as it is so massive the scale of the place is truly impressive. There are lots of great photo opportunities throughout the palace. However, as you proceed through the Palace, you sort of get the impression that you are seeing more.... and more... and more of the same.

I would recommend a visit to anyone - but I would say that as you move on and start to feel that you aren't really seeing anything new, it is because the architecture and set-up of many of the buildings are the same... So don't feel you have to see everything. You could easily spend 4+ hrs here, but If you spend 2-3.. you have basically seen enough.

Did I enjoy it - Yes
Would I go again - Maybe - before I leave China
Would I recommend the place to friends - Yes"
"Not what I expected, but still pretty nice. A must visit in Beijing. Extremely crowded, which can be a bit annoying.. Restrooms awful."
"Definetly is a place that if you are in China you must go. It is giant and impressive for the power it shows.
The only problem is that it is crowded of people any place. So it becomes difficult to see and understand the different buildings."
"On a very rainy Beijing day, a small group of us visited Tiananmen Square and The Forbidden City. The July rain was a bit of an irritant-- it's not like the rain I'm used to living in the PNW, there was no way to not be soaked to the skin-- in fact, I'd suggest adding the humidity, the moisture is as bad from the inside out. However. given the week of 35C°+ temps, the rainy day was a relief from the unrelenting heat. It's impossible to put into the words the experience of walking through 3 massive stone ""gates""-- they are called gates, but that is too small a word-- 3 stories tall, wider still, with a massive tunnel through the centre. The walk from the first gate the the third (where you purchase your ticket for the Palace Museum-- FYI Palace Museum and Forbidden City are one and the same) is about a 10 minute walk. The thing that is impossible to get one's head around is the sheer size and scale of the construction. The name ""City"" is not a misnomer-- you can imagine hundreds of people living within the walls. An hour of walking and we didn't come close to seeing it all. If I ever get the chance to go again, I'll go in the cooler season, bring a lunch and stay all day.
Advice: Admission is reasonable-- about $10CAD-- but you need to produce some sort of ID. My Driver's licence was enough."
The Forbidden City is usually part of an organized stop on tours. It is truly a place to behold and used in several monumental films - The Last Emperor for example. It is as large and impressive as imagined. The visit brings history right to you as you can feel its ageless existence.
"This is a great spectacle and is the jewel in Beijing that is a must to see.
Start in Tiananmen Square and wander to see the monuments and take take up the history of this vast space.
Move towards the Forbidden City and view the giant flag, guards and picture of Mao before moving onto the main entrance.
The history starts at the entrance beginning with the three gates and unless you have read all there is to know I would suggest you hire a personal guide for at least two hours to provide a commentary.
Every aspect is fascinating, spend time in the concubine area and then move on to the gardens and out through the north gate to complete a memorable visit."
"For those who watches Qing dynasty Chinese drama, you should never miss this place. It is amazing to see this great palace where full of eunuch and concubines Long Long time ago. Their 3 stories ""cinema"" is quite an interesting concept"
"A lovely place spoilt by the sheer number of tourists. Can;t be helped I suppose, we all want to see the palace museum and wander around.
If you can plan it enter at the front and walk through to the back, exit and view from the back, wandering to the front down the side. Its impressive from the outside too."
"I won't elaborate on the place: it's a wonderful cultural and historical treasure. But gone are the days when you had it all for yourself. Now you have to deal with the crowds and the constraints that go with it.

When I last visited it 15 years ago, it was practically empty, only a few foreigners wandered around. Now? Very, very different as the Chinese have embraced tourism.

First you have to get there. The best way is the subway, for cars are not allowed to stop anywhere near the place. Or be prepared to walk 20 minutes just to cross TianAnMen and get to the entrance.

TianAnMen East station is the nearest and you just have to follow the flow of people to take you to the checkpoint. Count half an hour from the subway to the actual gates after you bought your ticket.

First you have to queue for the securty checkpoint, which is a mere formality. The security gates beeped for me but I was told to just go on.

After you cross the first two gates, time to buy the tickets. Most of the Chinese have a sort of sheep mentality and just follow the persons on front of them and clog the first counters. Take that to your advantage and walk to the empty counters a bit further. Ten minutes saved.

Bring your own water! You can buy some and the entrance, but with the usual scam: a price for the locals a higher price for Chinese tourists and a even higher price for us foreigners.

It takes between 2 and 3 hours to complete the visit. In the hot Beijing summer, it's unbearable without properly hydrating. If you are bringing young kids along, don't forget to protect them from the sun and pack some snacks.

The palace is always overcrowded. Prefer the morning hours when it's not too hot and when there are relatively less people.

You're in China, so you know how to work the crowd here. People stop in the most incongruous places: they like to stop at every threshold and block everyone else. You'll be pushed and elbowed and people are going to overtake you for absolutely no reason. But that's just how it goes here. Even they push you aside, it's not rude for them and they might even try to start a friendly conversation while they do it (I have twin girls that attract a lot of attention).

So be patient and enjoy the moment. You are in one of the finest palaces in the world, don't let the public spoil it for you.

The visit is a strict one way, from the south entrance to the north exit. You can't turn around.

So after a few hours, you'll end up north, after the last gate, on your own.Because there is absolutely nothing there: you are in the middle of nowhere without a subway station in sight.

There are a few buses, but they are obviously crowded. You know that hailing a taxi is a nightmare, And if you don't speak Chinese and have a Chinese SIM card, Didi Dache and Uber are off limit.

You have been warned of rickshaw scam so you avoid them at any cost.

But anyway you are hungry and would gladly eat a bit. Surprisingly, there are no shops, no restaurants, nothing.

Your only option is to walk a bit. When going south back to TianAnMen, you'll find those tiny three wheel cars. Negotiate the price before hand and they'll take you somewhere near civilization.

We decided to find a restaurant before that and walked toward WangFuJing before finding a very decent restaurant after a 30 minute walk."
"It’s amazing to visit these historical buildings and learn how the emperors lived, many people and very hot in the summer. I really recommend this place."
"Been watching the place for many cheese historical movies and drama.

The palace is majestic and huge !!! July is 35 degree calculus and school summer holiday .... It's about 50,000 visitors during my visit.

Nothing much attracting me actually , because everywhere was crowded and I can only see the outlook of the palace and not allowed to enter the palace ... It's a museum full of building.

I was so tired and nap for 20 min at the chairs provided for public and no one disturbed me !!! I slept at the palace ... Lol !!!"
"To enter in the forbidden city you wll need:
- Money. You have to pay everywhere you go.
- Your passport. No passport, no entrance.
- Be there before 15:00 (depending on the season).

What you do not need:
- You do not need to enter from the Tiananmen, the qeue is inbelievable. There is a ""free entrance"" from the east. Then you will have to pay the tickets."
It is quite big and hot if you are there in summer months- take hat and umbrella! Worth seeing this historical place--make sure to visit the park that oversees the City- Jingshan Park
It is an extremely interesting place to visit but is incredibly overcrowded and we struggled to view the entire place as it was just too busy to enjoy the experience. I would recommend visiting as it is a traditional lovely museum but maybe stick to weekdays or early mornings when it is less busy.
Rich in history and culture. Amazing architecturally and history. I recommend a tour group to help understand the actual history no one speaks English!
"It is the Forbidden City. What else is there to say except, cool. It is always a thrill to walk in an historic area, and the FC does not disappoint. Keep in mind that everything in China is crowded. Be prepared for many, many people visiting, too. Finally, if you have problems with walking up and down stairs - this is not the place for you."
This was a ver interesting place to visit. it was just one place we visited during our 5 day stay in beijing.
"This grandiose palace was never accessible to the ordinary citizens during the olden times (thus ""forbidden""). But now that it is open to the public even locals visit this place if only to see their historical nobility. Weekends will find yourself in crowds. Choose a weekday when the locals are still at work."
"After Great wall, The palace museum is the second most popular attraction of China, it is over and over crowded specially in week ends and public holidays, it is better not to plan on those days whereas you may visit conveniently on week days from Monday to Friday. There a lots of attractions inside and outside the palace museum. There is entrance ticket and inside you can find food items and gift shops as well."
"Great cultural experience, unfortunately I have been there for few hours due to my flight connection. I suggest to visit this site with a local tour guide as you can get the most from walking around this place."
"Tickets for the palace are usually sold out by noon.

Get there soon before they are all sold. The ticket office is near de musem."
"I didn’t research much about Forbidden City before the visit as we had a guide along with us, just knew the name Forbidden City-The Palace Museum & was expecting some great antiques from Imperial China; I was in for a disappointment.

Forbidden City is the Imperial Palace Grounds of the Chinese Emperor, basically all the royalty stayed here and the government was run from in there. The city is a UNESC World Heritage Site touted to have the largest collection of preserved ancient wooden structure in the world. What it means is a vast collection of wooden buildings which look pretty much the same. The city got close to 9000 rooms in about 900 buildings, most with their own walls and courtyard. 90% of the city is still closed to public so as to preserve the structures. The sections which are open are the best and the biggest ones but one can’t enter them, just see from outside. Frankly there is nothing much to see in the empty chambers & halls, most of the artifice are in other museums. There are thrones in different halls but they didn’t seem special, although the ceiling work was exceptional. Worse part was the hordes of other tourist, one need to fight them to get space for a peek into the halls. Also keep in mind almost all the buildings and courtyard have been restored, takes away the ancient feel from them.

Forbidden City is all about its crazy size and it is vast at 180 acres. The other thing which stood out for me was the Imperial Garden with its impressive Rock Landscaping. Would recommend people to skip Forbidden City and instead observe it from Jingshan Park. For seeing Chinese architecture one can go to the less crowded and more tranquil Lama Temple."
"Get there early to avoid the crowds (or rather the huge crowds) and to avoid disappointment as they have a limit of 80k visitors a day.

60rmb to get in and an extra 10 for the hall of clocks and treasure hall.

Will take you a good few hours so give yourself at least half a day and take plenty of water."
"Yes you are on the palace of the emperor and all his power.. you will be walking on his steps and see his huge city that was once forbidden.
The palace is huge and each section is designed to serve a specific purpose..
If you are going by your own try to read about this palace before you go there so you can link the beauty to history."
"This place is huge and amazing. It forbid a lot of history. It's a place to visit when you have time cause you have to look the details and take a lots of pictures. Don't go on Monday, because it's closed. I also advise you to go on a sunny days or at least cloudy days. It is a long walk..."
"80,000 people tourists visit each day, but the system works very well. Security is tight and passports needed. Everyone walks in one direction which means the people keep moving. Interesting visit, water on sale inside and toilets available."
"Way to crowded, is a lot of walking, loads of stairs, won't recommend stroller in a hot day will be terrible to find shade, the place is very beautiful but being so crowded it puts it down."
"The best way to get there is by train, just follow the crowds since there will be a boat load of them all going to one place. You will have to stay in line for like 10mins and hope the humidity is not 100% like it was for me. It cost 60RMB to get in and you will find that it is amazing. It will be crowded and for the most part you will have to walk a ton to go from one end to the other. I would suggest you get the audio guide, since it would have been handy to have while visiting.

The Treasure room is on the right side which cost 20RMB to get in and is worth it since it is less crowded and there is a spot that has AC!!! It will defiantly make you want to go there when it is freaking hot outside.

Buy lots of water since you really will need it out here."
"well worth a visit, huge place, you get a feel of the luxury they lived in with their concubines, lovely building and gardens"
"Interesting to see culture, architecture and to get an understanding of past centuries of chinese history!"
"The Forbidden City is thankfully not so Forbidden and you're able to go in and have a look around. There are lots of rooms opened up that you can look into and see how things used to be, and the buildings themselves are amazing.

The courtyards can be uneven so watch your footing, but it's an amazing place to visit and i'd highly recommend it if you get the chance. The day i went was rather smoggy so it did take away from the effect, though i daresay if it was a clear day it would be even more remarkable."
"The Forbidden City is gigantic. Mostly ancient historical buildings that you get to walk near and peer into. The Chinese people were not allowed into the area for so long, and you can tell that it is a popular tourist site like visiting Washington DC. Our tour guide really brought this history to life for us. He recommended watching the movie The Last Emperor to help understand how important this area was."
"During my visit, there was almost nothing to see.
I'm not sure why I say that but my friend who has visited here before said all the ""showrooms "" were shut. Under renovation.
But if you do plan to visit, it would be a god idea to pre purchase your ticket online in advance to skip the queue. You would need an identification to purchase your ticket either online or physical.
I thought my visit was time wasted. But at least I can tell people I have visited the forbidden city in Beijing.."
"The Forbidden City is an important historical place to see in Beijing. Its important to have a good guide who can give you all the history of the place, as I had one."
"A must do with a guide. Without it the buildings are just buildings.

Chinese don't seem to like to queue or respect personal space so don't be polite and hang back and expect to queue when looking into the the windows and doors.

Amazing to think that this was one guys place!!!"
"The Forbidden City has 1700 rooms. Luckily for today's visitors only the main rooms are open to the public. The architecture is superb. The size of the whole logs used as interior support beams are equally impressive, especially when you take note there are no such trees remaining in Bejing. The hand carved marble center walkways were used exclusively by the emperor which may explain why they remain so exquisitely carved. The artifacts on display are of the same breathtaking splendor as the palace itself. Comfortable walking shoes are a must for all members in your group. Buy the tourist guide book in your native language for a more informative experience. Bring fresh drinking water because there are drinking fountains. The rooms are not heated or cooled so dress appropriately for the outside weather. This historical monument is worthy of more than one visit. I would recommend joining a travel group that would include lodging, travel, and at least 3 major attractions such as The Forbidden City, The Summer Palace, and a small bit of the Great Wall."
"This is the area where the 24 emperors of the Ming and Qing dynasties lived. This was the most beautiful area i feel i visited in all of China. The cleanliness of the area was amazing and the architecture was mind blowing. Definitely a must do in Beijing. There is a temple you can walk up to. It is not too much of a climb and the tickets were just 2rmb, you have to go up there because the view of the Forbidden city from there is mind blowing. This was the first place in China we saw yellow roofs, which can only be kept by the emperor. A definite must do on your list of things in Shanghai."
"This was the highlight of our trip to Beijing. The size of the complex was the most surprising. It took a few hours and a lot of walking, but was well worth it. Bring water to drink."
"That's definitely a historical highlight of Beijing. As a consequence, it's crowded and the lines can be very long. I haven't imagined how monumental the site was! But it's a nice discovery: the architecture, the buildings, the gardens. By blue sky weather, it is a great visit."
"Two big advices on this one - avoid holidays and if you can't, seriously, get a guide. The queues were ridiculous when we went, but that was a holiday on a Sunday. We managed to skip the whole queue, security, etc. as we had a guide. It will also provide a lot of information and history, our guide spoke English perfectly (better than the guys in the hotel)."
We came yesterday with a guide so we didn't need to line up or bring passports. There were crowds as its summer holidays. Many of the museums are closed due to crowds which seems a bit ridiculous. Be prepared for lots of walking and bring water. The sheer size is amazing. Make sure to see the smaller palaces to the side and the treasury section
This place. Is massive. How humans have created it is beyond me. It is a sight to behold and it takes forever to walk around. But it is so worth it. You learn so much about Chinese culture during this time period
"When the capacity of 80 000 visitors is reached, the ticket offices close! So at 14h in the afternoon, no tickets were left... And nobody tells you that at the entrance at Tian Man side... And you are not allowed to go back... So you have to follow the stream and have to leave after the second gate without visiting the palace 😡"
Fascinating tour my colleague acted as my guide half price for over 60! I did not realise the massive scale until I entered it was inspirational architecture.
"This should be one of the places to visit if you have time whilst in Beijing.
Prepare yourself for a lot of walking. This is not just o e palace, but a series of palaces all built after each other as one Emperor replaced the last.
You can view the palaces from outside and look into some of them (a real scramble as everyone is jostling for a good position to take a photo). Unfortunately they stopped you walking inside many of the palaces about a few years ago, I believe.
There are a number of museums you can look at and some buildings such as the Emporers Theatre and collections.
Lots of visitors so be prepared for crowds. You can buy cold drinks and ice cream, but don't expect a cafe or restaurant."
"The lines were long long long and they cut off ticket sakes at 4pm so we could not get in wasted a great deal of time getting there.
There is much misinformation on the net about how much time"
"This place is dripping with history. You are walking on 800 year old bricks and seeing the icon of Chinese culture. Read about this place before you go so you can imagine what life was like so long ago up through the last Emperor who died in the 1970's.

Notes....
Be ready to walk. It is about 1km from the entrance to exit in a straight line (but you cannot just walk in a straight line)

Be ready for crowds. Thousands of people go through every day it is open. You need a ticket because there are a limited number of visitors allowed every day. Tour guides will know what to do to get them or go to the website.

Go when it is open. Most of the year it is closed on Mondays. July-August excepted and major holidays

It can get quite warm in the summer so bring water.

Get ready to take a lot of pictures and keep your camera spare battery ready.

You can only proceed toward and exit at the opposite end from where you enter.

It isn't particularly handicap friendly.

A trip to Beijing needs to include some time here. Plan for an hour or two , or for history buffs - 3-5."
"I can't rave enough about this place. It's scale is amazing and the only way to understand it is to go. Please plan accordingly when going though, we went July and I think a weekend and the place was mobbed with more people than I've ever seen, I swear even more than Disney!

We spent a few hours and still haven't see it all, over 100 acres worth so you can spend the day. Bring water or money for water and snacks and be prepared for a lot of walking and shoving to see what little you can inside some of the areas. And you enter in the south and exit from the north. Please plan that out accordingly as we expected to be able to come back from the south gate and see more and changed our plans."
"With 80,000 people visiting a day in Summer it is quite a bun fight to get in but we went quite early and would have been better not to have bought tickets in advance, where there was a queue, and just bought from normal kiosks where minimal queue. We had visited twice before so went to the more peripheral areas but always interesting and impressive. The size is underlined by the fact it fits so many visitors relatively easily! For less than £10 a visitor, it is also much more reasonable than some Chinese attractions."
A definite bucket list place to check out while in Beijing. Not to be missed. Allow ample time to explore the adjacent buildings. Be weary of the long security lines on the same side of the street. One can access the Forbidden City from the across the street which typically have shorter security lines.
The city is a fortress that is truly amazing in its extent and detail. A true demonstration of power and elegance by the rulers of that time period. Remember to bring your passport when visiting.
"Yes, now we can say we were there.
What did we see?
Very little -- because mostly you are attempting to look through the same window that MANY others are trying to see through.
What did we do?
A LOT of walking (to more VERY crowded windows).
There were 80,000 visitors the day we visited and I think we were pushed by most of them.
I returned home and watched an excellent documentary about the Forbidden City -- in air-conditioned comfort, with my western-style bathroom nearby. I truly don't expect or want foreign travel to reproduce my home conditions -- but I can honestly say that although I was AT the Forbidden City, I really didn't SEE the Forbidden City.
My advice is NOT to visit during the summer holiday season."
"4 th times - still re-innovate and messy - no manner.

Yes, they build good toilet, but still not good.

Under charming long history about this place - but they do not let us explore.

So, just walk straight pass by.

Finnish."
"Got there 8 am ( hotel had booked ticket, just took confirmation sheet to right hand side of inner ticket line with passport.
As we were there early the crowds were not too bad and we tended to go up sides of courtyards. Better view and few people. It was well worth visit and memorable. We didn't have guide ( on day 8 of cultural visit to China and have a good feel by now! ) but did read up a little before going. Took us about 1 1/2 hrs to walk through, only went in a couple of side museums which was sufficient as it is the overall architecture and scale which is so amazing"
Impressive and so much to see.. but try to visit in the late season. We where here in the midsummer and national chinese holiday.. much to crowded and to hot.
"Immerse yourself in this massive and enormous forbidden city. Lots of history and great things to see and learn here!! You can't leave Beijing without paying a visit to this attraction.
Tips:
1. Please don't forget to bring your PASSPORT (if you are foreigner) as it is required to buy the ticket.
2. The only entrance of the Forbidden city is at Wumen aka Southern Entrance (午门) while the exit is at the North Gate (神武门).
3. Please avoid to visit it during weekend / public holiday. Trust me, the crowd will drive you insane."
"My first destination in Beijing was the Forbidden City. Since it was a business trip, I had to visit in July, however I would definetely not recommend visiting this place during summer as it is also holiday in China and lots of tourist and student groups from other parts of China also come to visit. Hence, lots and LOTS of crowds.

Be sure to bring your passport. The ticket is registered to the passport and you won't be able to buy one without it.

Most of the buildings in the Forbidden City is not open for visit however you can peek inside. I understand the main reason behind this is the crowds.

Visit in an open weather if you can. You will have great photo opportunities. Be sure to visit the Jingshan Park behind the Palace and have a beautiful overview of the Palace."
"This was a great day out with my girlfriend, just remember to bring photo ID for a ticket to enter. Once in we paid for the GPS guide which talked you through each part of the city depending on the area you were walking through. All in was a great day out with beautiful opportunities for great pictures and memories! Would highly recommend a visit if in Beijing"
"We went on a Saturday and it was so packed of people, it was hard to understand how to get in, out and around etc...the queues to buy the entrance to the museum are a joke! If you are patient and like history go for it, otherwise avoid it especially on weekends"
I went there to take photos outside the park and know about lots of history. The place is very big. You should wear running shoes because you will have to walk far. I went there in the morning and finished my tour in the afternoon.
"First this is an excellent/even incredible event.

To avoid frustration GET TICKETS IN ADVANCE, one way is with a registered guide (my approach). Susan had the tickets before we got there, the route planned and we moved efficiently through a very, very large crowd.

The Forbidden City itself was very cool (I think some of the best pictures from the temple to the north looking back at the Forbidden City.

July August is vacation time in China, but we knew that going in, so planned accordingly. the Forbidden City itself was extremely enjoyable with lots to see and intriguing history (ours from the guide, but they rent audio tours in multiple languages if you prefer going it alone)."
"Having seen the Tian'Anmen Square area on tv so many times I was able to put thins in place. It's history, the buildings, and the gardens are wonderful"
"There is lots to see here and there is a lot of outdoors walking, so best to be prepared for the heat. Also important to plan your journey back, it was difficult to get taxis to pick up from the North exit and the buses were crowed."
A must while in Beijing... But don't forget to bring your passport as it is required to buy the ticket.
"I had no idea how big the Forbidden City was and I was shocked. It is huge. Just when I thought I have seen everything, I find yet another building. I was surprised to see how small the rooms were in spite of the vast grounds. It was hard to comprehend the size of the whole place. There are a lot of steps in and out of quarters, so remember to wear sensible shoes!"
"Just made the 4pm entry cut-off and with a 5pm closure, meant we had a only an hour to breeze through the beautiful place.

The moment I stepped in, I was reminded of the many Movies shot there and a closer look was fascinating.

But being a Sunday meant the place was full with people, so much that there would be no chance of a picture without another 1000 people sharing the screen. Early mornings on weekdays is a better idea of you want a people-less picture of these fabulous wooden structures that has been kept intact for 100s of years.

Being in the heart of Beijing, it is an easy place to visit and a must visit. The adjacent mountain part made from the excavations of the forbidden city is supposed to be a must visit for a birds eye view picture of the forbidden city. Unfortunately we didn't manage that."
This place is enormous. I really didn't expect it to be the size it was. Lots of history and great things to see. I was lucky enough to have a great tour guide to give me all the info and I recommend one while here. Awesome site.
"This was the most hectic place I visited in Beijing...crowds, crowds and more crowds!! I was fending off umbrellas and selfie sticks. It was very crammed and the pushing and shoving was very irritating. I was also conscious of losing my tour guide as it is so vast and thronged with visitors. There was a VIP/celebrity due to arrive during my visit so security prohibited visitors access to the internal buildings and lead to delays. That said, the Forbidden City is a must see and is very impressive just be prepared to be assertive!!"
"I'll preface this by saying palaces aren't really my thing, and I had already visited others in Asia. But this wasn't really that special compared to the others, just more similar looking buildings, and more people. Security is a hassle, I'm not sure if there was a special threat or something when I went, but I had to go through two security checks, I had a Chinese police officer ask me for my passport and visa, (apparantly that's required, so be sure you bring it). You also can't go out the way you get in, but the guards who don't let you exit can't speak English, so you're kind of left on an adventure to find the exit on your own. Looking back, I remember the crowds, security, and confusion more than the palace itself."
"Was an interesting place to go to, absolutely huge place! If you are not too fussed about going, there is park on the other side which is really cheap with has really nice viewing spots overlooking the forbidden city which were cooler than being on the inside I felt!"
"Super crowded. Long queues everywhere.

The interior of all the halls and chambers cannot be seen due to the placement of reflective glass and dim interior lighting.

Absolutely no crowd control. People were walking in all directions and creating human jams and bottleneck"
"We visited the forbidden city on our first day here in China. Tickets were cheap relatively cheap, although queues were long but constantly moving so no standing around waiting. We made our way through the forbidden city at our own pace, without a guide although there is plenty options for guides or audio guides at the entrance. Impressive photo opportunities and also some souvenir shops. Good start to the trip."
"My guide told me that every Chinese person is encouraged to travel to Beijing, to the Forbidden City, the museums, the mausoleum, the square, as this place represents the seat of power for both ancient and modern China.

We came in November 2015 on a partly rainy day, which was a blessing as the crowds were small (for China) and there was a mist. It was an incredible place, far exceeding our expectations. Reviewing the map (please see the picture with the map) it lays out both the structure and the inherent symmetry of the complex - it is surrounded by both a series of internal walls and a moat (more like a diversion of a river) and the symmetry extends to include both the inner and outer gates of the former wall (at the south entrance to Tiananmen Square).
It is well worth your time to explore the length and breadth of the Forbidden City - of course I hope you do go in the 'off-season'."
"I have visited the forbidden city three times, in 1985, 2005 and 2016. The crowds have increased over time while there has been much restoration work since my first visit. These days its mainly a walk through of the large complex best with a guide to explain the building features and history."
"The Forbidden City is MASSIVE, literally. And half an hour on your tour you'll wonder where's the exit. Well, it's at the end of the complex. The distance between the start gate--the Meridian gate and the end gate--the Divine Prowress gate is a thousand yards.

So, take your time, don't rush and exhaust yourself. And you'll probably wonder if you can fit Forbidden Palace for a half-day tour, well i don't recommend it. It's a massive, massive place with lots to see. It's worth a day. Even if you finished it half-day, you'll probably exhausted at the end gate."
"Plan to spend several hours here to really see all that is there to see. It can almost be over whelming at times when looking at all the details. Also, make sure you are wearing good walking shoes. It is foot traffic only."
"Besides hiking the Great Wall the Forbidden City was the thing I was most looking forward to in PEK and it didn’t disappoint! I knew it would be big but I wasn’t prepared for just how big it really is or for how many thousands of people would be there. Here are a few logistics: the ticket lines start to queue up about 0800 and they actually open at 0830. The cost is 60 RMB per adult and make sure you bring your Passport if you are a foreigner – we had to provide ours. The lines move quickly and you can enter the city though security immediately afterwards. When you first walk in everyone will be climbing over each other to go straight, I recommend you turn left immediately. Our guide suggested an excellent exhibit that not many people seemed to know of containing beautiful artwork and calligraphy from the Ming and Qing dynasty. There was also another exhibit with clothing from the period you could walk through too. Afterwards then join the masses in the main square. Once you file through you arrive in another massive courtyard where the royal throne room is where the Emperor held court. When these doors are open there will be at least 500 tourists jammed in the small space trying to take pictures. I am 6’2” and took my time wading through the sea of humanity to get a great picture of the throne – I suggest you do the same, but it will test your patience with all the pushing. From there continue walking north to the back section of the city – the first section was for politics and court, the back section is all residences. There are many really cool houses, streets and courtyards to see here. From there you must see the royal gardens before leaving out the north end – the gardens were beautiful. Having a guide is preferred so you can get the back story on all the architecture and history and you can spend a full afternoon here if you have time (and patience). I will say it was quite funny that many Chinese kept shoving their kids in front of my wife and I and asking to take their pictures with us. We are not celebrities of course, but my wife is blonde and our guide said many Chinese tourists come from inland and have not seen Caucasians before. Overall, you may have seen the Forbidden City in movies before but the size and grandeur are absolutely amazing and it is a must see."
"Go very early to see it. A new system since I last went with entry only through the South entrance. Exit only through the North exit.
A limit to 80000 people a day but don't be fooled and get late. We went and it soon filled up and I'm sure the capacity was reached.
No real details inside to see other than the Pagoda buildings which are all for a reason???
None actually have any artefacts inside them."
"An amazing place to visit .
Very picturesque and lot of history.

Spectacular architecture.
It will be better if you visit the place having some idea about the building.
At least the dynasties and the rule."
"if you are thinking to visit this place, please booking minimum 3 hours! this is soo big. the architecture is really special, you can see large halls and stairs."
It's a mystic place. Spend most of the time just trying to imagine how they were living in the olden days. Should have spent more time in that place. A day should be considered for visiting.
I visited the Forbidden city on 8th july. The place is huge and full of history. However even at 8:30 am it was crowded and the visit would have been impossible without the help of our kind guide Hai Min. I have booked a tour for this visit coupled with an excursion at the Great Wall at Mutianyu on beijinglandscapes.com. The price was reasonable for a private tour 85USD/person (we were 2). You could get a better price if you are more than 2. What I did not like was that we could not see the hall of the throne where the access was closed during this season. The guide explained that if you want to see more you should prepare your visit avoiding the high season (especially during July and August) when children have holidays and go in groups visiting all important places in China.
"It is built on 70 Hectares and as you cross through the three gates and go into the inner court, you get mesmerized at the beauty of Chinese architecture. A must see when in Beijing. Remember that it is closed on Monday's, so plan accordingly."
"If you are in Beijing then you simply can't miss out on this. It is absolutely huge, so needs at least an afternoon to do it and I think you could spend a whole day there if you wanted to.

The garden at the North side of it is beautiful, so make sure you go there. There are exhibitions at the East and West side and an opportunity to have photos in traditional Chinese clothing on the West side.

The ticket price is 60 RMB, half price for students and you need your passport to buy tickets.

It is opposite Tiananmen Square and you can get there via exit A of Tiananmen East metro station (line 1). Make sure you get the right exit as it is very difficult to cross the road if you come out the wrong side!

Name in Chinese: 故宫 (Gugong)"
"Firstly, the Forbidden City is everything you imagine and on a scale exactly as you would expect in China. You go through the security check outside of Tiananmen Square and then proceed through the gate under portrait of Mao, and continue walking until you get to the 'museum' ticket office. It's ¥60 to get in which is good value and you have the option of an automated tour guide headset for another ¥40 which has numerous languages. I took this option and it proved a good decision as reading the information boards proved difficult with the sheer amount of tourists. Take sunglasses and a hat!

Within the city, there are other pay as you go areas to take a look at if you want. Friends went to the treasure gallery and said it was well worth the extra ¥10 entrance fee.

It's packed. This place supposedly can get up to 80,000 people a day and it looks like it. If you're thinking of taking any tourist free photos, forget it. Near all of the main palaces you can not walk into and are left jostling for positions to take a look from the relatively small viewing areas. If you're not comfortable with crowds, particularly Asian crowds, this may not be for you. If you're willing to give it a go, push or be pushed.

In summary, if you've been to somewhere like Anchor Wat you may leave the Forbidden City a little underwhelmed. But it is still worth a visit."
"You will pass through many gates, and many squares on your trip through the forbidden city. If you are just not up for long walks, and you want to see the living areas, see if you can enter through the back gate. The museum was very nice. Also extremely crowded."
"Great place to see. The home of China's emperors. Very crowded, but quite interesting. It's nice to have a good guide who can explain the site to visitors."
"The Forbidden City is a nice place to go and learn a little bit of the history. When I went though, it was extremely hot and overcrowded. My friend and I left early without walking through everything. July is not the month to be in China!"
"I have wanted to visit the Forbidden City for years, perhaps because the name is so evocative of hidden delights. However, although this is an interesting place to visit, I was a little disappointed. Most of the palaces are empty of all artifacts, and those rooms that were furnished were blocked off so that you could only look into them through the windows. As there were crowds of people all trying to do this, it was very difficult to see anything and one could certainly not get much of an appreciation of the treasures within. It would be so nice to be able to get a real feel for how the emperors had lived and one could not really get this. In many palaces and stately homes around the world one is allowed to walk through the rooms and I think it would provide a much better experience if this were the case at the Forbiddden City. The watch and Clock museum had the most amazing collection of clocks that I have ever seen. However, it was incredibly dark in the rooms, I am not sure why, and I found it very difficult to read the notes about the clocks in the dim light. The palace treasure collection was also worth seeing. Be warned, the place is HUGE, and we spend about 4 hours there without seeing all of it."
"The palace museum is located in the Forbidden city and is one of the many interesting places to visit. There were moderately large crowds there on the day we visited, which was warm and sunny and I wish we had more time as there is a lot to see."
A great place if you visit to China must see the Forbidden city Palace. spend almost 3 hours inside the palace
This was a place on our list of things we always wanted to do and we were not disappointed. The city is much bigger that I envisaged and is steeped in history. A must see if visiting Beijing.
The Forbidden City in Beijing is a must do for every tourist in Beijing. The history of this city is mind blowing.
"It's my first time here and the experience is amazing. Although the lineup is a bit crazy if you go from TianAnMen East. There is also a side entrance nearby the WanFuJin area and you can cut through the super long lineup. Putting aside that there are many people in there, the place is amazing. Once you exit from the north exit, there is a park called JinShan park which is right across from the exit. When you walked up to the top of that park, it gives you the while view of the forbidden city. You just can't miss that."
"Impressive as seen in documentary. Saw maybe 2 rooms out of the 9,999. Wish more rooms were opened to the public. Perhaps it was the hype I walked away somewhat disappointed."
"Defiantly a must do. Bring some time as there is a lot to see and best is to watch the movie ""the last emperor"" before. Very beautiful, impressive and well-kept. Tour guides are everywhere. Try to bargain... Asking price normally 200RMB."
"The Forbidden City was one of our stops during our family's 3-day stay in Beijing. The Forbidden City was certainly a must-see and exceeded my expectations. It was much larger than I imagined, as the City itself contains several stages, each one larger than the one before it. It is extremely well maintained and presented and easily gives you the ability to imagine what it must have been like hundreds of years ago when it served the emperors of eras gone by.

I will say that this place is *extremely* crowded, and if you want pictures of the interiors of any of the buildings you will simply need to push your way to the front...just like everywhere else in China =]"
A must see when visiting Beijing; Half a day should be enough to visit the most important areas (discount of 50% for seniors)
"The museum closes on Mondays. It costs only RMB 60 yuan(us$10) for adults, and half price for students and folks over 60years old. So bring your IDs to show at the box office.

The museum is a very popular place and always crowded, lately there is a limit to allow 80k visitors per day. Of this 80k, 60k is for tourist groups and they have to purchase tickets online. So there is no more long line up at the box office! There are exhibitions inside the place that require to buy tickets to enter. We skipped that.

The museum is huge, once you entered inside, the big crowds will seem smaller. From Tiananmen Square to Wu Men(Meridian Gate)is one way traffic. Once inside, you can go different directions. We tried to avoid the crowds and go wherever appeal to us.

There is only one place you can have lunch, a nice air conditioned restaurant. It locates outside of the Gallery of Clocks and Watches. Or you can bring your own and there are benches through out for resting. There are stalls selling cold drinks and ice cream to cool down.

At the time of visit, there was free exhibition on top of Meridian Gate. The view from the top of the wall was awesome! We can see both outside and inside the palace. Most importantly, it was almost empty up on the wall! From there is one way walkway eastward to the Corner Tower. The displace inside is fantastic! It shows the complicated wood structure of the palace, the history and the details of the doors accessaries. A video of over 5 min long showing the whole palace from inside out! I don't have to fight with the big crowd to peek through two small doors to see inside the dark palaces. Here is air conditioned and so empty that the staff has to walk around to kill time!

We exit out at the Donghua Men(East Prosperity Gate). The exit will lead you to Wangfujing. And my favorite Peking roast duck restaurant Siji Minfu is right around the corner from East Prosperity Gate."
"It's an amazing and complicated place. You need a guide or, at least, an audio guide (40 RMB well spent) to make the most of the Forbidden City. Very crowded. One tip - stay until the guards push you outside, around 5'o clock, and you'll have the chance to see the place empty and take some nice photos.
Definitely worth a visit!"
"Out tour group took us there for a couple of hours, which is just enough to walk down the main path with a quick view at the major halls. Pretty dry, it would have been better to see fewer sights but spend more time getting a better idea of what the Forbidden City is like. It seemed like just a series of similar buildings and lots of walking from the entrance to the exit. We had high expectations and were disappointed."
"The Forbidden City is central to any visit to Beijing. This massive Palace needs a full day to explore, as it is many courtyards and buildings. Many cultural aspects."
"I am sure this is a great place, and the history surrounding it is unbelievable ... But with so many people hoarding every inch of the area, I was not able to appreciate it.

Tourism here should be better controlled as to enhance the experience."
"We would have enjoyed this experience more if it wasn't for the crowds of mainly Chinese visitors. Nearly wall to wall. 80,000 on the morning we went."
"Go - don't miss it - its tremendous - not only for history , architecture , understanding of culture but also with a daughter in tow - the location of final scenes in Mulan film! Everyone is just awestruck , so lucky to have been there"
"It is extraordinary but you probably guessed that. The history is fascinating and the architecture iconic. The statuary is varied and beautifully done. The garden at the end is worth the price of admission. Actually the ""Mountain of Accumulated Elegance"" portion of the garden is worth the price of admission--a mountain constructed out of huge stones that the building appear to grow out of--or vice versa. Stunning. As you leave, notice the moat that surrounds the walls and notice how this monstrous palace complex fits into the urban landscape of Beijing."
"A historical place in Beijing where you can understand the greatness of the Chinese Empire. All the temples and gardens are amazing, the details of the constructions are impressing. Even if crowded, a visit here is a must."
"visited this wonderful place during a business trip, the Palace is in such great condition and clean, the guides are fantastic and are full of information on the history of all the buildings, the Palace is just across from the square where it is good to watch the army raise and lower the Chinese flag each day......."
I made the mistake of not getting a tour guide or the electronic tour. Without knowing the history behind this grand place we were bored within the first 10 minutes. You walk and walk and it all looks the same. I would recommend researching the history if you don't want to splurge on a guide.
"It was built in the 15th century to house the Imperial palace where the emperor lived. It was so named because it was off limits to visitors for 500 years. There is extensive walking involved to view all the buildings, courtyards and gardens. There are an amazing 9,999 rooms."
It was crowded and you can only peer into windows. The only thing worthwhile was the garden areas. Entry requires your passport.
"We hired a guide, Jasmine. The cost was 200 CNY plus we had to pay Jasmine's entry fee. She was well worth the money. Jasmine was pleasant, informative and good to look at. We enjoyed the rich history and the unique look at Ancient Chinese civilizations."
"This is a must visit to see the beautiful and glorious dynasties era of China. Even though it is very crowded, the area is very large. Make sure you rent the audio information at the entrance to learn the history of China"
"I toured here tweny-three years ago with my husband and nothing has changed. It is a faulous experience to see how the imperial magisties lived in these dwelling. Much must be left ot the immagination, but it is truly a wonder to behold. I love China and Beijing, which was formally known as Peking plays a great part in my novel, The Secret Language of Women."
A series of red buildings of the same style with nothing inside and a crowd outside. Not very interesting at all.
"Came here in July while the Chinese students were also on school
Holidays and it was very hot and very crowded. People were pushing and shoving to see and take photos of inside the temples. It was very hot so the pushing and shoving wasn't good. As it was quite crowded, the photos always had lots of tourists in the background.

My tour guide was very knowledgeable and really went through everything in detail about history of the forbidden city which was helpful. If we went on our own accord, it would have been a useless experience because it was hot and crowded and the palace statues would mean nothing to us."
"Unbelievable place the size is like nothing else. Get a guide or it might just look all the same with out any information. The history and preservation is outstanding, be warned its bonkers busy so if you don't like crowds you will struggle but well worth it."
"A marvelous piece of Chinese history. Not only a place for tourists, locals flock to learn more about their history and culture"
"Located north of Tian'anmen Square, the recognisable facade stands visible from a distance away. Easily accessible via Beijing subway Tian'anmen East station, the ticket booths are actually inside in front of the Meridian Gates. Audio guides are also available next to the Meridian Gates at ~RMB50.

Big place that has lots of history, if coming here without a tour guide, hire an audio guide or do prior reading to have a better experience as there are hardly any information on the history of the place. Along the sides, there are museums and exhibitions (some would require additional tickets) and these also are quite limited in information. Otherwise it would feel like going through numerous gates and walking across paved courtyards. The private gardens towards the north end are quite beautiful but it is very crowded.

Toilets, refreshment shops and souvenir shops are mainly towards the north end of the city. Note that once you walk through the front gate that has the picture of Mao Zedong, it is a one way route all the way to the Meridian Gate before you enter the Forbidden City. If for some reason you need to exit once you've entered the front gate, you can exit on the eastern side of the Meridian Gate which is 1.5km walk back to the front gate.

Bring sunscreen/umbrella, water and walking shoes, and have a good time exploring."
The place is great for viewing the palace and knowing the history of China. It can be improved if the place set rules for visitors whereby allowing orderly manners for groups of people to view each palace. People are basically pushing and squeezing to get thru the crowds.
"I love the history in this place, but you do need a good tour guide to tell you the story and the different reasons behind some of the elaborate artifacts found. For city dwellers like me, i think this is the closet you get to something that is more then a century old and where many emperors from different dynasties had made important decisions that had made what China is now."
"Each section of this is interesting and a bit different in it's own way, BUT there are many many sections, we kept walking and walking wondering how to exit. It took ages, as there does not seem to be any part way exits, once in you have to proceed all the way through to the end.

Plenty to see on the walk through, it does get a bit of a 'seen it, it's similar' feel to it, so I suggest research first determine which sections to do in detail which ones to skip otherwise you may find yourself there all day!

You can stand and wander at the historical past easily here. Many movie scenes ran through my head in a few of the sections."
"HUGE, lots of walking, many, many buildings to view and explore, hard to see it all - and so isolating"
"Really enjoyed our time at the city but it really needs more rooms opened up, more signs, more artifacts. Just more of everything to break up the endless paving and red walls. This is a must do but there is so much that could be done to develop the site."
"I admit this isn't for everybody but I have a degree in Mechanical Engineeering.
It's well off the beaten track in the City. It's in the Eastern Palace area, it's accross the other side of the square from the treasure gallery. 10 Yuan entrance and you'll need your passport.
Inside the hall it's rather gloomy and there's a strong smell of oil. Most of the clocks are English from 1780 to 1840, I say clocks but mechanical attractions would be better. I suspect watching the parts (wings of birds, elephants trunks etc.) is the main attraction. There are also examples of French and Swiss clocks as well as Chinese clocks.
None of the clocks are working but there's a couple of good videos running showing restoration and their mechanisms. Not much in the way of history of the clocks (except maker and date) which is a pity as I suspect some of them have fascinating stories to tell."
"The grand squares and temple is quite beautiful, however, the temple has changed a lot. They now allow tourist shops on the palace grounds. I mean really? Do we really need to buy a t shirt and fake jade IN the palace grounds? They've taken great leaps towards turning it into a tourist destination which kind of kills the authenticity that MADE IT a great tourist destination."
"It's worth a visit early in the morning because it gets crowded.
It's a vast palace from the Ming Dynasty.
It's important to be careful of pickpocketing during your visit."
"I loved it, so did my kids. But we like history, slow movies, and Mr. Rogers. So, if you're into a fast paced lifestyle and you don't want to take the time to understand a little of the history - skip it. We loved it, but be prepared to spend a whole day. Food inside was a little disappointing and limited, so pack snacks."
"You can't glimpse the size of this complex set of halls/palaces.
Be prepared for a long but rewarding walk.
Lots of locals touring the place.
Overwhelming."
The buildings themselves give a graphic example of how the emperors lives and hence how Chinese society was ruled. You can have an audio tour but Terry to find one of the many volunteer guides. They're wonderful. But if you go in the summer during the school vacation be prepared to encounter the masses of vacationers who have just left school.
"The Forbidden City highlights the development of the Chinese culture as created by the different dynasties throughout its history. Its historic architecture has been preserved to give life to the many events that took place in the day. The first time I visited in 2014, it was a leisurely amble through the expansive number of buildings, steps and bridges, and examining the art work. We opted to forgo the recorded presentation and just read through the information noticeboards near each of the sites of interest. During our second visit, we took along a very knowledgeable guide who filled in the gaps with interesting stories and historical references which added real value to the repeat visit. Both visits were along with thousands of others, mainly Chinese families taking advantage of a national holiday to experience an important part of their past. But it didn't detract from our visit to this amazing venue and our introduction to the history of China and its rulers. Be prepared for a walk of several kilometres and several hours, if you want to see all the different sections.
The Forbidden City is situated directly across the road from Tiananmen Square, the site of significant activity in China's more modern history and surrounded by large and imposing buildings of a different era."
"WE found this site to be okay, no gardens or trees (apparently due to snipers back in the day) it was so big and all cement and it felt like you were in an oven slowly baking, take umbrella for shade as there is none and a wet towel and water."
"Our tour started in Tiananmen Sqaure and progressed through the walls of the forbidden city. The history and stories which are connected here are incredible, so try to use a good tour guide.
It's also packed at week-ends. A must see site in Beijing."
I was blown away at the size of this. Had no idea the rooms and gardens here. We were on an organized tour. Don't know how easy it would be to do it on your own. Watch out for pick pockets
"This historical place is beautiful and big. We need the full day to sightseeing all the palaces. This place is in the Tiananmen Square, the entrance is where a Mao's photo is located. The place is clean and well maintained... and looks old. In order to buy the tickets, ID or passport is compulsory, this is almost in all the public attractions in China. The Forbidden City is located outside the metro station Tiananmen East. Is a must to visit this place in Beining."
"This site is situated in the middle of Beijing and basically the heart of the city. We initially walked around the grounds and it's a fair walk, before our private tour took us inside to see the palace in all it's glory. It appeared very busy to us but our guide assured us it can be much busier. Also watch when wandering around and looking into the place rooms - the locals don't do queuing, and quite at ease shoving people out of the way to get a better view or picture. Coming from the UK this took some getting used to !! I'd recommend and English speaking private tour as this place is huge and this will give you a personal insight into the life and times of the dynasty. Absolute must do and fascinating experience."
"Ridiculous crowds, too hot and really only of interest if you are into Chinese art or that kind of history. 80,000 people max in a day ! Probably on many peoples bucket list but there are other temples and parks in Beijing that you can enjoy and get a sense of the Chinese history and culture, especially if time in short. I wouldn't cry if you missed it."
We got up every morning at 6:30 a.m. and was on the bus by 7:45 to see all the sites. This day the bus left us off and we probably walked about 3 to 4 miles going from place to place. I think I have a photo for this review.
"I was surprised at how barren the Forbidden City was. I expected there to be more treasures inside, but I learned that most everything was taken. It reminded me of the coliseum in Rom and how there is only the shell now. I am still extremely happy that I saw it, and I learned so much about the history of China by visiting. It was truly fascinating and eye opening."
this is the home of the last emperor. This is a giant complex. It stretches over several areas. It is next to Tiananmen's square
"Situated in the middle of Beijing this place is a massive palace complex with many palaces,ensure you have a good tour guide or a audio tour you will certainly need either.To get in you will need your passport,and if its a hot and humid day certainly water,expensive on site,hat and a good pair of walking boots due to the uneven ground.Most of the visitors keep to the middle of the city but if you have time there is plenty to see on either side as you walk though.There are toilets, not great,a few of which are European with no toilet rolls available.Certainly worth a visit just take your time."
"This was my second time and I was shocked at the crowds. My 11 yo daughter was trying to squeeze through pushing, shoving crowds to see the interiors. Worth seeing but maybe try Sept."
"The Forbidden City is a HUGE and interesting place, offering a glimpse into the history of Imperial China.

We rented the audio guide from the entrance and it was quite convenient. The attraction has several halls/structures, though visitors are not allowed inside any of them and you have to be content with listening to what the particular hall housed when the emperors lived there.

Warning: It is crowded and how. Be prepared for people jostling for a selfie and pictures. If you are visiting in the summer, carry an umbrella and lots of water - there is a LOT of walking to be done and the heat can be searing and draining."
"One of the best places in the world to see Chinese palatial architecture, Forbidden City's history spans almost 500 years of Chinese Dynasties and is a must-do when in Beijing. It's a very popular spot, so be prepared for the crowds and all that come with them.

A visit to the Forbidden City starts at the Meridian Gate, which is at the south end of the complex and just north of Tiananmen Square. The exit is at Gate of Divine Might, which is at the north end and just south of Jingshan Park. Since these areas are contiguous, it would be easy to spend a day going from Tiananmen to Forbidden City and finishing up in Jingshan Park.

The Forbidden City itself can be done in about an hour, simply walking the +1/2-mile from south to north. However, you can spend much more time exploring the 900+ rooms in the complex."
"It takes a long time to walk from one end of the Forbidden City to the other. 80,000 people are allowed in each day, so you want to get there early. Bring water if it`s a hot day. The buildings on both sides of the city are exact replicas of each other, so if you see one side, you`ve seen the other. It`s crowded and people push, so walk along the side instead of the middle -- less foot traffic and you get where you want to go faster & easier. There are multiple throne rooms, so you need to be patient in order to squeeze into the middle to get great shots."
Give yourself several hours if not the whole day. Purchase the audio tour. Do not miss the clock museum which is an extra 5 yuan. Also show your passport for discount on your entrance fee.
Certainly worth the admission fee to soak in the amazing history of the Forbidden City. It is amazing how huge the city is. One thing to keep in mind... normally I don't walk around with my passport but here you have to show your passport to buy an admission ticket.
The Forbidden City is probably my favorite of the places I've visited so far. Get there early and BRING YOUR PASSPORT or you won't be able to buy tickets. The flow of the crowd goes through the middle of the city....my suggestion is go to the left or the right of the city and you will be all by yourself exploring rarely visited sections with plenty of opportunities for pictures. Once you exit beware of the people offering rickshaw rides back to the south gate. NO matter how aggressive they get DON'T GO! You can find taxis not to far from the exit to the right or you can go to the left and take the underground walk way to the park that overlooks the Forbidden City. You will get great pictures at the top.
Any where you go you find the most decoration painted under the celling. But here with a very deffirent art. You will find the paintings on the ground. With great symbols of the history
"Our visit to the Forbidden City was a great experience. The place was very crowded, although it was the morning of a working day. The Forbidden City and the Palace are very impressive sights."
"This site perfectly captures the scale that was prevalent during the imperial era. In fact, the scale was such that the first British envoy to China actually knelt before the Emperor.

Taking a self-guided tour is easy if you use an English language audio set."
The Forbidden Palace is a vast and fascinating place. We rented the headphones tour and learned so much about this ancient place. Be prepared for crowds and lots of walking.
"The Palace is lovely and really cool to explore, but be warned: you will struggle to take a picture without another tourist in it. I rented the audio guide (for like $6) and found it to be really helpful and informative."
"What an amazing place. We went on Tuesday 28th June we took the subway which was very user friendly
Be prepared for lots of walking around and lots of people
But definitely a must go see"
"I thought it was a really long walk from the square to the other side of the ""Palace"". I found it to be cold and depressing. Lots of steps, and cobblestones. No flowers no plants."
"Firstly you have to queue to go through security, then queue for tickets. Don't forget to take your passport or ID otherwise you buy a ticket. I picked up an audio tour in English. The Forbidden City is beautiful but you soon get fed up with being barged out of the way by large groups of Chinese. After a couple of hours you just want to get out of there. The audio tour is helpful however. There was a wonderful exhibition of Fabergé on show during our visit which was lovely. The palace is vast so allow lots of time , take sunscreen, a hat and your patience."
"This involves a lot of walking, amiss lots of tourists. Shoulder to shoulder , hand to hand. Interesting architecture. Go and see this wonderful place and learn the history."
"we walked through the forbidden city , there are so many buildings and things to see all different to what you see at home well worth the visit but there is a lot of walking to do as it covers a large area"
"Our son arranged a tour guide who took care of all the arrangements. This place is amazing and seems to go on forever. While we didn't get to go inside any buildings, it was still very interesting and most impressive."
"It's great , for family day out . You can even make it a weekend get away for there is so much to see and do ."
"The Museum itself is huge and can take all day to fully explore. Take your time to enjoy all the nooks and crannies. Take in the architecture and wonder of this man made city, the symbolism, the artistry, the color selections- everything has been done intentionally. Words of caution- Chinese do not queue and they do push, which is quite foreign to American travelers. Be wary of getting in a crush of a crowd of people. You will find that you get swept up into that crowd and can barely move."
"Although many tourist sites in China are crowded (think of the size of the population plus all of the international tourists), people are really very calm and just go with the flow. Don’t stress if people might push past you; they’re not doing so in an angry way. They’re just getting where they want to go. That being said, if you can be patient and relax you’ll have a great time at the Forbidden City. Walk across Tiananmen Square on your way to the Forbidden City, making sure to do both as early as possible in the morning. Beautiful fountains greet you as you cross the bridge and step through the towering gate. Count the rows of nine “balls” on the massive doors at the gate – you’ll notice that only the emperor’s structures could have things numbered in nine, because that was the number reserved for the emperor. You’ll also notice nine guardians on the corners of the rooftops. Look at them closely and note the interesting warriors, animals, etc. Make sure to read up on or have a guide accompany you, as there are so many little details to notice (i.e. the huge pots used to hold water in case of fire). You can purchase an audio tour or hire a private guide. Definitely do one or the other, or you’ll miss learning about so many of the little details."
"We went to the Forbidden City on our own without any tour group. Our taxi dropped us off at the East Gate, and we had to walk to the South Gate to purchase entrance ticket. There was no taxi allowed at the South gate. It was a very pleasant walk from the East gate to the south for there was river and tree. Beautiful sight. After entering into the South gate where ticketing office is, our original plan was to go to the Front, which is the Tiananmen square from there. Then we found out from the guard we could not go that direction. They only let people enter from south to north, not the other way around. If you plan to visit the Tiananmen Square before touring Gugong, after being dropped off at the East gate, walk around outside. At the ticket office, they required us to show ID. We did not bring passport. Thank God they asked if I have any digital format of the passport and I did. Remember to bring your ID in order to purchase ticket. Anyone can be there near the ticket office, and there were so many people. Sometimes you don't know why some people are there. Be alert with your personal belongings. Every entrance had high security. No much queue. Once we entered, it was clean, huge and beautiful. If in the summer, be sure to have sun protection. It can get very hot. No trees for shade. We used umbrellas for sun shade."
"Essential, but very crowded.
Luckily the ""one-way"" system for tourists sort of helps.
Allow more time than you expect, as security can be 'slow'"
Although it was a very hot day and was surrounded by lots of tourists mainly chinese it was a great experience. The life of the ruling emperors was not easy. Although very pampered the ceremonial they have to endure on the daily basis was almost a torture. I will recommend a good pair of shoes an umbrella and water. There is lot of walking and no shade. If you can go with a tour guide that will tell you the story is better. Lots of amazing paintings and sculptures. Is a place to see for sure.
"Our visit to the Forbidden City met all our expectations. Fascinating buildings and exhibits! Get there early though to avoid the worst of the crowds and summer heat. It can become difficult to see and photograph things amongst the throng of visitors!

Book your tickets online (you'll need to enter passport details and take your passport with you on the day). For some of the exhibitions, you'll need to pay extra but it's well worth the small additional charge."
"I was traveling in a small group of people and we decided to take a couple of cabs down to the Forbidden City and check it out. To our luck we stumbled upon a guide name Yuan, a young student trying to make some extra cash who took us on a ride through the history of the city. Would recommend planning this ahead and get at proper guide even though we where extremely lucky with our guide, since there are some who try to get you to spend more money after the tour on a dinner at a dubious restaurant owned by a friend or a relative. The tour was long, so plan for a couple of hours to be able to see everything of interest and bring water and enery-bars, there is a lot of walking."
"Anyone who has not visited the Forbidden City (a/k/a Palace Museum) and considers giving it a miss based on the negative aspects reported in all reviews, should just rethink the entire idea of coming to Beijing. This is what China was all about until 100 years ago. Seeing that set in the context of what China is today is an essential experience.

All of the positives are true--it is an unbelievable city of picture-perfect palatial Chinese buildings, with some museums that have unique collections (do not miss the clocks). All of the negatives are true too--the crowds (overwhelmingly Chinese tourists) are huge and extremely ""pushy""--the worst we have experienced anywhere. The scrums at the doorways to the central buildings would make you think free cash is being handed out. People (all ages and sizes) have no hesitation to push/touch, etc. including one huge guy who leaned against my wife and reached around from behind to take a picture right in front of her face.

Like the rest of Beijing, be prepared for information in guidebooks to not match what you find--especially on logistics. Some say that there is a ""one way system"" in pace, others do not. When we visited, you could go any way you wanted--except out the gate you came in! No sign or mention of that, just people putting up their hands to everyone who thought they could walk out as they had entered."
The forbidden city reminds you how small you are and how much power the emperor had back in time. Amazing structures and it is definitely worth a visit.
The Forbidden City is a big palace. There are 9999 rooms for the emperor and his 3000 concubine. Beautiful place and a great architecture.
"Of course not. Same with the Forbidden City. This is one of the two things you have to see when you visit China for the first time. The other being the Great Wall.

Tiananmen Square and the Forbidden City are impressively expansive. There are tons of tourists there, but it doesn't matter because there are tons of people everywhere in the big cities. Be prepared for a lot of walking, including up and down several long flights of steps. Despite the crowds, it is pretty easy to push your way up close to get a good look at whatever you find most interesting.

The architecture is impressive and all aspects of it have some spiritual significance. I was disappointed that there was not much in terms of the interior furnishings of the palaces. Much of the grandeur of the dynastic period is missing.

It was interesting to learn about the commitment that the emperors had to the society, as exemplified by their frequent ceremonies and rituals designed to bring good luck, good harvest, or victory in battle."
"I loved the walk through the Imperial Palace. The place is unfortunately quite neglected, but it's still a great place to visit. Great to imagine life at court in the days of the emperors."
"A lot of people bring food and will eat them anywhere where there’s shade. We went during a hot day in May. Make sure to bring snacks, sunblock and lots of water. My family and I took the subway station to get to the Palace museum. To get here by subway, you’ll have to take Line 1 and got off at Tian’namen East station. Once you exit the station, you have to go through a security screening just right outside the station. Afterwards you’ll have to walk downstairs and head straight to the Palace Museum. There will be signs directing you. Once you pop up at the other side of the road where Tian’namen is you’ll enter it. Ticket booths are to the far left. You must bring a passport with you in order to buy a ticket. Prices in the summer are 60 RMB. The palace is huge and magnificent and will take time to explore. I loved the fact that you had to enter to many entrances in order to get to the halls. Make sure to stay hydrated! Once you’re done you can exit the East gate like we did but it takes you to a street where you have to turn left and walk about a quarter mile back in order to get to the stairs that will take you back to Tian’namen East Station. That street has tiny stalls and is quite busy. Just make sure not to stray and keep on heading straight."
"It was amazing walking through the Forbidden City and understanding the history. What's not so amazing is that you are there with sometimes 80,000 other people. My advice is go with the flow and experience the journey through the Forbidden city and leave your western frustrations behind!"
The forbidden city has such beauty and such a long history it's really a must see. The history behind it is amazing. Beautiful place and really worth the visit
"Who hasn't heard of the Forbidden City? If you are in Beijing, its a must stop to experience the historical culture of the Chinese. a real guide would have been better-the audio guide was so-so."
"Although its worth a visit, be prepared for a hideous queue to get in and swathes of noisy tourists around you. And when I say tourists, I mean hundreds and hundreds of tourists! Especially if you go in the morning. Once inside, you can appreciate the vastness of the place. Its huge! However I found it quite repetitive and in the mid day heat, unbearable. I much preferred the serene Lama Temple. I would not rush back which is a shame, given the history."
"I wonder how many ordinary folks were privileged to gaze at these imposing buildings during the heyday of the emperors - rather a few, I reckon. Now, the swarming crowds that freely pass by is indicative of how far humanity has progressed. Fortunately, our tour company slated the visit for the morning when the crowds were not overwhelming. But, unfortunately, the insides were not accessible to the public. I'm sure any views of the emperors' lifestyles & opulence would have made the experience all the more rich for the visitor. Regardless, the magnificence of the edifices and the beauty & uniqueness of their architecture surely leave lasting memories in whomever that were fortunate to behold them firsthand."
Fascinating history and so much larger than I expected! Gorgeous buildings and statues.Crowded of course but definitely worth spending a couple hours
"There is temple after temple. Be sure to wear good walking shoes and also be sure to bring an umbrella as the chinese do, for sun protection"
"Quite a large place. Lots to see and lots of peolple also.
Susie my tour guide with China Highlights was great and very informative."
"Whether you are interested in the history of the site or just the construction of the buildings this is a worthwhile trip. The palace buildings are very ornate and the construction was advanced for is time. Lovely to look at.

Apparently you should visit in the morning as it gets busy later in the day. Book tickets on line."
"Very interesting place. Prepare to walk a lot. Many galeries and rooms with art, watches and All kind of stuff. Too many People and staff rarely speaks english."
Simply Amazing. Huge. Be prepare to walk at least 2 KMs. Take time to explore. Better to go early otherwise you wont be able to complete.
"This is somethig you have to see in Beijing. But for 20 Euro entry fee, a bit pricy oin my point of view. This is just to enter the city. there are an other ~20 Euro for a musem and so on. If you wanna see all then its easys to spend 100€ a person"
"This is a huge site and often crowded unless you go in the cold of the winter. Don't try to see everything as it is all much the same and huge. Have a good wander through if you are not with a guide. Buy some water and food on the way in, don;t spend too much time looking inside the buildings as there is not much in there and it is all much the same. watch the movie first (The Last Emperor) and it will be more interesting. There is an excellent souvenir shop in the middle with some food and lovely air-conditioned toilets and AC waiting room which many people choose to sit ion for a rest. Make your way from the front to the back and sit under the trees. Or go through very quickly and then make your way into the beautiful park behind, up the hill (not very high - man-made) and look back down onto the Forbidden City. Some lovely photos in both places."
"Important to experience the walk through the halls, if you're not guided, electronic guide is highly recommended. Be aware of quite a few women, that might invite you ""to English in the park"". They approach solo men only. Don't know what might be their intention, but doesn't look innocent."
"Much larger than I anticipated.
Very interesting to see how the Emperor and his entourage lived back in the day!
Take your time and make sure you have a guide."
Massive 'city'. Enjoyed the walk through. A must see in Beijing. Box ticked! Make sure you have a guide that can explain the history of the Emperors
"Worth a visit although it was very busy, probably the busiest attraction in Beijing, it is an interesting place you need a full day to get around, can be difficult to take photo's due to the crowds As with some other attractions in China I was surprised to get a concession for being over 65."
China travel guide made exclaint tour Thier nice lake and arctic to learn more about china.alot off history
"This place is so huge. You can't possibly see it all in one day. There are so many rooms and things to see. Unfortunately our tour only allowed time to walk almost straight through. We had a little time to veer side to side, but not much. There is much to see here. Plan to spend more time if you can. Beautiful place."
"It has such a rich historical value and the mindset of learning about the place has to be there in order to appreciate this monument. The weather and crowd definitely plays a part. June is simply too hot plus the crowd, it just hasten the journey and people just want to walk to the end quickly - quite a pity. Especially for young kids and teenagers, they have little patience when it comes to crowd and hot weather. I went in winter period before and it's not ideal too as the layers made it inconvenient. Will try going in spring or autumn to see if it will make it better."
"Obviously this is the one place that you are expected to visit as a tourist in Beijing, so there's sort of an inevitability about your visit. So here's some advice:

Don't visit in the winter months (mid-Oct to mid-March) when it's just too cold and unpleasant.

When you are going there, do not accept any invitation to drink tea, view paintings or go anywhere with any ""friendly"" Chinese people that you may meet (they will try and con you out of money) (note: in all my time in Beijing, it is only around this area that I have seen this - ordinary Chinese people will not try and scam you into drinking expensive tea).

Be prepared for lots of queues - for the entrance tickets and then inside at busy times (try and avoid the weekends if you can).

Don't be surprised if there aren't many ancient treasures inside, apart from the actual buildings - most of the movable treasures were removed for ""safekeeping"" about 80 years ago - I'll let you use Google to see the details.

Finally don't be surprised if you spend an hour or so just walking from the entrance to the exit. This place is huge. Remember one of the main purposes of the palace was to impress on visiting barbarians how wealthy and sophisticated the Chinese rulers are. Plus ca change, plus c'est la meme chose.

Instead of the Forbidden City (gasp!) I would recommend the National Museum of China, which is on Tiananmen Square and has been recently renovated (but bring your passport) or out of town the Summer Palace is much nicer."
"Crowded, but cannot be missed on any trip to Beijing. Hire a guide to obtain thorough explanation of buildings, meanings, historic uses, feng-shui, etc."
"It is a one day trip to visit the forbidden city. You should book your ticket in advance, and it is worth to hire a tour guide."
"Everyone knows about the palace, but they may not know how huge it is. Plan plenty of time to visit it, and make sure you go to the temple on the north side of the FC as it gives a nice view and has its own historical value. The tough part of the FC is that you have to deal with so many folks trying to sell something or convince you to take a tour with them. Also, there is not a lot of original furniture here (as I believe it is in Taiwan), but you can still enjoy the grandeur."
"This I found not a great experience.
It's over crowded and as if you are being hearded like cattle. And not a lot to see really."
"I was less than impressed with this attraction. I went with my three kids (ages 5-7) and they were bored with it pretty quickly. We were constantly surrounded to take pictures and with it being so crowded and hot, that got old quick. We got through it as soon as possible, it took probably an hour. I am sure if we didn't have kids with us, we would have taken more time."
"This place is amazing. The temples are very beautiful. There is so much to see, plan for several hours to explore. The shops are interesting and reasonable prices."
We came to the Forbidden City with a guide-which I highly recommend. He gave us all the background behind everything and pointed out things I never would have noticed. Beautiful architecture. Great history! There are plenty of bathrooms throughout that are very clean as well. Great day- spent about 2 hours here.
"For those like me, saw the B. Bertolucci film ""The Last Emperor"" is really impressive the visit at the Forbidden City.
Throughout time of our visit we remember the entire history of the Emperors we are all the time waiting to see the last Emperor.
The stunning architecture. For me the only downside is the crowd of people with fewer people would certainly be agreeable! I recommend comfortable shoes because the visit is quite extensive."
"I've been here a couple times over the last 5 years. It's worth the time and effort to visit once, but there are more impressive places to visit in Beijing and it will really seem redundant if you've already been to them. How many old Chinese buildings does one need to see? Having a guide along helps as they can share information that will make it much more interesting. Otherwise it is just a vast place to walk around a look at. Most important value: simply so you can say you've been there. Visit the park on the north that overlooks the area, but watch out for the scammers and their bicycle rickshaws."
"This wonderful place is so large and so beautiful it really is amazing. The sense of history you feel while walking through the giant red doors as you enter the many court yards within the city itself is humbling, when you understand that you are walking in the steps of emperors and noblemen."
"Beautiful, worth the visit. Make sure to explore the gardens on the property. Bring your ID or passport because it is needed to buy tickets."
"a very very huge place with lots of walking ! you get here via the subway which may take a few minutes before you reach the ticket office. Do take note that the whole site is a way one passage and if you would like to exit, you have to take a detour from the eastern side back all the way to the subway.

It can be very crowded especially at a certain spot where people are trying to take the center view of the interior. Both local and even foreigners were pushing to get to the best spot, so you have to be careful especially you are bringing kids or elderly along."
This is again a must to do activity in your list upon your visit to Beijing. Very beautiful architecture.
"A must for all travelers this is easy to find and great at to tick off bucket list, admission was 60CYN make sure to take lunch catch metro as it is much easier then walking :)"
History and beauty in the temples. It was breathtaking to see the massive temples. Location is right by Tianeman square so you can do both in one afternoon. Audible guides are available to enhance your visit. Must visit attraction.
"Went with a guide we had hired before trip. Interesting to see the architecture and hear about the history. Did not go into any of the side galleries, and only spent about an hour and a half. Site is older than Summer Palace, but found Summer Palace more pleasant."
"It used to be called the Purple Forbidden City and it is full of rich Chinese history and culture.

The museum allows 80,000 visitors a day. Some tickets will be reserved by tour groups, and up to 40,000 tickets are available online for Chinese visitors 10 days ahead, so there are usually 20,000 to 30,000 tickets available on the spot. It is important for foreign independent tourists to get there and buy tickets as early as possible, especially during holidays. However, our travel agency helped us secure the tickets (60 yuan per person, 30 yuan per child above 120cm) beforehand. I would highly recommend that you engage a tour guide for this attraction because he/she will make the day trip more informative and effective.

This is a good place to spend half a day to take in the many buildings, pagodas, gardens, walls, sculptures, etc of ancient China and marvel at the amazing architecture and lifestyle of yester-years."
"With 800 buildings and almost 9000 rooms, the sheer immensity is astonishing. We walked through this and were enlightened by the fact that we had a guide, just for the two of us. This helped us significantly to understand and further appreciate what we were seeing.

Afterwards, we saw The Last Emperor again which was useful as a background to what we had seen earlier in the day."
"This place is magnificent and something you just have to visit in Beijing.. It makes you want to watch The Last Emperor again. I loved the place, but couldn't take the 50'000 other tourists all trampling over you to get another pointless photograph, and the sweltering heat.. Thought I was going to melt! But even so, I would go back again and highly recommend a visit."
"Well preserved but over crowded place. I have been here multiple times. The longest waiting queue is for the first security check to get near the forbidden city, there is another queue to get inside and another security check. Don't go here on Chinese holidays."
We visited the Forbidden City following on from Tiananmen Square and joined a long line of people passing through. The size of the palace is huge and although it is busy there are one or two areas where you can have relative peace. We did benefit from having a guide who helped make some sense of the place. At times it felt like being on a conveyor belt but it is well worth the visit.
"Best to go with a guide to give appreciation of the history and culture of the Imperial Palace. We went on a bike tour and our guide Lewis gave us tremendous understanding and history of the emperors and the cultural significance of the various palaces, concubines, jealousy, and drama. This is a story of a story of the emperors and the imperial palace. Its like being brought back into time and being there and wondering what it would have been like to be an emperor. Wow!"
"It is a good place to go and to know more about China. I availed a day tour with China Highlights, its not cheap but worth it! See and know what is about the emperors of China!"
"Could have spent much more time at The Forbidden City, so much to take in. we had a guide and the history was interesting. The buildings were beautiful and many of them. We were lucky as it was'nt very busy so had plenty of chances for good photos."
Its easy to forget as an American how old things really can be. I could have spent several days wandering this ancient place and learning about how Emperors lived and ruled.
"The Forbidden City (now known as the Palace Museum) is a must-visit attraction when you are in Beijing. It is the imperial palace for 24 emperors of the Ming and Qing dynasty. The entire palace is huge and comprises of numerous halls of different sizes for different purposes, such as residence, ceremonies, state meetings etc. The area can be divided into the Central Axis, East Wing and West Wing. Tourists can only enter the palace via the south (from the Meridian Gate 午门) and exit from the north Gate of Divine Prowess (神武门), located along the Central Axis. The halls located in the Central Axis are more elaborated, which are the halls where the emperor conducts state meeting and ceremonies. The halls of the east and west wing are mainly residences of the concubines, and other imperial family members. We spent around 4 hours in the palace to fully cover the main halls. There's a lot of walking through the large compound, so be prepared."
"What an amazing place! Truly unbelievable to find this in the middle of Beijing. It really is a city within a city.

The whole place is huge and it easily takes a couple of hours to walk though it. It is full of fascinating places to visit with lots of history.

Don't go on a hot day though because there not much shade!

If you're in Beijing you must visit this unique place - truly fantastic."
"This is probably something that you can't get away with not doing while in Beijing, however, I would recommend going from Tiananmen Square through the meridian gate and into the first square, but I'm not sure that the admission into the forbidden city itself is worth much more.

The temples are nice, but they are all copies of each other - seen one, seen Em all.

It's a huge complex, and we found it really confusing to find a way out (lonely planet said we could exit via the south gate however we were turned away from there and could only exit at the west gate)
We paid an extra ticket to view the clocks and watches collection, but they were all very dusty, I wouldn't rate it as too impressive.

So definitely, visit Tiananmen Square and go through Meridian gate (these are the most impressive aspects imho), but save the ticket price and go to the summer palace instead (via metro) as it has a wider variety of architecture to see."
"It is huge and impressive... Need to have a guide, or rent the audio guide. The numbers of workers to build it, along with the history behind each building is impressive... There is for sure enough people in China!"
"Again it's a tick and go attraction. Yes, squeeze through, take a few photos, then get out of there. After the initial amazement of size and scale, palace after palace start to look similar. Unless you are going with a good guide, the history can be lost."
"The forbidden city has its mysterious place in history. Learning from a local expert tour guide brought new light to the Forbidden city past and when inside, you almost feel like time stands still and with a little imagination you get transported back in the day when the emperors and their entourage were standing on the very spot you are standing today."
You can't go to Beijing without spending time checking out the forbidden city. Set aside at least 2-3 hours.
"This was a beautiful complex and for such an important historical sight it surprisingly wasn't too busy on a Firday afternoon. Knowing how quickly large palaces can get boring without proper context, we got the English audio guide, but it wasn't great. It focused on minute facts rather than larger narratives. I'd suggest doing research or getting a good book or guide to bring with you; otherwise, everything starts to look the same and it's difficult to appreciate the historical context."
"You definitely should visit the Forbidden City, but it's a huge place and it can be difficult to enjoy with the large crowds that flock there. The museum itself (just after you enter the grounds) was the best part of the experience for me, with the rest of the grounds all sort of blurring together for me. Many of the areas look the same, and it can be difficult to really enjoy all of it with the huge throngs of people around. Some of the smaller side 'museums' have some interesting pieces, so they're worth checking out. The gardens would have been lovely, but again, it was hard to fully enjoy them with all the people around."
"It`s beautiful but a little bored, the most exciting is when you are in front of it, but later it`s like all the same."
"With either a good guide or a good book of information, this place comes alive. It's enormous...and there's a good reason for that, one that makes sense based on China's historical relationship with its neighbors. There really isn't a way to go here without being crushed by lots of other people, but it's something you have to see to understand anything about China before the 20th century."
"The attraction is very well managed so never feels too busy. if there is a people jam, step aside to the walkway adjacent to the wall - also good for shade. Truly a wonderful experience with an unhurried feel. Take time to explore. There is a charge when just inside, follow the queues!"
"This is a sensational tour creating a sense of wonder and amazement as well as a sense of difference. So the emperor to protect his Ying Yang can only have ""relationships"" with his concubines or his wife between 19.00 to 21.00 hours. He does not attend to his bodily functions but has assistance. Doctors study his passings to determine what he must eat to keep in the best health for Ying and Yang.

Get a good guide and you will learn so much stuff, some of it weird like the above, all of it fascinating and builds an understanding of the way of life from those days in that country.

The buildings are fabulous, fascinating and it is a large area to be covered. not a quick stroll, you will need time to fully appreciate it all. Well worth it."
"I was bored by this. Walked around for a few hours, it all looked the same.

Went into some of the museums. In the watches and clocks one the security guard spat on the red carpet. We left.

The Oreo milkshake in the restaurant were good, the area with trees is the only part I enjoyed.

One to avoid."
"You can't go wrong and would be missing out if you didn't stop here. Be aware of ""helpful university students and professors"" wanting to show you their art. Nice folks but always a sale involved on the back end. 😀. Great photo ops but can be busy. Directly across from Tiananmen Square"
"The size of the Forbidden City is amazing so many buildings like a small English village.be prepared to be totally impressed with the intricate and .ornate architecture, the vistas and most of all the size. Built n 1420 just for the various Emperos and thir Court in thousands n title luxury whilst constant turmoil and starvation existed outside. A good guide can give you an idea as to how life and ceremony was as can Th first part of the film ""The Last Emperor""; shame all is so Spartan. wandering around to me was the highlight of our holiday. Be aware of the vast crowds, pushing and shoving - but unlike some countries feeling safe. Quick with those camera shots as nobody thinks twice about standing in front of you. Madness at the Hall of Supreme Harmony wishing to view and photograph the Throne. From thr Entrance Gate onwards all is impressive a fully day could easily be spent admiring one building, alleyway after each other."
"It need to be there that feel atmosphere of Forbidden City. Just will visit this place.
A lot of tourist there. All over the world. It is ancient culture of China."
One of the highlights of a visit to Beijing. A large place with lots of history. Worth having a guide or some source of information .
"Built in 1420. This huge palace where 24 emperors ruled and stayed in with their empresses, countless concubines, eunuchs, servants, guards etc. Many horrid acts had been committed in this grand palace. It was quite an experience to walk on the grounds and to peek into the many halls. Hall of Supreme Harmony- where the ornate throne sits. Several side halls or courts have been remodeled into gift shops now when we visited in November 2015."
"This is a huge site, walking through several rows of beautifully ornate buildings.
Our guide was so informative, making the tour even more enjoyable.
The queue at the entrance was actually quite short.We only had a few minutes to wait to actually get through the gate.
Would recommend this tour to anyone travelling to this area.Camera essential!"
Long walk and very hot. Lots of people and a scramble to see inside throne rooms. Cannot take photos of golden Buddha. Very nice but not a place to return to.
"This is a large place - there are large courtyards and buildings which the kings used for different things. After a while, it does get boring unless you are really into history. Note that you can enter the Forbidden City only 3 sides (easiest would be from the Tiananmen Square side). The exit is at the other side - getting to the entry from the exit by road is a chore. Please be careful hiring the Rickshaws outside this place. They will take you on a tour of the Hutongs (narrow lanes - scary as it is quite deserted and shady). We got a really bad fellow, who stopped in a narrow lane and forced us to pay 300 Yuan for a 15 minute ride. With my wife and kid in tow, I didn't want to take any chances and gave the money and let go."
"To see and walk around this Historic place,having read many books on the History of China, from Emperors to Modern Government! It was awe inspiring. The power of those olden Emperors.! The Palace has 9999 a Rooms. ,for 1 man! A must see for any visitor to China."
"One visit is enough, but allow enough time to actually explore all the alleyways instead of just staying in the main central path.

If you aren't interested in history, this is not the attraction for you."
"We went there on a very beautiful day. It was saturday, so it was a little bit crowded, but nothing that can make you experience bad. Very easy to get there by metro. You can take the metro to tiananmen square station. Once you get there, the entrance is free for most of the part. You just have to have tickets of the museum, if you want to go. We decided to not go inside the museum.
We went inside the forbidden city by the main entrance, and we left on the east side, where you will find a lot of moto-taxi and little stores. Very good to buy souveniers! If you want to go back to the Tiananmen square, you just have to walk the street all the way. We got a moto-taxi, very convenient and very cheap... After walking alot, it was worth it!
Reserve half a day to visit both the Forbidden city and the Tiananmen square... If you get there earlier, you will be able to skip the crowd!"
"Get an audio device at the entrance. 40CNY for an English one and 20CNY for a Chinese one. Be prepared to walk a lot. If you are fast you will probably still need three to four hours as the crowd is massive. A lot of jutting and pushing to move forward. Near the entrance of the different palaces where the different thrones are displayed, you cannot enter and can only view from outside. Very challenging to view the exhibits as there are so many people. You just have to go with the flow as everyone is there for the same purpose. After passing through the gates of Tiananmen, you enter the first palace. It is also the most glamorous. We must have passed through so many palaces that I don't remember how many. Each is unique and worth seeing. It leaves you in awe of how majestic the Chinese kingdom was and how powerful the Kings must have been back then. We definitely enjoyed this unique attraction. Be careful when you enter different palaces. Watched out for raised thresholds at doorways. Apparently it is believed that ghosts and evil spirits cannot jump over them. Our kids walked a lot and were exhausted by the end of it. Kept them cool with ice cream (5CNY each). Not recommended for those who do not love to walk, elderly and kids."
"Wonderfully restored for the Beijing Olympics
Allow plenty of time and avoid Chinese holidays - very busy
English tape guides available near ticket counter"
"Visiting the Forbidden City so intrigued me I went searching for films made there. ""Empresses in the Palace"" and ""The Last Emperor"" respectively give insights into the Imperial Household in its heyday and in its decline.
I was impressed with the way the buildings have been restored and are maintained and hope that visitors get to experience their awesome beauty for centuries to come."
"My husband and I won a Trip to China, This was one of many amazing stops along the way. To get to the Forbidden City we too a bus which was so busy i was shocked it actually moved. You don't see that kind of busy in Canada. We enjoyed walking through history and admiring the beautiful art work"
"With only a couple of days in Beijing, we decided upon the Forbidden City, the Summer Palace and The Great Wall. We were not disappointed after many other reviewers also recommended the Forbidden City. I wish that I had allowed more time than the couple of hours we had. The weather was incredibly hot and there is very little shade throughout. On entering, we found that the entry tickets had all sold out but that there were tour guides offering tours including the entry tickets - do haggle. This proved to be quite fortuitous since it allowed for a whistle stop tour of the major sights of the Forbidden City and to gain a good understanding of what had happened throughout Beijing in past and present day periods. Our guide was incredibly knowledgeable and the experience included a rickshaw journey (near death experience) and some very steep ascents and descents at speed on foot. BEWARE; At the end, we were offered the opportunity to have our pulses checked by a state run medical centre whilst having a foot massage, all for 20 yen - a bargain, yes right, I should have known better!? We had the massage whilst a ""master practitioner"" felt our pulses and proceeded to inform us of what ailments we were suffering from. Following that we were ""hard"" sold medication, based on pure Chinese medicine. When I say ""hard"" sold, it was one of the hardest sells that I have ever experienced and although I 'escaped', my partner bought one month's supply at 700 euros, yes 700 euros - thankfully she couldn't pay the 2,100 euros that they wanted for 3 month's supply!! Just enjoy the Forbidden City and then leave, you'll enjoy your time far more. Several weeks later, I still can't believe that we were so gullible :-("
This is a must when visiting Beijing but may not live upto expectations. It's 1000 metres of huge impressive court yard after court yard. It is incredible to witness but it really is huge. It was extremely busy when we visited which spoils it slightly. Good thing is you exit at the entrance to jinshaing park which is great as if you trek up there you get a great view of the city. I recommend going into the gardens to the left as you walk into the city. Beautiful scenery. All in all must visit but be prepared for it to be busy.
"Forbidden City (called Gugong in Chinese and شھر ممنوعہ in Urdu) is the largest ancient palace in the world and a UNESCO World Cultural Heritage site. It is one of the most important historical monuments, located in the center of Chinese capital city Beijing. For about 500 years, it remained royal palace for 14 emperors of Ming dynasty (1368-1644 AD) and 10 emperors of Qing dynasty (1644-1911 AD). Its construction started in 1407 and completed in 1420, during the reign of third Ming emperor Yongle Zhu Di, who transferred Chinese capital from Nanjing to Beijing (then called Beiping and later Peking).
Also known as PALACE MUSEUM, Forbidden City is a rectangle area covering 961 metres (3,153 ft) from north to south and 753 metres (2,470 ft) from east to west and consists of more than 980 buildings and palaces with 9999 rooms and halls, over an area of 180 Acres. It is encircled by 26 feet high and 28 feet wide wall as well as 20 feet deep and 170 feet wide water moat. In China it is as important visiting place as the Great Wall of China.
There are beautiful names of various halls and palaces in Forbidden City such as Hall of Supreme Harmony, Palace of Heavenly Purity, Hall of Celestial Union, Palace of Earthly Tranquility, Palace of Longevity, etc. Visit to Beijing is not complete without visiting FC. Entry ticket was 60 Yuan in April 2016. Minimum visit time required is 4-5 hours. Tour/Guides companies usually give 2 hours which is quite insufficient, unpleasant and laborious."
"This was a huge place to visit, there was a lot of walking involved but most of it was flat so not too hard to do."
Went there and it started drizzling. But still enjoyed looking at the building and architecture. You cannot go into the rooms to see and there is a mini crowd at spots which you can view the rooms. The place is humongous. You can buy your water and snacks from outside as it's more pricey inside. There are toilets in the palace. The place was really fascinating. There's a self service audio device which can be your guide. That was really helpful!
"The forbiden city is something which has to been seen. Tick it off, but there are nicer attractions in beijings"
"Everyone would visit Forbidden city when they come to Beijing. The attraction is relatively large and we spent 1 day in there including visit the special museum, e.g. jewelry and clock museum. The food in the restaurant is quite expensive but still affordable. Nice visit if you dont mind there are many people."
"This was a great experience, had very good success finding an English interpreter just inside the security checkpoint, was pretty reasonable and very knowledgeable. Thanks, ""Eddie""! If one wanted, you could take in the china state museum (free) Tiananmen Square, and Forbidden City all in one day,

This whole area is a definite must see in Beijing"
"The Forbidden City was an amazing trip through hundreds of years of history from the 1400's onwards. The complex is very large and i cant say I saw it all in the 3 hours we spend there. It is probably 4+ hours to go through it. It is worth getting the automatic guide recording.

It is busy on a peak day 80000 people go through this attraction."
"This is something you must see. Be prepared for crowds. Carol had a private guide and driver for us.
The history here is fascinating."
"You really need a guide to do this right. We entered from the South Gate and went through to the North. Probably need two hours to do it right. Word of caution. DO NOT buy anything from the vendors outside the North gate. Most of them give counterfeit money in change. If you do buy something, make sure it is EXACT change. Also, you can negotiate them down to almost nothing if you work it hard enough and keep walking"
"A historic cultural site. Very large and takes time to do - we had a local guide which helped a lot. There is no shade, so be careful if a hot summers day."
I'm a history fan and the forbidden city is fascinating. The scale of the place is astonishing and you certainly need several hours to do it justice. If the security queue to get in is huge then cross the street for the queue into Tiananmen square. From there you can go through the underpass and into the forbidden city. There are side areas that require an additional fee. Pay it. It will take you away from the crowds and show you much more intimate areas of the site. Well worth the small fee in my opinion.
"This was worth going to for sure. Because of the size of it, it justifies the price and the audio guide was worth the extra price for some additional info. If we would've had more people it'd have been nice to split the cost of an actual tour guide as I think that would've been more engaging and interesting."
"A must visit in Beijing. Less crowded weekdays , or early in morning. Avoid major China holidays (early May and early Oct). Expect a 3-4 hour walking visit, starting from main entrance at south and ending at North entrance. Getting a taxi directly outside after exiting can be a challenge as drivers request too high prices - walk a few hundred meters down the road to get one."
"Ancient building with skill without latest technology

Ancient day organisation of the structure of a Family

Buddhism Temple and Ancient Time without a Clock"
"We took a guide to the Forbidden City. Made the walk from the Tiananmen Square to the Forbidden city side much quicker. The Palace is worth seeing and the guide was very informative. As with most places you have to have your bags scanned, can add to the waiting time if crowded."
"It is such an overwhelming experience to visit the forbidden city especially it is such a place packed with history and culture.

We went there on a nice sunny cool April Sunday thinking it would be overly crowded. But the place was busy but not as bad as we thought.

We had a great time there and the place is simply amazing. Unfortunately we only had 4 hrs there and only get to see half of the palace. Would love to return and explore more."
"The history of the Forbidden City tells you so much about the history of China. To start, that this immense swath of land was only for the emperor, empress, concubines, eunuchs and servants and occasionally, certain merchants and visitors. It truly was forbidden for the common residents of China. That even within the Forbidden City, certain paths and buildings were only for the emperor. There are huge metal vats distributed around the buildings that held water in case of fire. Each roof is decorated with a series of small statuettes or roof charms in a procession. The number of figures in the procession indicates the relative importance of that building. The roofs in the Forbidden City were allowed to use the royal golden color. There are spectacular opportunities here to take photos of the lion statues against the brilliantly colored tiles of the buildings. Expect large crowds here. We were told that visitors here are limited to 80,000 per day!"
"Visited here with a friend early June, 2016. The museum closes at 5:00, but they stopped letting people into the room with the clocks. There was full of construction/re-construction throughout the palace. Walking around the whole place took some time but there seems to be enough rooms to see and if one's really interested in the history, there is enough English information in front of all the major rooms.

In terms of the artifacts, it is really disappointing, but the Chinese government is not to blame as the Nationalist party took almost everything valuable from this place and moved them to Taiwan. If you visit this museum and the one in Taipei, you will feel that there are more substance in the one in Taipei. So I am impressed with the palace itself, but not the exhibits within the palace."
"For the two hours we spent at the Forbidden City, we had a great experience taking in the sites and the history. There was no line for us to buy tickets considering it was noon. Yes, there were a few security screen points; however, the slight inconvenience was worth the reassurances of safety in a large crowd.

Wear good walking shoes, have a hat, and bring water. There are vendors galore, but most people don't mind and end up supporting them.

We didn't use a tour guide because we researched the site before walking in. There are signs to help explain the buildings. I enjoyed my experience!"
"I visited the Forbidden City around a year ago and really enjoyed it, but I remember finding it too crowded at that time. This time was EXTREMELY crowded. People were pushing just to get a look inside the palaces and I visited with my parents and nearly lost them in the crowds on a number of occasions. It was a shame because the place really is beautiful but we found that after a couple of hours walking around we were ready to leave as we didn't want to deal with the crowds anymore."
"Rent an audio tour! There is almost no explanation in English, and the audio guide is very informative. The audio tour is based on GPS (so if you're standing in front of a temple the audio tour starts). The audio tour is an additional 40 yuan.

Please avoid going in weekends and holidays, since it can be really crowded."
"I cannot state any more than previous reviewers, only to confirm that this is certainly a site to add to your bucket list.
You will need to have plenty of time, a lot of water, and comfortable shoes, and of course a good camera."
"A few things to bear in mind when visiting this wonderful, historic and grand place which housed around 24 emperors.

- You can only get in from the North gate (Tiananmen square). You exit through the south gate right in front of the Jingshan park. The view of the Forbidden city from the park is truly amazing. I do highly recommend it.

- be prepared to be bamboozled by sea of people which includes tour groups. It was the most crowded place we visited in Beijing.

- You need to queue up by the square to go through security checks and will need to carry an ID to get through.

- after you gone thorough a corridor Museum ticket office is just before the main gate on your left. There are a number of counters so queue isn't too bad. We went very early so only waited about 5 min but waited longer to go through security (30/40 min)."
Amazed that it was built when technology is not that advanced. To experience all that space and history is amazing. Worth a visit whenever you are in Beijing.
"This giant complex with palaces, smaller buildings, relaxing gardens is the most beautiful example of traditional chinese architecture.

The Forbbiden City is definitely a place to enjoy and to have a feeling of how imperial times were. Don't plan this one to be your last sight to see as it closes to public relatively early: 4pm"
"Big, beautiful and a really fun n way to spend the day. It's a bit redundant but go off the path a bit and discover the sides instead of just the middle. The architecture is pretty amazing. Details of various carvings are impressive and fun to photograph. A variety of lenses are needed to maximize cool pics but iPhone worked fine too. I believe it is free. Very little shade and no where to buy anything when inside."
The Forbidden Palace was fascinating. Make sure you allow plenty of time. Wear comfortable shoes and a hat. Then soak up the history. I suggest you get a local guide as there is much symbolism and history to understand.
"It's trite to say it, but after you have seen one palace, the second and third look a bit the same.

Very, very busy so set aside some time.

Well worth a visit because ""why not""?"
One of the must see places if your in Beijing. I advise to not come on a Public Holiday because this place will be PACKED. Watch a documentary on the city and then save your money and skip the expensive tour guide
"we weren't able to purchase tickets online, as you need a china CC or alipay, so, we took our chances to buy tickets at the gate on a sunday and got in!

we arrived around 830am and as soon as we turned the corner to arrive at the north gate entrace - we were slammed with thousands of tour groups. at that moment we were afraid the 80,000 tickets might indeed have already sold out. luckily for us, we still got tickets despite the crowds.

we rented the recorded audio in english for 20yuan (approx $3.50), which is GPS so you can just walk and it will start to speak when you reach each building location. the central axis is a zoo, so we opted for the east route which was quiet and had much fewer people.

you only have viewing access to most buildings, so don't expect to be able to walk thru them. the jewel exhibit is worth seeing for the extra 10yuan (approx $2) but i say you can skip the clocks exhibit..unless you really like clocks. it took us about 3.5 hrs total and we were so exhausted, we headed back to our hotel for the suana and pool."
It was Huge and amazingly build by human on that time. Called forbidden to normal people that time and now open to public. Not much relics was found as most of them in Taiwan. However the building itself will make you feel amazing and wondering how it was build. Many part to visit each places passed through is not same actually. strongly recommended to visit if you in Beijing.
"The space in which the ""city"" is contained is huge. The structures in the city are enormous and well preserved. You can not enter many of the buildings but can look thru the windows to get a glimpse of what the furnishing were like. Like many sights in the city the crowds are dense. Go early and you may get thru a good portion of the site.
Worth a visit."
I can't begin to tell you how big this place is...overwhelming to be kind. Combine that with the history...and you're on your way to an amazing day! From the very start it was imposing. We entered on the Tiananmen Square side...and you're greeted with Mao himself...larger than life. Once inside you will have an experience that will stay with you forever. We had a flight to catch...so we chose the 1.5 hour blast through tour. Wish we could have stayed longer. But...sometimes you have to grip and rip.
"Entrance fee is RMB60. Only allowed to view the few important halls through open doors or windows. Very crowded and I was shoved, elbowed and hit by selfie sticks. The halls are bare except for a throne or a bed. All treasures are kept in other halls which requires separate entrance fees. Better to visit the National Museum of China if you like Chinese history and art."
I was glad I had taken a walk here on the Monday when it was closed to get a sense of what it is like without thousands of tourists. On the next day I then joined the throngs of tourists to be pushed and shoved to get a look at things - people do not hold back and if you want to see what's inside the palaces you have to be ready for a bit of flesh pressing. But this place is so spectacular and grand and so serene in its perfect symmetry that the noisy crowds of tourists just didn't seem to matter. You can get a sense of how imposing the buildings are against the throngs of people and try to imagine what it must have been like if the Emperor ever had an audience with his people. I highly recommend this.
"The Forbidden City is a place of great historical significance and cultural heritage, and in a way it epitomizes history. My workmates and I have a sense of transcendence when walking through the Forbidden City. The building, the tree, and the stone, they all have their own endless history."
"The Forbidden City was interesting to see but let us down in a few ways.
1. It cost 60CNY which is a fair amount more than most other attractions
2. You have to go through extensive queues and security which can take hours on a busy day - and don't forget your passport!
3. You can't get inside any of the buildings, instead have to try and peer through thick, dirty plastic screens which you often can't get close enough for the crowds."
"If you're in Beijing, you're probably going to go here. It's an immense place. Be prepared for some walking. It's also very crowded. If it's hot, bring water. There's not much shade. Probably a bit overrated but still cool given all the history behind the palace.

I've seen recommendations that you need to buy tickets ahead. I'd say unless it's a holiday or something, don't bother. We were there early and there were no lines for tickets."
"After traversing Tiananmen Square, we took a short walk via the underpass (to bypass the road traffic) to get to the south gate (Meridian Gate) of the Forbidden City. This the only entrance for tourists and in addition, tickets and audio guides are sold on the square before this gate.

Our tour group was there in the afternoon after lunch and it was busy. Photo ops at the various buildings can be a challenge as people are trying to get to the front to take photos of the buildings’ interiors as there is no public access. You are literally shoulder to shoulder with people vying for a good spot to take pictures. Lots of jostling around but be patient and you will eventually get to a good spot for a photo-op; unless you’re tall like some people, in which case you can shoot over them!

We spent 2 hours wandering around the grounds of the Forbidden City. After 2 hours, some of the buildings started to look the same.

After the “main” tour, our next stop was the Imperial Garden on the outskirt of the main buildings in the Forbidden City. There are some interesting rock formations here. We spent about 30 minutes touring this garden.

You can easily spend 4 hours or more at the site. In fact, the Palace Museum website has an itinerary for a full day and two 4 hour tours.

I would rate the attraction at 4 out of 5 based on what we saw due to the tour’s time constraints.

Notes and Tips
• Be prepared to do a lot of walking.
• Wheelchair access is possible at some sections and not others due to the uneven pavement plus lots of steps. Entries into the buildings and courtyards are protected by doors that have a “step over” to ward off evil spirits from entering the buildings. These step overs are about 6 inches (15 centimeters) or more.
• After exiting the north exit you will see a building on a hill across the street, in Jingshan Park. I found this out later but the hill is entirely man-made – built from the excavated soil and rocks that form the moats and canals around the Forbidden City.
• Get a map of the complex, so you know where you’re going. Better yet, do research before you go. You can also go to the Palace Museum website and do planning. For example, it provides different itineraries depending on your time resources
• The Forbidden City is about 15 kilometres (9.3 miles) from the Beijing West International Trade Hotel where we stayed.
• During our first full day in Beijing we visited the Temple of Heaven, Tiananmen Square and saw a performance of the Peking Opera. See my reviews.
• The next day, May 6th, our attractions included the Great Wall of China. Reviews to follow."
"What an abundance of Chinese history lies within these walls.
An absolute must for anyone who loves learning about the past"
An important site that the Chinese government could do a better job of making available to their citizens and tourists. Definitely visit but realize there will be big crowds. Still worth a visit and quite impressive.
"I was only in Beijing for 3 days on business so no time for lengthy tours. Hired a private guide recommended by the hotel. They drove me into the city, had a whistle stop tour of the forbidden city and then back to the hotel in less than 3 hours.

Probably not the way most people would choose to experience it, but just sharing it can be done and is well worthwhile.

The palace from end to end is extremely interesting and leaves your mind in overdrive as to what it must have been like when it was inhabited."
"We were here on a Gate1 17-day tour with 38 others. This is one place that is HUGE beyond belief. It seems that you walk thru one courtyard after another. We were here in 1986 and are still in awe of this place.
We had to cross several underground passes to enter the Forbidden City, which was the Imperial Palace until 1912. It is a huge walled complex and marvelous Chinese architecture. It has over 800 buildings, with 9,999 ½ rooms. Why this odd number? Only the Supreme Being has more rooms than the Emperor.

It is one huge place and we only had about 2 hours. Commentary: When we were last here in October, 1986, we were able to see SOOO much more than now. Part of it is that the government has closed off many rooms, due to the 60-80,000 tourists daily. We were able then to see the Emperor's Command Throne, as well as his bedroom, which is now off limits - a shame, but we understand that's due to govt. trying to restrict the number of visitors, as it is slowly exceeding the capacity of this place. I am glad that we were able to come here WHEN we did in 1986!

There was so much to see that I couldn't possibly remember every building or sight. Sorry"
Scheew. Nothing like it i the world. Truly. You will get no spoilers here. Take a camera with alot of space and be sure to dress for the weather.
This place is steeped in history. An amazing place when you think of when it was actually built. Easy to get to. Well worth a trip. The square outside is beautiful. Around the outside is a beautiful walk along a river. Architecturally stunning. Colourful. See it all.
"This is one of the top attractions in Beijing with so much history to see and learn and a excellent look into the history of China .

The place is very large with such much to see and learn . It is also very busy all day . Security is very tight so be sure to leave all of iffy things at the hotel to avoid trouble.

Plan plenty of time to see everything , tours rush you through the highlights . Early in the day seems better ."
"Who doesn't want to go somewhere with ""Forbidden"" in the name?? The City itself is rather awe-inspiring if you allow your imagination to take you back to it's glory days. Whether you are interested in the history, the art, the architecture, or just the experience - visiting is kind of a ""have-to-do"" when in Beijing. And at 60 rmb for the ticket, it is one of the cheaper attractions to visit. If you have not been to any temples previously, expect to spend a couple of hours here. If you have been in China awhile and seen a few temples already, an hour should do it. Not recommended for kids - they will be bored out of their skulls.

My biggest complaint, and warning, about my visit is safety. The crowds, even at mid-week, were insane. At one point people were literally being pushed off of a ledge and smashed into walls as the people jostled to get a picture. There is security everywhere, but this did not seem to be a concern to them."
"One has to check out the forbidden city when one is in Beijing. Admission is 60 Chinese dollars (about US$10) during popular season, and 20 Chinese dollars for students (with ID) and children (need some type of identification to show age). Make sure one brings passport! We got one adult, one student, and one child admission, and the rep at the ticketing office asked for our passports. One can rent an audio tour after the deuce its check; it costs 40 Chinese dollars, but it is very much worth it. It tells one interesting stories when one walks through the park (no need to punch any button); it is fully automatic. Besides the palaces on the Main Street, East Six Halls, West Six Halls, the imperial garden, and the treasury on the far eat, no other part of the park is open. Recommend to check out all palaces on the Main Street, one of the six halls (where the emperor's concubines lived), and the imperial garden. If one is not on a budget, the treasury is highly recommend.

Do note the admission to the treasury is separated from the park admission. There are many gift shops inside the park, and personally I really like the keychains and magnets. A keychain goes between 35 to 50 Chinese dollars each, and a magnet goes between 10 to 35 each. They are well made, definitely better than the ones sold outside the park. Food and water can be expensive inside the park. A set of meal (Chinese meal) is about 30 Chinese dollars. A sandwich goes between 20 to 35 Chinese dollars. I brought my own water to save money buying it in the park. Bathroom is a bit rough inside the park. Most Chinese people enjoy using their own type of toilet, which is a ditch on the floor. There are western toilet but make sure you bring your own toilet paper, because there is no seat cover or toilet paper to wipe!

Do note one cannot get a cab right outside the park. It is restricted. Recommend to take any bus from the bus stop on the left hand side of the exit and get out of the area. I took bus 109 and got off at Jian Guo Men Nei stop, where I found subway. One can also great a cab at that stop. Bus fare costs 1 Chinese dollar if one doesn't have a bus card."
"This is a Truly Amazing Space in the middle of an Amazing City.
After watching the Last Emperor and Other Movies it is Great to Walk around and Soak up the History. I went around On 2 Days and noticed so much more on the Second Day. Time Permitting I am Sure if I went there a 3rd Day I would notice More but BJ has so much to Offer."
"The Forbidden City was a great visit and thoroughly enjoyed the tour. City is huge and seems to go on forever. A lot of history here.
Beware the public toilets and spitting!"
"Well! The forbidden city is rich in history and is beautiful in itself. But the crazy crowd makes it very difficult to enjoy.
The Chinese tourists talk loudly, break queue and just don't care if you are taking a picture or admiring a view.
We just did not enjoy it inspire of having a good guide"
the forbidden city is huge! i felt like we walked and walked and walked...the buildings are beautiful and it's an amazing site to see...
"The forbidden city is a must! We had a perfectly clear, blue skies day. Exhibits are well worth seeing, such s rich history. Would definitely recommend the Forbidden city and palace museums as a must when visiting Beijing."
This was a very cool place to visit but I wouldn't spend a great deal of time here. I enjoyed seeing it from above at Bei Hai Park almost as much as walking through it. I wouldn't discourage from going I would just say keep moving because it seems to be repeat of other temples and buildings.
The Forbidden City is vast and the museum pieces are a spectacular insight into the life during the reign of the Emperors. It is superbly preserved with so much to see. Be prepared for big crowds
"A lot of history. Worth visiting with guide. Lots of people, and not many rest area. Other than structures, not many other things to see."
"The Forbidden City is on an epic scale but there is a risk of being""palaced"" out by the sheer size of the site. The architecture was stunning and the symbolism fascinating but by half way, after two hours I was suffering acute information overload.

Earlier we had spent time at the Temple of Heaven which is on a smaller scale with similar symbolism and architecture but more peaceful and less crowded. We had time to stop and think, we could appreciate the wider picture.

I am unsure that you need to visit both and my advice would be miss the crowds."
"While outside of Forbidden City, I opted for an English guide (someone just standing outside) who charged me about $75 US dollars after negotiating. I figured that I could probably get a cheaper tour somewhere else, but at least I was helping one of the locals out, also her English was pretty good so I didn't mind. I had a great time learning about the history of the Forbidden City and more about Beijing through her. It's worth getting a guide to walk you trough this area."
"It's Huge. Go with your expectations in check. Know what you want to see, and in what context. It is rather barren when it comes to being able to spiritually absorb the culture. Museums there do not convey the history and arts as thoroughly as they should."
"Move south to north then explore those Palaces with courtyard on the right and left which are open to the public. Its beautiful and magnificent. Try not to arrange or follow tour group as you will be rushed through, rather, arrange your own timing and spare half a day to slowly enjoy this historical site."
"If only for the historical significance and grand scale, the Forbidden City is a must-do. We went early in the morning (9am, I think) and there were no problems getting tickets near the main entrance. The palace is huge with lots of rooms and buildings to explore if you have time, or you could just walk through the ""middle"" and finish in an hour or so. Either way, it's a pretty cool experience."
"AS others have noted in their reviews, this place is truly amazing. It's very large so I really needed more time than the one hour that our tour allowed. We did have a good English speaking guide and that was helpful as he explained the history very well and the significance of the various symbols, etc. Although they do limit the number of visitors that can enter each day, it's still extremely crowded which makes it hard to really enjoy it and see everything you might want to. When we visited quite a few buildings were closed. But despite the crowds it really is a ""must-see"" place in Beijing. The line-ups to enter can be very long which is why we booked a tour to be sure of getting in that day. There is an on-line website to purchase tickets in advance, however the website is all in Mandarin so we couldn't find any way to buy them ourselves ahead of time."
"The architectural structure alone is a reason to visit the forbidden city. Ask about the significance of the bow bridge and how the marble staircases were brought into place. It's fascinating! Be sure to wander through the sides of the courts to see the different areas of men's and women's living quarters that were offered to servants and family.
One bit of advice. Go in the cooler months of spring and fall. Summer is extremely hot and crowded."
"You can just imagine the Ming emperors dispensing justice from within these walls. It is amazing how many people were needed to keep the place running smoothly. There are still some artifacts to be found inside, but mostly, you are impressed by the scale and design of the buildings and grounds. The buildings are wood, so they survived earthquakes. The were, however prone to burning down as they did on a regular basis. The giant brass bowls filled with water for the purpose of putting them out were mostly ineffective."
This is where I have wanted to go for a long long time. Well worth the wait and this is a place everyone should visit. It is beautiful and you are amazed at how great the architecture was in the time when this was built.
"It was sooo busy! At the ticket office they advise that the daily capacity has been reduced to 80,000.... That's a lot of people! I'm genuinely contemplating choosing a career path in ancient Chinese architecture just so I can go back after hours. Despite this it's a must do when in Beijing!

There's not much to say about the Forbidden City that isn't already general knowledge to tourists, I would however advise doing some research before (the BBC has a brilliant documentary somewhere on the Internet) and practice your pushing and shoving skills. If your western, prepare to have your picture taken at least 10 times!

The museum is easily accessible but the metro (Line 1) so unless your doing it along side other venues in a tour I would recommend finding your own way there."
"We spent the best part of a full morning in the Forbidden City and the square. It is just so huge that words and pictures cannot do it justice. It was a picture perfect day in Beijing the day we went, and very, very hot. There are lots of stairs between the various parts, but some amazing photo opportunities. Be prepared for some very strict security screening as you go in, with metal detectors, frisk searches and baggage checks. My wife had a body spray confiscated as it had a flammable label on it, so they are pretty full on with what is off limits. Great experience though, and not be missed. It is very popular with tourists from both overseas and locally."
Enjoyable walk through numerous buildings with tourists everywhere. You start in Tienanmen square then walk though the gates of the city. Bring walking shoes. There is water to purchase inside.
"I have visited the forbidden city two times, but not by choice. I went with my wife the second time. I enjoyed it even less the second time. It's a LOT of walking and I can't even describe the size of this place. It's huge! It will take you 3-4 hours to trek through this place. It's all very overwhelming at first, and beautiful, but after two hours, they all start looking like the same old buildings. Glad that I saw it, but will not do it again."
I was not prepared for the the sheer size of the Forbidden City. At a minimum you will need 4 hours to explore this property. I recommend given yourself 5 to 6. But note that this site is closed on Mondays except for holidays. It is also extremely busy. The number of tourists there at the time I visited must have approached over a thousand easily and this was on a Tuesday. It's located just steps away from Tiananmen Square and it is worth every dollar spent. It tells an extraordinary story of the life and times of the dynasties that ruled China. It is appropriately called a city because the size and number of buildings on this site is enormous by today's standards. I can only imagine how overwhelming the size was during the period of actual use.
if you are there even for 3 hours take two hours and see this amazing palace!! and take it off the bucket list!!!
"The Forbidden City should be on everyones must do list when in Beijing.For years off limits to commoners it is worth a visit.Surrounded by walls this place is huge and a lot to see inside.Statues,gardens,beautful Buildings and lots of people.It is easy to get lost so it might be best to have a Guide"
"This was the most amazing place I have been to. I would highly recommend going with a tour group since the palace has so much history and interesting facts. Be prepared to walk, a lot! There is so much to see and one could spend a whole day there if you go into every building. Although I think going through the main corridors and listing to a guide fill you his facts was plenty of time. If you are traveling with kids take a carrier since there are many thresholds and cobblestone. This was definitely one of the highlights to our trip to China."
"Spent about 2 1/2 a 3 hours at the Forbidden City impressive spaces and buildings, really nice marble carvings of dragons and a must see as part of any visit to Beijing for the first time, other than the buildings and carvings very little else would inspire me to want to visit again."
"Forbidden city is definitely worth going. Amazing experience, especially if you are interested in history. We spent there nearly 8 hours and, if all exhibitions would be open, we could spend more. Just be aware that a lot of buildings is closed due to renovations and they don't inform about it up front, so you might end up walking miles for no reason (36000 steps done in forbidden city alone!).
Electronic guide is the best you can possibly get - but it's far from perfect. Difficult to navigate and it switches off from time to time - we had 2 and they stopped same time usually. No way to speed it up or repeat information already said.
One warning- it is really crowded. It gets up to 80000 (yes, eighty!!!!) Visitors a day and they are acting terrible. They go everywhere, most of them is really rude and they don't care about anything. It was most challenging in our opinion.
As well, very little staff speaks English- be patient if you have issues."
"From the moment you first lay eyes on the Forbidden city it is so impressive.
Huge wooden gates guard the entrances. As you move through the gates the buildings are astonishing and no wonder so many Emperors called this their home.
From the marbled steps, heated underground pathways, bronze figurines and incense burners 6 feet high through to the concubines residences and glorious garden, this is a not to be missed attraction.
You will remember every step and every moment"
"We had a layover fly and we took advantage of a tour, the company was tour -Beijing. Great company to deal with easy to deal with 100% recommend it."
"What we know as the Forbidden City is now officially called the Palace Museum, and it was the home for 24 emperors over almost 500 years. Once reserved for the emperors, the imperial court and specific dignitaries, the City could not be trod by commoners on threat of death. The construction was a monumental undertaking in the 1400’s and was the largest palace complex in the world, holding some 980 buildings with 9,999 rooms. It is protected by a 20-foot deep moat and a 32-foot high wall. It suffered devastating fires repeatedly during its tenure and was rebuilt numerous times and is now being restored. You enter through the Outer Court, which was the administrative part of the complex. You walk through a large expanse by going over one of the five marble bridges crossing the moat, the Golden Water, to make your way past the bronze lions through the Gate of Supreme Harmony where visitors were received. Crossing another expanse, you reach the Hall of Supreme Harmony that was reserved for major ceremonies, including enthronements of the emperors on the Dragon Throne. Look on the eaves for the roof guardians, which give some indication of the importance of the building (the more, the grander) since they are supposed to protect against fire. The central ramp leading up the 3-tiered terrace where the hall resides contains a magnificent marble work of art that had to be moved in a single 180-ton block 31 miles from its quarry. It depicts dragons chasing pearls among clouds. While you can only fight your way to the entrance of the Supreme Harmony Hall to get a glimpse inside of the magnificent throne, we warn you that this area is truly a combat zone and you should determine how much life and limb it is worth to catch that glimpse!

After that, we skipped a few of the lesser halls that were also similarly choked with people, and instead made our way to the Inner Court with its Palace of Heavenly Purity, the imperial sleeping quarters. On either side of the inner court, are the smaller halls that were the residences of the concubines and imperial offspring. In this area, you can view some typical furniture and furnishings behind glass.

Finally you get to the back of the Forbidden City to go through the Imperial Flower Garden that is laid out with pavilions, temples, halls, and a rock garden. While it might be lovely when quiet, do not expect a peaceful and relaxing interlude as you make your way through the garden. We’re afraid you don’t get a quiet visit to the Forbidden City unless it is frigid and snowing like crazy!

Once you exit the Forbidden City, you can get a good look at the moat and palace wall with its beautiful Arrow Towers standing at the four corners. It is a lot to grasp while you are in the midst of such a large and overwhelming complex. Do yourself a favor and do some reading to get more familiar with the various halls and sectors of the Forbidden City before you go and you will be able to appreciate it much better when you are in there dealing with the crowds. You will also be able to prioritize your time since there is simply too much to see in the Forbidden City in one day."
"The Forbidden City is a must see when in Bejing. Once you are in you have to complete the tour which takes a couple of hours or more but well worth the cultural experience. The Forbidden City entrance is adjacent it Tiananmen Square, so if you visit the Square, you'll want to add the Forbidden City to your destination on the same day. There is a fair bit of walking so be prepared.
It is impossible to enter the Forbidden City and not be moved by the history of the place, If you watch the film The Last Emperor it will give you some idea of the running of the place it is much larger than we thought the grounds are vast with many palaces and buildings court yards and gardens truly a great place in chinese history"
"One must visit the Forbidden City on a China sightseeing trip or on a trip to Beijing as it is a definite highlight. However, unless you have a great English Speaking guide, or unless you truly have a love for Chinese history, you will get bored rather quickly. It’s awesome to see and to get a sense of the grandness of the ancient kingdom but the crowds, the selfie sticks, the weather, the same looking building after another can be too overwhelming. I am glad I went to a top ten thing to do in China, but the feeling of wow was gone after 30 minutes. I’d recommend a tour with someone whose English you can understand or else it will get frustrating rather quickly."
"I have wanted to see this place for many years and I can say it was worth the wait. If you go, go on a week day because the weekends are way to crowed."
"Too many people ruin what could be interesting.
If you come there, you have the feeling you are going to a rock concert at a festival. There are everywhere guided tours with there flags, microphones etc. Then inside the city itself the masses are just pushing straigt through the city from hall to hall.
Admittedly you can escape that partly if you turn left or right and to see the smaller halls etc. BUT if you're in the forbidden city, you probably also want to see the ""main attractions"", so you have to join the crowd in the middle.
It gets even worse, when you want to have a look inside the halls. It's plain impossible without fighting against a army of selfiestick/smartphone soldiers. Unbelievable annoying, which is why I just skipped the windows to look inside after 2 attempts.
Also in matters of architecture and cultural heritage, I must admit, that I have seen more impressive buildings in China. It's kind of stale and the ""style"" is rather repetive. But that's a total subjective opinion.
And to end on a positive note, it's worth the money, at least if you are a student, because than it's really cheap (30 CNY)."
Prepare for a long walk. Mostly buildings and not so much treasures that you can really appreciate but the marvel of it is that the expansive area that no one in this world can ever imagine. Ancient culture is so rich in China and that alone is magnificent to experience.
A must see in Beijing...the city still has an unmistakable aura of grandeur and pomp...the place is steeped in history...what would have liked to see more staying areas with furniture and other residential items to glimpse the era gone by
"Forbidden city, as the name suggests is no longer forbidden. It is open to people and is always populated by locals even midweek. The throne is beautiful, the architecture is wonderful. You'll find all tourists with selfie sticks, trying to click pics, thus blocking all the view."
"Wow, what a beautiful city. We went on China's National holiday weekend but it was still roomy enough. The only problem was when looking into the roped of rooms, people with selfie sticks put the stick 1 meter into the room right in the middle of everybody else's photos. Good information signs about what everything is so you don't really need a guide."
"Hard to compare against castles/palaces built in Europe/Elsewhere at the time, as this place is ornate and massive.

Cannot miss while in Beijing"
Such a large and grand place. We only spend a few hours there. You really need at least a day to see the whole thing.
"Not as impressed as I expected to be given this is probably the main tourist attraction. Unless your heavily into history with all the dates and names etc it gets a little boring looking at one building after another. What did not help was the automated tour guide which seemed to be talking about somewhere else. We spent around 2.5 hours and only saw the buildings on the main route south to north. Would recommend it but would not go again.
If possible try and get the hotel or someone you know that speaks Chinese to book the tickets on the official website (Chinese language ticket booking only) to prevent having to wait in queue's as there are thousands of people."
"A must see destination. They only let in 80,000 a day and I think there were that many there! It is HUGE. We were not familiar with what to expect but were pleasantly surprised. Except crowds and where there are photos to take, expect to be jostled. The colors are amazing. Note the gargoyles on the buildings. Would recommend you purchase the audio tour guide as they shared some interesting points....you only need one per group and then share the info. Keep moving through the Palace as it is a large distance to cover.
History to see and experience. BrING YOUR PASSPORT OR IDENTIFICATION."
"Visited here two weeks ago with a tour group. Enjoyed our visit but unfortunately it rained which took a little of the gloss off the visit but that's travel.
Very impressive set of historical buildings which could tell some stories I bet. Quite a bit of walking to get there and around the complex itself. Can also be very crowded but then most things in China are. A must see when in Beijing."
"It is iconic, huge, a must see. The architecture is unique, the colours in the wall and ceilings are vibrant and astonishingly beautiful. Most of the buildings in the complex look the same and you can easily get confused with their names, which go as ""Hall of Supreme Harmony"", ""Hall of Preserving Harmony"", ""Palace of Heanvily Purity"", ""Palace of Earthly Tranquility"", etc, etc, etc. Try to remember all names and their exactly location in the complex. It is a fun exercise! Don't miss the Imperial Garden. It is gorgeous. The Forbidden City has in its wall a rich history, being the place where two dynasties have lived (Ming and Qing) before the Republic. Only two dynasties??, you might ask. Well, it comprises year 1420 until 1912. I recommend the automated audio guide, which is not expensive and is fairly reliable (depending on the language you choose). I have chosen my mother tongue (portuguese) and it was not particularly good. English might be a safer bet. There are different museums inside (separate tickets to enter them if you have bought only the general access at the main entrance). Outside the complex is also highly interesting. You have water surrounding most of it (great pictures) and from the main entrance you can see the Tiananmen square and on the Forbidden city main wall you can see the giant famous Mao Tsé-Tung picture. Don't miss the Kneeling elephant sculpture! It is located close the exit of the complex."
"Surrounded by the crowd but it's worth to visit!! Amazing decorations that have historical background. Recommend to arrive there early, so you can get photos of yourself with nice backdrop and without people!"
"One of most amazing places I have ever seen. The simple fact that most of the Forbidden Coty is still well preserved. It is unbelievable.

Walking through the Forbidden City from beginning to end will easily take you 90 minutes to 2 hours. But it is well worth it. Just looking at everything and thinking back to the time of the Ming and Qing dynasties is just enough.

If you are a history maniac, then this definitely is the place for you. It is one of the most beautiful historical places that I have ever seen in my life."
"Having just landed in Beijing we decided to go do the main big attraction we went early in the morning so I'd suggest get there very early as soon after its like a sea of tourists , prepare for a lot of walking as the scale of this is massive and especially on a hot day , beware it's closed on Mondays , it's an incredible place to see and experience however the amount of people just made it a bit annoying as I've never seen so many people in my life in one place however it's a must visit place when in Beijing have fun ! :)"
"No visit to Beijing is complete without a visit to the forbidden city, The place is steeped in histort so do get a guide or at least a decent guide book, so you can understand the history behind the buildings, It is also one of the most popular sites for tourists so it is packed with people which can be uncomfortable on a very hot day. The buildings and grounds are fantastic, and you could easily spend a day here, but sadly as I was part of a tour we were limited to only 2 hours. Do allow time to look at the ornate gardens behind the main temple they are very interesting."
"A vast complex of seemingly endless and similar buildings.

Front entrance is via the Tiananmen gate where Mao proclaimed the founding of the Peoples Republic of China.

Inside the most interesting building is the Hall of Supreme Harmony which sits on a marble terrace.

If visiting Beijing the Forbidden City is a must see!"
Huge complex of buildings with amazing architecture. I loved every bit of the place. Too crowded even in the weekdays though. It's a must visit landmark in China.
"The Forbidden City is fine and if you have plenty of time in Beijing, then try to make it. However, it is very crowded and doesn't feel authentic as compared to other attractions. If you are pressed for time, then I recommend checking out Mutianyu, the Ming Tombs, and the Summer Palace as alternatives. By the way, the Forbidden City is in the Palace Museum (they are the same thing for those who might be confused like I initially was). Safe travels."
"It is a great place to visit, but I have never been in such a crowed place. It took us nearly 90 minutes to cross the gates. It is frustrating why others doesn't like to make lines and they are pushing you and getting in front you without any respect."
"It is huge , beautiful , grandiose and very interesting . Make sure you go very early in the morning , because the rooms you can't go in and you have to look in through the windows so once it's crowded it is a battle to get through and have comfortable shoes , a very long walk . i just Walker and admired the architecture and the history . To look inside the rooms I just got the book , wasn't in the mood to fight and being pushed."
It was an interesting place to visit but the people were too many and the shops everywhere seemed to take away the ancient ambiance expected. The electronic tour guide is good. Don't pay someone to take you through. Anyone coming up to talk to you is trying to scam you so just ignore them.
"This place is huge. Thousands of people view it every day. It can appear very crowded.

I recommend taking a slow visit and using the outside of the three paths through the centre of the city. This avoids 90% of the crowds and let me relax and enjoy the history.

There are several areas along the middle path that you should not miss. However, you must prepare for Chinese tourists to push and shove to get to the front. It is very uncivilised and stressful but sadly it is true. I recommend seeing these items and then swiftly returning to the peace of the side route through the city.

At the other end of the city you can exit onto a road or see the side palaces.

I highly recommend seeing the side palaces and the courtyards. They are less crowded and contain many interesting buildings and windows to look through.

I also recommend either a guide or an audio guide because without context it is probably not a very interesting place."
"Great landscape , they have golf cart for those who have trouble walking around . The restroom was not well maintained , needs more restroom throughout the park . There was an ongoing construction , so it deters to picture some views :("
"We visited the Imperial Palace or Forbidden city on a weekend that had clear skies & no smog & were rewarded with breathtaking views & postcard picture photos. Plan to be there early as the sheer numbers of people that flood in through the gates everyday is mind numbing (over a million a day If I remember rightly!!) The crowds make photography a little difficult so you may have to wait patiently for ""the perfect shot"". The complex is huge & takes some time to navigate around... be sure & see any of the smaller museums & displays within the complex. The only negative for the duration of the visit was an elderly Chinese lady & her husband who were targeting tourists to pickpocket...she rumbled through my jacket pocket (not discreetly either) which was luckily empty & then casually strolled off like nothing was wrong & looked for other tourists... I stuck a camera in her face & took a shot which she was none too thrilled about so have your wits about you & don't have easily accessible valuables in pockets or bags..
All in all a good visit though & well worth the admission price.. allow at least half a day to see the best of the complex...great stuff!!"
"999 rooms 1000 would be unlucky! It is a vast place and along walk through, so worthwhile. A pity most of the treasures were taken to Taiwan. Walking shoes and cameras essential. Avoid saying anything derogatory in the square Tiamen."
"It's a very huge huge place. It was April and the weather was very very nice, wear something comfortable for walking. Going there you have to queue for quite long time for the security check. Just be advised that each place have some fee to be paid for entrance. Not really that expensive though. Line is long but moving fast cos a lot of counters are opened. Just remember where you enter cos as I've said its really a huge place to walk."
"It's not forbidden any more, and this historical venue has to be visited to appreciate the history of China and its dynasties throughout the years."
"I visited early on a Friday morning, I tried to pre-book tickets online but the website is only in Chinese. If you are part of a tour group this may be organized for you but if you're traveling alone get there early to purchase tickets.
Visitor numbers are restricted to 80,000 per day and you can only enter via one gate and exit at the northern exit. The ""city"" itself if huge, be prepared for long lines, lots of walking and minimal shade & areas to rest. Wear comfy shoes and bring water.
Tickets are 60RM, remember to take your ID/passport as this will be required.
Once inside you will visit several halls/palace buildings. There is a lot to see but given the that you're surrounded by thousands of other people at the same time everything takes a bit longer than usual. Give yourself plenty of time. The imperial garden towards the end was fantastic.
The Forbidden city is well worth the visit however you will get elbowed at least once during the day and have achy feet!!
I was advised to go to Jishan park (across the road from the exit) for a great view of the forbidden city but I was too tired & hungry at the end of my 2.5 hour stint - I'll save that one for next time!"
"This has to be one of the great building complexes of the world. We visited twice, without a guide or an audio guide. The. first visit was for five hours and the second for two. The first visit is overwhelming and a second is highly recommended. I also advise getting there early to enjoy at least the side courtyards free of tourist hordes. Most people just walk straight through the middle but the choicest parts are on either side. The ceramics gallery by the Eastern Gate exit is stupendous, as is the three tier opera house in the Treasury area for which you pay a supplement. I discovered that anyone over 65 gets in everywhere in Beijing at half price, so take a passport or driving licence. If you are really fussy, take a god cleaning cloth to wipe the finger marks on the glass cases enclosing some wonderful precious stones and jewellery! And try not to be irritated by the gazillion selfie sticks. The whole experience is wonderful."
"I'm a lover of history and museums and this place was a dream, pick up an audio tour and lose yourself in the palace. If you do the route down the middle it's just mobbed with people but go off to the left or right and you'll find yourself at times on your own...which amazed me... and the place oozes history. I spent 3 hours it wasnt enough, to do all of it if you're a museum type I'd say 4-5 to do it all and do it justice."
"We came unaided and not through an organized tour. Going there was easy through subway red line 1 exit C. There were plenty ticket counters where you buy entrance tickets which costs RMB60 per adult and RMB20 for child. Make sure you have any form of ID while purchasing. I was not able to bring one, fortunately, they accepted a copy from my mobile phone. We were prepared and and wore very comfortable shoes as it would take a lot of walking in going in and around the huge complex. It may be best to visit in the late afternoon where it may be breezy and not too hot. The queues going in the initial security check outside the complex were long but fast moving. Crowds were thick as it was a Sunday and it,was closed every Mondays. You can also either join a group with a guide for a fee or rent an audio guide for RMB100 while inside the complex. Huge, historically relevant and horrendous in size. The only thing that differed from other palaces that I have visited in Asia, this one would not allow you to go inside. They would just limit and cordon off from the outside. A good 2 hours will be sufficient to cover the entire visit."
"It was a lot of walking.
It's very interesting place.
I recommend to visit it with comfortable shoes.
This place is always crowded. Per information by the gate, the daily limit of visitors is...80 thousand people!!!

RomanP"
"Lots of walking, but worth it! Even if you cant walk a great distance, go and see it, find a cafe and people watch, and you can tick it off your wish list!"
It's very crowded. There's not much shade so stay hydrated! Watch your step because the stairs are uneven. Do this with Tiananmen Square. It's a must see but a quick do.
I am glad that this place still exists. One suggestion: rent the automated guide. It is not expensive and it really helps to understand the history of this well preserved museum.
"The structures are breathe taking and the court yards a photographers dream. But most of the ""main attractions"" were a tourism nightmare."
Expect queues and go with comfortable shoes because you enter from one end of the palace and walk all the way out at the other end. The palace is actually a series of smaller palaces and vast halls for public occasions. It is fascinating. Of interest is also a small palace at the side that houses mechanical clocks that we gifts from the West for the court.
"We visited the Forbidden City in May. We had an awesome guide named Gerry provided by China Highlights. Gerry was very knowledgeable about the Forbidden City and was able to answer all of our questions as well as give us an outstanding lesson on the City. Gerry's English ,both speech and comprehension,was great. I would highly recommend Gerry and China Highlights"
"We completely underestimated how much time it would take to see the Forbidden City. This is truly beautiful, and we found we wanted to pay extra to see the Treasures exhibit on the north east side of the palace. The best souvenirs and art are available at the gift shops in the Forbidden City. If you want to take home art, there is an artist in residence, with original painting for sale. Pace yourself and bring snacks.

We had our favorite China experience here. We were sitting down, taking a rest when an elderly, Chinese couple walked by, glanced at us, took a double take, burst into excited chatter; they took lots of pictures of themselves with us; we all ended up laughing; it made our day. It is still super rare for some folks to see ""foreigners"". It is an important experience to be a minority if only for a few weeks."
The entry has three gates middle one for king and queen other are for major and minor officers. There are palaces with throne and meeting halls. Very well spread out with a large area for living quarters. All building have a historic Chinese brightly painted architecture
"The place itself is interesting and vast. Beijing lets 80,000 people enter the palace museum each day, so there are tons of people! To counter this you can arrive early in the morning or late in the afternoon"
"It was really crowded. It was really hot with very few places to cool off.
We rented the headphone guided tour in English. One broke down, the others would occasionally start over. It's triggered but the different areas you visit.
We went and we were happy to see it as it is impressive in scale. To the uneducated and untrained eye it all looks the same. The stories and history were lost on us as we are not Buddhists not Chinese history buffs. After an hour in the heat and crowd we bailed. Then walked over to tiananmen square.
It was a hike.
Google doesn't work in China and we found bing a little slow and out dated. I only mention because we tend to rely on google maps at home and when traveling."
"It is a complex that looks like a stadium, with a parade ground in the center. The doors were massive and the structure bold and art is intricate. We came here during the Chinese Valentine day so there were so many Chinese couples wearing gowns and tuxedos. The cypress were very old, trunks were solid and hard. The doors were huge and heavy and it is interesting that this place is still well preserved."
I am not even a historical person but this place made me take a step back and truly appreciate this part of China. The city itself will be packed but is worth seeing. The gates you go through seem endless and the architecture is amazing. Once you make it through the whole tour it is a must to go to the top tower behind the city to get the view. It will be a view to remember and help you realize how big the city is. I would also recommend checking out the tea shop on the east corner which is absolutely amazing.
Love to go visit this place. it feels like i am going back in time. you can spend the whole day here to enjoy the chinese spirit.
"There are only four Palace's in the world that I would do anything to see. One of the them is the Forbidden City.

Ever since I was young my passion and dream was to stand inside the Forbidden City. It did not disappoint. People asked me when I got home how was our holiday. I tried to answer them but there is just know way to answer them as there are no words to describe the experience that we had.

Make the trip to China and make the time to go see the Forbidden City. Allow plenty of time to see it as there is so much to see."
"Using the name ""city"" is quite accurate, the place is huge. I spent here all afternoon, walked for hours and im pretty sure I didn't see it all. Is a beautiful place, really well maintained, really crowded, but a key piece on chinese heritage and history. The only thing that surprised me is that Chinese people all around will be spiting in the floor, by now it looks normal so dont be scared. Enjoy the architecture, the colors, the landscapes and touch the golden balls on one of the gates for good luck."
"There is only 1 entrance and it is through the Meridian Gate down by Tiananmen Square. You have to go through the Square to get to the entrance.

I highly recommend seeing this attraction. It is very well taken care of and is almost perfectly preserved. Also I recommend at least 1 person in your group getting the audio guide. You place the headset in your ear and it tells you about what you are looking at. But there is no need to press a button or let it know where you are. I'm not sure it if is GPS or sensors for when it is close to a building. But it is pretty neat walking up to something and having it know what you are looking at, or walking away from that and it stopping.

However, there are a ton of people! They mostly congregate around the Halls in the middle of the complex (Hall of Supreme Harmony, Hall of Middle Harmony, Hall of Preserving Harmony). You cannot go into these but they are open for you to see. But do so knowing you are going to be pushed around and smashed into other people. It is like scooping up a big net of fish, but with cameras and phones in the air. People aren't intentionally pushing you it just happens because of the sheer amount of people. I'm talking 100 people on a platform 10 feet deep are trying to see into a garage sized doorway, get pictures, and not fall of the steps. I wish I were exaggerating, but unfortunately I am not. And now thinking back on it, I braved the crowd and cannot remember seeing anything but other people. So if you are going in, commit and get to the front! This will happen at each temple and only there.

The other areas are not as crowded. I recommend taking your time and looking around these. They are just as beautiful and a lot less crowded because everyone wants to see where the Emperor worked or slept. But the entire place was his and is equally beautiful.

The Imperial Garden is beautiful! You have to go through it to exit so you won't miss it. But leave enough time to see it!

Overall it is a great place to see, just be ready for a lot of people."
"This is one of the most historical places in Beijing. After going through 3 almost identical red buildings, they all kind of looked alike to me. It seems that are red building after red building after red building. The art work inside is okay, but not as exceptional as the museum across the street. I feel that there are more impressive things to see in Beijing. This is not really a place that I would need to see more than once"
amazing place that everyone should visit . only problems ticket lines that can take a lot of time . Forbidden city takes at least a day to visit
"Very old palace, but maintained very well. Rent the electronic guide that costs 40 RMB, completly worth it."
"Great half day spent in Beijing. Be prepared to queue at security if you go mid morning.. It does move though so be patient. It was 60rmb for entry(during peak season).. Make sure to bring identification as they wont let you in without it. I would advise to get the talking audio guide. It's only 40rmb(about 8euro) and as you arrive at each significant part of the palace, you get told the history behind it. I was lucky in that it was a beautiful day when I did the visit and it was such a treat leisurely walking around. I spent about 3 hours in total and covered about half of the palace, although I believe you can do it all in 4 hours. I enjoyed taking me time. There is extra charges of 10rmb (I.50euro) to enter some exhibitions while in the palace like the treasure gallery or the house of clocks but definitely worth the small price! A must do in Beijing."
"We are on a 20 day Grand Circle Tour of China

Chinese tourist do not know or care to stand in any form of a line, thus they are very pushy - You have to learn to push back otherwise you will miss things!

Chinese in general are very noisy with competing tour guides YELLING at their groups (that is how chines talk to one another = In a yell)! Good thing our guide had wireless transmitters to our ear buds, otherwise the overall racket would dive you nuts.

We enter the Forbidden City, so named because it was off limits to visitors for 500 years. Completed in 1420, this was the center of Imperial palaces for the emperors of the Ming and Qing dynasties. The last dynasty fell in 1911, though the last Qing emperor lived here until 1925 when it became a museum.

The movie “The Last Emperor” was filmed in the city and is a “must see” for anyone interested in seeing what we were fortunate to view in our short three hours of visit.

The Forbidden city contains 800 ceremonial buildings, 9,999&1/2 rooms (the Emperor who is suppose to be ½ of a god, should not have as many rooms as the deity god with 10,000 rooms). The courtyard that can hold 100,000 people.

You just have to marvel at its 600 year old grandeur & elegance.
Some of the highlight beyond what you can see in the movie (The Last Emperior):
• The pavement under the entire complex and building is supported with stone blocks first going North and South, then covered with stone blocks going East and west (it is a Forbidden city and they wanted to make sure no one could tunnel in)
• We were able to view into the receiving throne room (over the heads of the zillion Chinese tourist in our fight to the front of the opening.
• Ancient Chinese belief is that everything in the universe is made up of five elements (Fire / Water / Earth / Wood / Gold), and everything we were lucky to see (and hear about by our tour guide) reflected such.
• We spent some time in the area of the last Dowager Princess (the dragon lady) apartment = again you have to see the movie.
• There were no trees allowed in most of the Forbidden city (where an assassin could lurk in as he may want to kill the emperor) with the exception of the garden at the heart of the private area for the Emperor (a most excellent area)."
"From one building to another into another, you carry on into this seemingly unending palace giving historic input of what went on inside the palace from Ming to Qing dynasty. We went with a tour guide, who had adequate knowledge being local with well understandable English & accent.Having seen many palaces in different parts of the world, specially India , Turkey, France, England & Spain, this palace is huge.There is a gallery of the record of what has been going on within this palace.You need good hour or even more to see the place, which is full of local as well as international tourists. A place not to be missed while in Beijing & special treat for history lovers."
This was my 1st stop in China. I suggest getting there as soon as they open; the crowds are DIFFICULT to get through when trying to see the more popular parts of the palace.
I really didn't know much about this fantastic sight before visiting and what a delight it was. Absolutely huge and so much to see. We had a personal guide which helped us understand the history. Make sure you visit the beautiful garden that nicely balanced out all the buildings. Be sure to take along some water as not many shops inside and in the heat easy to become dehydrated.
Very crowded and very hot. Caps definitely recommended. Lots to see. Tourits cannot get very close to some of the exhibits and it's difficult to take pictures. Worth the effort though.
"Amazing impressions when you experience the sheer size of the Forbidden City, you really can feel history. Take a few hours of your time.
If you decide to take a private guide, don´t be surprised if the guide can not answer your questions. Even though as his/her English sounds perfect, the entire guide talk might be completely learned by heart and they don´t speak English at all ;)."
Mind blowing scale and we were pressed for time so need to go back and use a guide. Incredible to believe such scale in the past. Right up there with Angkor Wat as a spectacle. Lots of visitors though!!!
"Just amazing buildings,China doesn't do small, get your walking shoes on and stroll around and soak up the history.Don't forget your passport to buy your tickets."
"If you're looking for a good way to kill a day in Beijing, visit the Forbidden City. Though it is crowded and some people are a little pushy (not the fault of the city itself), it is absolutely worth a visit. Also, try an audio guide, which will help narrate more about the various buildings and temples. There is so much to see and do; it is impossible to visit every site but it is fun to try. I would recommend bringing some food for lunch and water because once you leave the city, you can't return. We spent 6 hours there and the time passed very quickly. Also wear good walking shoes!"
"The Forbidden City is absolutely spectacular and of great historic importance.This is a must see when you visit Beijing but the site is so large that walking through from the entrance to the exit is a long walk and by the time you exit the buildings look very much the same.The Forbidden City, full of history and character! First of all it is a HUGE place (we didn't manage to see everything), so plan on wearing good shoes and be prepared to walk a lot! But it's worth it, just an incredible place with an amazing history!"
"We were near the DENGSHIKOU 燈巿口 station and took a thirty-minute walk to the entrance (午門). It was great to walk around the city at this time of the year as the weather was really nice with sunshine and breeze.
We arrived at the entrance at three thirty. There were lots of tourists around the entrance but not many of them were buying the tickets because the city closes at five that day and the counter will close at 16:10.
Remember to bring your passport or identity card as they will check it before giving you the tickets.
Before entering the forbidden city (紫禁城) you have to pass through the security check just like entering the subway. Immediately after that you can see the counter for renting the tour guide machine which is ¥20.
It's also okay if you don't rent it because there are signs in English and Chinese introducing each building.
We just walk along the central axis of the city to visit the main buildings and the royal park (御花園) , which took us less than an hour to finish. If you have more time you can visit those themed exhibitions located in the buildings at the two sides of the city.
One point to note: They only let visitors to observe the inner decorations through the doors instead of letting you in. There will be a crowd of tourists jamming in front of the door so if you want to take a good photo you have to squeeze through the crowd first. And there are no lightings in the building, you may want to bring your best camera with you for taking photos.
注意事項: 在故宮你只能夠在每個宮殿的門外看裡面的擺設，並不是像其他的景點一像可以走進去參觀。所以門前面就會有一大堆的人，如果想要拍照的話都到要擠過他們才可以拍到照片。記得盡量帶一部好一點的相機因為宮殿裡面都沒有照明，只能靠從門外照進的自然光，如果運氣不好天色比較暗的話就很難拍到漂亮的照片了。"
The place is large and beautiful to remember the History of this city but because we were in travel tour our time is limited. I think next time i will not book in travel tour if your really need to experience the whole beauty of Forbidden-City.
"It's better to have a guide to get the ticket and take your there, we considered it's money well spent when we saw the queue at the ticket office. The complex is huge, and the crowd is even bigger. it was like the whole of Beijing was there. don't be shocked when they queue jump, push shove and get very close to you, especially when they need to use the toilets, a woman tried to get into my cubicle (lock was dodgy) while I was still doing my business. Yike.
You need to get used to the Chinese way, you'd need to do the same, don't be shy.
Remember your hat and sunscreen, it was stinking hot when we were there a few days ago. if you could bring an umbrella it'd be better."
The forbidden city is a site to behold. It covers a vast area and is well maintained. Our third visit and we still enjoyed the visit. One learns something new with each visit.
"This is a must see when you visit Beijing but the site is so large that walking through from the entrance to the exit is a long walk and by the time you exit the buildings look very much the same. Be sure you wear comfortable shoes and clothes.

Changes in building size and height were very important to the emperor but far less important to me. In many cases the buildings were the same except for a few square feet or a bit of height.

Note that the emperor did not actually sleep with his wives for fear that if he slept they would kill him in his sleep. Thus he had a recreation bedroom and a separate building for his sleeping quarters."
"This is a must see while in Beijing and one of my favorite Palaces. It's a ton of walking but well worth the journey. Be ready to get bombarded on the exit by vendors, etc."
You really need a guide for this tour to bring to life the daily lives of the royalty and concubines that resided here. It's an enormous place and may need a good part of the day to soak it all in.
This is a must see while in Beijing. The detail in the artwork/painting on the buildings are amazing. It is hard to believe it was built so long ago. It is a large area so we're comfy shoes
"Great historical location. Many of the buildings were closed but you could look thru the Windows.
A lot of walking. Many people stay close together."
Went there and was amazed by the structure of the buildings. It was like going back to the days when the world is ruled by emperors and sorcerers.
Pay the extra few RMB and enter this place. It is huge and the tulips and trees are incredible! There is a lot of walking so make sure you wear comfy shoes and bring a water. There are lovely spots to take fantastic pictures!
"Pretty much obligatory to visit if you're in Beijing. Nowadays it's a one-way trip, entering from Tiananmen Square and walking north. Bewildering collection of buildings to inspect. Is usually extremely busy with both international and domestic (Chinese) tourists"
"This is not a Museum in the European sense, in that there are few, if any artefacts [there are a few if you seek them out or happen upon them.]

It is not a 'Palace MUSEUM', but a 'PALACE Museum'. A Museum of Palaces. Besides the three main buildings there are the six eastern palaces and six western palaces.

The Forbidden City covers an area of about 72 hectares (178 acres) with a total floor space of approximately 150,000 square meters (1,600,000 square feet). According to Wikipedia, it consists of 90 palaces and courtyards.

It is extremely tiring to walk around and there are no signs directing you to the exit. Hardly any of the staff spoke English, or understood sign language!. It was the worst experience of my four day visit to the City of Beijing.

You can take a guided tour which is quite expensive or just wander around by yourself [or follow the tour at a discrete distance!] I can't remember the entry price but it wasn't much."
"The Forbidden City, full of history and character! First of all it is a HUGE place (we didn't manage to see everything), so plan on wearing good shoes and be prepared to walk a lot! But it's worth it, just an incredible place with an amazing history! It is well signed and conserved, and the price is well worth it.
Can be really crowded (average 80 000 people per day visit the city) but it is so big that you don't really feel it once inside.
Enjoy this mysterious and historical place."
"Forbidden City (故宫) is rightfully one of the main attractions in Beijing, however, the interior of this historical complex felt a bit empty despite being crowded with tourists.

For those worried about tickets, either go early or check tickets (60CNY) on gugong.228.com.cn
There was about a 5 minute wait for tickets at 10AM on a Wednesday afternoon. The queue for security was not too bad despite the hordes of tourists inside. The central area has multiple hallways attracting lots of frenzied tourists all shoving in and out trying to take a picture and flailing their selfie sticks around. Quite a spectacle to see from a distance. If you explore away from the central area you will much less hustle and bustle; however, some areas seemed blocked off. Towards the north side are some interesting rock formations to see.

I was a bit disappointed with what I saw inside; whilst on the outside the place seems very big and grand, inside is quite empty and I didn't really find that many things to see especially given some areas were closed off. And yes, like any famous tourist in China expect to contend with large crowds."
"It was quite crowded on the day we visited. As one does, we entered by the south entrance, walked through the City and left by the north exit. We saw interesting exhibits of Chinese painting and of Fabergé eggs and other items. You get a more panoramic view from the walkways on the walls."
"How grand the emperor's lifestyle was. Now, you'll be able to walk on the emperor's path and see where his concubines resided although you can only look through the windows. Be prepared to do lots of walking but this is a very interesting place to visit. Remember your hat, sunglasses and bottled water and your camera!"
Was a nice walk around the quite large complex. Pay for the audio guide it actually makes the walk more interesting. There is also a risk of learning something about Chinese culture and history ;)
A huge complex that shows the greateness of imperial China. Be prepared for an about 4 hour walk. Come early as the queues are very long. Don't forget your passport!
"Very interesting but can get very crowded. Go early right when it opens. In fact, get there before it opens to stand in line for tickets"
"This is a crowd place, of course, because this is the hugest oldest museum of China, so many history stories here, every one has hundreds years at least.
I love this place, you could feel real old history here, it's worth to go!"
"The palace is vast, and beautifully preserved. The inner sanctum of the King and Queen is smaller than you would imagine, certainly different to palaces in Europe. The scale of the Forbidden City gives some idea of court life, and how isolating it must have been. From the large bronze braziers for heat, sun dials for time, and the garden at the back of the palace, it provides enough imagery to imagine the lifestyle for the sons of heaven for millennia. Best to get a tour director with connections to spirit you past the many touts, and crucially, before the crowd gets there."
"Recommend this attraction. It didn't blow us away, but an amazing feat and pretty well maintained. I'd go with a guide or tour, you'll be lost otherwise I feel."
"You have to do this once in your lifetime! It is huge and covers a vast area....remember the Lost Emperor film - watch the film before you visit and again watch the film after you have visited. Yes you were there.
It is unbelievable.
We spend half a day and could have wandered for longer.
Beware of the pick pockets at the entrance and exit - its really busy but it is not busy inside.
Oh....it has 5* toilets!
A 5* café
They do 5* coffee and 5* ice creams
Bucket list attraction....definitely"
On my bucket list and wonderful to take it all in from Tian 'anmen square through to the North gate.
Amazing beautiful must see in Beijing. It is so big and amazing history. Take an electric Tour which Will take you through the highlights and make sure you walk out on the north to climb up tot the temple for an overview of where you have been!
"It is advisable to engage a guide from Palace Museum.
The place though not as big as I first thought, but it has many rooms for different purpose. One can easily lost their way as direction signage is few.
Engaging a Museum guide, she explained the purpose of the rooms, articles in the palace,history, palace procedure etc.
This is value added, rather than aimlessly go through reading the display and squeeze with crowd, she gave a very clear explanation. We can also ask questions if in doubt. She also advise a good position to take memorable photos.
We are fortunate to get a good guide for the central and west axis for over 2 hours at CNY200."
"Just imagine how grandeur the emperor's lifestyle was. Now, you'll be able to walk on the emperor's path, enter the 2nd gate, where only diplomats were allowed, and 3rd gate where his concubines reside."
Very exciting to see. Lot of walking involved. You will need at two and a half hours. Lot to see. Relate this to the film The last Emperor. Amazing to learn about the dynasty.
"Week ends are crowded, but well worth it. Take your passport with you in order to buy a ticket, and be prepared to do some long walks. All in Chinese, very little English help."
"I was told that you need to get there at about 8am to get tickets to enter because they only allow a certain amount per day. I actually arrived closer to 9.30am and there were still lots of tickets available. To get tickets, walk through the big main entrance gate and keep going until you see a sign that says ""Palace Museum Tickets"", it'll cost you around $12 AUD. Even if there are no tickets available this section still offers lots of photo opportunities. Once you get in through the ticket inspection point you can purchase an ""automatic guide"" (pre-recorded audio tour) for about $10 AUD which is quite informative regarding the history of the temples and other monuments inside. Depending upon how much you want to see, you could take over four hours to see it all, I'd recommend at least having two hours spare plus another half an hour to get transport afterwards, the nearest subway stations are around 1.5km from the exit. I also suggest you bring water, sunscreen and a hat!"
"You can enter only east gate or south gate via tiannanmen sq. Its 60yuan to get in. When you get it it seems repeated things mainy a building with thrones in them v boring. When you hit the forbidden city parts different roads seem to veer off. This is where there is alot of walking. They lead to different areas of sculptures, written , and budda exhibitions inside. Very long place drink loads. Very enjoyable."
"We visited late April at around 12:00 and because we were not in peak season there was no queue to buy tickets and no queue to get in. The only thing we queued for was the audio guide.

However, we were told that everyday they only sell a certain amount tickets and once they have gone its not possible to buy any more, so go as early as possible. Our hotel called them and asked how many tickets were left so that might save you a wasted journey.

Even out of season there were still lots of people inside but it wasn't crazy, Id hate to think what summer would be like.

Its definitely worth the visit and to get an audio guide. Spend at least 3 hours there but more would be needed to explore all parts, its big!

Remember to bring your passport, they wont sell you a ticket without one."
"This is my second visit to the Forbidden city and a total disappointment from 10 years ago.
It seems it is now only a big money making scheme with a lot of thief's hanging out there. Overcharged and we received fraudulent from one of the vendors. Be careful and don't make use of any private taxis or 3wheel Bikes"
The amount of tourists visiting this place is incredible. You need to jostle for space. Our recommendations to take the sights by visiting either the left or right walking route rather than the center.
"An amazing structure considering the history, the audio guide wasn't bad and explained what each building was for. It did mention you need about four hours to do everything and I wish I had had the time to do all of it. We went when it was raining, but armed with an umbrella it was ok. It was still pretty crowded and I wonder if it is worth going very early to avoid this. There are toilets and places to eat here and guided tours available."
"I was fortunate enough to visit on a not-so-busy Sunday and was able to enjoy the extensive garden walk-ways and temples ... a definite bucket-lister if you enjoy history, Chinese history and natural beauty all in one."
"This is a must see Place in Beijing. The forbidden city is really something exceptionally. A lot of buildings and to see in a big area. You need to spend some hours if you want to see it all. Spend time to see all the details and different buidlings on both side of the ""mainstream"" walk."
"Don't forget to bring your passport or identity card when you go here.
There's a lot of people here, so be prepared for long lines for the entrance tickets. However the lines move pretty fast.
It's a bit hard to navigate around the exhibits due to the number of visitors; be prepare to squeeze amongst the crowd just to have a glimpse of the artifacts.
Overall quite an interesting place. Would be excellent if not for the crowd."
Must see and spend more time don't get rushed up by the guide. They tend to finish quickly and take your to pearl and silk factory. That's a true waist of time . Try not to visit on a Sunday as it's crazy crowded. Also must in the night when they have a lighted musical fountain show
Insanely busy so it's a bit hard to enjoy it in the moment. Beautiful architecture and there are nice peaceful places to sit if you stay off the central path.
"We went to see the forbidden city as we had limited time. It simply goes on and on! Unfortunately we didn't have time to enter the museum, but will hopefully do that sometime again. It is a huge complex so be prepared for a long walk if you want to see it all. You also exit at the back of the complex which is a little strange too. Leave at least half a day for this alone if not longer. Easiest way to get here is via the subway to Tianamen east or west and exceptionally cheap too, although West is probably slightly better as there is an exit/entrance on the same side of the road."
"I have done this three times now and thing the wow factor has gone - you really need to go to see this when it is quiet - if you do get a choice about the timing. I went there on possibly the worst day of all (May 1st Holiday) and it was VERY crowded. There were too many people to be able to see into the rooms and all the open courtyards were just bustling with people. Watch your step as well as there are barriers at the gates and you need to step over these - when the place is crowded, you may not see them. One of our small tour group fell over one, cut their leg but fractured the ulna at the elbow - now needs surgery."
"To get the most out of the tour you need to rent audio guide, otherwise do not expect much explanation. With audio the tour takes much longer. So do expect 3+ hours.
Otherwise you can run through the place within 1-1½ hour. Be aware they have some additional exhibitions inside that you need to pay for so it is not one time fee.
Remember to stand inline to purchase your ticket then, stand inline to get access to the palace. Check up if you are choosing Chinese holidays because then it gets extra extra crowded.

Beautiful place, I do recommend this place even when it is touristic."
"Having read and watched documentaries and films, we were disappointed. The buildings are shells and the place was teeming with Chinese tourists taking selfies. It lacked atmosphere."
"Even though the trip to the FORBIDDEN CITY it is very popular but after being there i realise that its not worth the time and effort.

We also rented the audio guide but the entire complex has nothing to offer and indeed disappointing

Its just a series of empty halls and gates having cool sounding names but having same look and content.

A tourist expects much more from a Palace tour about the lifestyle and the things they used in the day to day lives.

You can avoid this tour if you have better things to do."
"Definitely a must-see for any first time visitor to Beijing. I have read & seen the Forbidden City so many times in books, movies, documentaries that to finally visit it was like a dream. The scale & size of the palace is a city on itself. Best to go with a knowledgeable guide who can tell you stories of what happened there. All visitors start at the southern gate at Tiananmen Square and walk through the palace towards the northern gate. There are several throne halls where visitors cannot enter but there is a crush people jostling and shoving (all with smiles on their faces) to take photos of the Dragon Throne and the giant Black Pearl that hangs above it.
An interesting sight are 2 huge copper vats that had their gold-colored paint scrapped off. Our guide explained this was the work of the Eight Allied Armies (Austro-Hungary, Britain, Germany, France, Italy, Japan, Russia & USA) when they occupied Beijing & looted the Forbidden City after the Boxer Rebellion in 1900. Once they realized the vats were not gold they left them alone.
Near the northern end of the palace is the less-known Inner Palace gardens, for the Emperor & his concubines. There is a tower for the concubines to climb up to see the outside world."
"First of all don't forget your passport. Secondly, automatic guide does the job. Gives a lot of interesting information. It's worth to imagine that they made buildings like these when Europe was in the middle ages (beginning of 15th century)."
"You are not alone visiting the forbidden city, but it is one of the must sees in Beijing. Across from Tiananmen square you walk through an impressive gate and come into a maze of courtyards and buildings, and courtyards and more buildings. The visit inspired us to buy the ""last emperor movie"" and we had a lot of ""I've been there moments"".

It is easy to lose the overview of the area, and I recommend going in the adjoining Jingshan Park up the hill to get a nice view of the city."
highly recommanded to visit when you have the chance to visit Beijing. But wear good shoes and take your time.
"We did this as part of a 1 day whirlwind tour around Beijing. Following the wall, this was just an okay experience. It is certainly a very cool architectural design but we became a bit bored with it. Certainly a must do but once you take a few pics it was time to pick up the pace."
"Interesting to see the size of the place. Not much to do or see.
Very very busy, gardens were very beautiful"
"When I was waiting in the museum there was an announcement how beginning in June daily visitors would be limited to 80.000! There is a sea of people one enters this remarkable place with. But like many things in China, you can figure out a way to have private time there.

It's almost overwhelming, but yet not. Do get the headphone walking tour. It's very helpful.

And just enjoy!"
"Magical, went with Andy from SNA tours. Having a local guide made a huge difference, no waiting, informative talk and history. Take a hat, its hot!"
"Just don't miss the Forbidden City. Make sure you have plenty of time though, as it's big. Also, make sure you go to the gardens to the rear of the Forbidden City (on the outside), as there's a lookout that looks over the Forbidden City (great views)."
"Located in the heart of Beijing and officially known as the Palace Museum.It has magnificent architectural complexes and completed in 1420. Twenty four emperors ruled for nearly 500 years. It's a Temple of Heaven and a place where the priest of the temple humbled himself in prayer to guarantee a good harvest. This place is impressive, incredible and amazing and it's huge so allow plenty of time to spend here. You will see locals dancing, playing instruments, people with resumes looking for suitors for themselves or their children. Very interesting place to see."
"There are a lot of people that go through the forbidden city everyday. many are part of tour groups that follow a specific path through the city. These groups do not travel as frequently to the left or right of the main path through the city. there are, in my opinion, better things to see on both sides of the main path through the city. You can loop back and forth to make sure you see everything. The complex is very large but there are many maps located throughout the city that will tell you where you are.

Avoid visiting this view during holidays! While there is some food and drinks sold within this view, i would recommend you bring snacks and water with you. Toilets are conveniently located throughout the Forbidden City. While there a few things to see inside buildings, i would not suggest seeing the forbidden city if raining outside unless you live in Beijing and would like to see it with less people and can easily see it under many different conditions. Like many things in China, arrive early, and you will see less people but this will quickly change from 9:00 - 11:00 (probably will see the biggest crowds). Going during the work week rather than a weekend you should also see less people. Most of all, take your time, there is a lot of history within the forbidden city and is a must see when you go to Beijing.

When exiting the north side of the city, take a visit to Jingshan park (there is a under the road tunnel to the left that will get you across the street to the park). This is worth a visit.
."
"One of the attractions, which must be seen during Your stay in Beijing. I strongly advice to get up early in the morining and be in the tail for tickets at least 30 minut before opening. It will allow You to go inside in the, let's say, first one hundred people :-). It allows for avoiding the crowd inside. After passing gates You can lend electronic guide, basing on GPS signal, so it will be turned on when You arrive to exact attraction in the Forbidden City. Again, to avoid crowd I recommend to go quite fast through first internal squares: just a few photos and go. Then You can enjoy of the calm and quiet area inside the City.
The whole object has two strong advantages: a lot of place on the internal squares - just imagine, especially after visiting overcrowded hutongs, how giant space for the living had the Emperor. The second point are some of the exhibitons inside the complex. I liked especially that with imperial gemstones including giant nephrite, collection of stamps of the imperial administration, and Puyi pavillion. Imperial garden located in the complex was also very impressive.
After exit by the north gate I racommend to go to so called Coal Hill - going uphill You cas admire great views of the Forbidden City and, from a longer distance: modern chinese opera building.
Considering opinions that Forbidden City is somehow disappointing:
1. It is overcrowded. It is true, but for chinese people there is so lot space, that they definitely will not agree. Additionally I described a simple method how to (at least partially) avoid.
2. It is boring. Of course - but if You read a historical context, will go along the high, red walls, will see phoenixes, lions, dragons, etc. on the roofs, will try to see details, the impression of the boring atmosphere will vanish. It may be a little disappointing for people visiting e.g. japanese temples peviously (like Nikko) as ornaments, roofs and sculptures are not as impressive but taken together this place is absolutely worth every yuan spent for a ticket :-).

My time of visit was about 7 hours and I think it is enough time but in a sunny, warm (or hot) day it may be exhausting experience so it would be nice to make some rests during visit. I recommend to reserve all the day for Forbidden City + coal hill (+ evening visit on Tiananmen square)"
"Every day 80.000 people are allowed to visit the Forbidden City, you need to go with a tour guide otherwise you are wandering about a huge place and have no idea what was going on there.
We were a small group and we told the tourguide 2-2,5 hrs max is enough, which was great. At least we know now how things where during the times of the Emperors."
"This is a must of course if you are in Beijing. The hoards of visitors are overwhelming so get there early (8 a.m.) and make sure you have your advance tickets and passport handy. They will sometimes start letting people in before 8:30 a.m. and you can stay about 15 minutes in front of the crowds. See all the central stuff, including the imperial gardens, but make sure to head off to the side palaces and wander the alleys to much less-crowded palaces and temples, many of which are open with free art exhibits. Enter the south gate (meridian gate) and walk through to the northern gate leading to Jingshan Park. Then make a right and head back south down through the west palaces when you will find the 9 Dragon Screen and the palace with all the clocks. It's makes for a great stop not just for the clocks but for the beautiful interior of the palace."
"First of all it is very easy to buy a ticket for the tienamen rather than the imperial palace. There is nothing to see inside tienamen gate so keep an eye for the longest queue. That is the one for the imperial palace. Don't forget your passport.

There is a sign saying that the amount of people attending per day is restricted to 80,000! That gives you an idea of the crowds. We went early in the morning and it was still teeming with people. Chinese people tend to bustle so you definitely have to be in the mood for the forbidden city. there is very little shade so wear a hat. There is a limited range of food so eat before you get there.

While I got an idea of the power and wealth of the emperors from the sheer vastness of the place, the forbidden city left me underwhelmed."
"The Forbidden city was not as one would expect. It's just a series of empty halls , almost identical looking.

Most of the furnishings have been removed. All you see are the buildings which have been rebuilt at different times in the past due to fires (they are wooden buildings).

The palace buildings are huge but I have seen better.

Advise : Go to the forbidden city and rent the audio guide. It will cost less than a tour guide. You don't really need a tour guide anyway."
"Forbidden City is the home to all Qing Emperors. Least expect the ancient Chinese were gifted and organised to build such an impressive city.

The Chinese palace where the Emperor and the royal families stayed. So huge compund that there were the Emperor's residence, Empress's residence, Grand Emperor's resudence, Empress Dowager's residence, Consort residence, Concubines' residences, Princes' residences, Princesses' residences, Imperial Library, Imperial Garden, Morning Assembly Hall, Imperial Kitchen, Servants Quarters etc. All essentials were available within the walls of the Forbidden City. Really Unbelievable.

The rest of the ministers stayed at the fringe of the Forbidden City, which is this day Wangfujing. The lower class (Commoners) stayed far outside the fringe.

Remarkable! Impressive! Must visit when in Beijing.

The 4 most prominent places to be visited
are:
(1) Forbidden City
(2) Summer Palace
(3) Temple of Heaven
(4) Great Wall
If there's still some time to spare can consider Lamma Temple (Former residence of Emperor Yong Zheng before he became the emperor)."
"This place is huge! From the entrance till the end is about 1.57km walk. Be sure to stay hydrated and have a good pair of walking shoes. The entrancee fee is 60cny per person. Please note that there are bag scanners before you enter the gate. They will confiscate any type of spray (in my case is my sunblock spray spf 110, so sad..). Any flammable spray is a no no according to them. Getting there, take the subway and get off at Tian'anmen East station. There are scanners there too after you walk out from the station."
"Tons to see, but be ready to walk! The area inside the gate is huge. And the English names on the maps and audio guide aren't the same so sometimes navigation is challenging. I also didn't see an option for a ""through ticket"" at the main gate so I was disappointed when there were areas I couldn't see without buying an additional ticket. But I know why it's a UNESCO World Heritage site and I wouldn't skip over it."
We visited the Forbidden City in August. The front was very crowded and took about 45 minutes to buy the tickets (150RMB) and get into the palace. Bring an old student ID. They don't really check them and you get in for half price. The palace was nice and much larger than I expected. Be prepared to walk for 1-2 hours (there is no roof so bring an umbrella or a hat).
"We went here as part of a private tour therefore can not really comment on queues or costs. Overall very interesting, beautiful and fascinating but very very busy. Making it hard to want to stay there for long and explore."
Try your best to go early and with a local guide to help you get the most of all the art and history nested in this amazing place.
"We had the privilege of visiting the Forbidden City twice during our last visit to Beijing and each time with a different (personal) guide. The first guide took us through the Central Axis of the Forbidden City, viewing the Meridien Gate, Gate of Supreme Harmony, Hall of Supreme Harmony, Palace of Heavenly Purity, Imperial Garden and finally exiting at the Gate of Divine Might. Apparently, this is the recommended route for those visitors who wish to see the Forbidden City within limited time. This route took us alittle under 2 hours to complete.

Our second trip (a week later) was totally different. Our second guide (Amber) showed us around the quieter and less explored areas of the city, to name a few - the Southern Three Places, Hall of Joyful Longevity and etc. Also, Amber was very excited to show us some very interesting exhibitions inside the Forbidden City such as the collaboration project between the Palace Museum and Virginia Museum of Fine Arts and etc. Amber was very good at getting around the complex, saving us time and helping us avoid the crowds. This time we spent approximately 4 hours in the Forbidden City and totally loved it."
"It is a grand palace. Amazing structure. However, be ready to be trampled by tourists. It's about 2 km from Wangfujing area. You could walk there."
"The Forbidden City is a must-see attraction in Beijing. It can be very crowded though, so arrive as early as you can't. Don't miss the section at the back where you can get lost amongst the buildings."
"A very wonderful palace with lots of great structures, a place where you need to go and see how great the Chinese empire. The Forbidden City is inside beijing like the Vatican in room. You got to go and take pictures in it."
Gives you a glimpse of Chinese history and lifestyle of the rulers. Lots of walking tho. Give yourself 2 to 3 hours.
"The Imperial palace is built delicately and gracefully, with an imposing magnificence.It is a centralized indication of ancient architectural art with red walls.It is convenient for you to rent an electronic tour guide.The price is 5 dollars.You can visit from the Meridian Gate and leaves at the Gate of Godly Prowess.After seeing that, you can pay 2dollars to have a look at the Jingshan Park on the opposite.The scenery at the top of the mountain is very beautiful.The ticket of Imperial Palace is 6 dollars in low season and 9 dollars in high season."
Forbidden city of China is pretty great. There are many historical treasures. People visiting there everyday maybe so many. I feel a bit crowded.
"The Forbidden City is huge. I was not prepared for how huge it is. The Emperor kept the Forbidden City for his family and concubines. It was forbidden to everyone else. The place is huge, with approximately 26 courtyards and separate ""palaces"". Really interesting history there!"
"A very impressive place loaded with history. Be aware that the flow of the visit is one way in order to handle the significant crowd at the entrance. If you are on your own, try to find a guide close to ticket office. He will arrange fast tickets an accelerated entrance. Due to high demand, visitors are allowed only once so ensure you allow sufficient time on the same day"
I love this place and it is must see despite the fact that the Chinese don't seem very good at preserving antiquity
Amazing place but it's hard to enjoy with the crowds of people. They limit the tickets per day but not the times you can go in unfortunately. The imperial gardens turned into a lunch and sitting spot for all and lost its appeal and what felt like it should have been a peaceful get away for the emperors of the time.
"Amazing place, much larger than I had expected. Lots of walking but worth every step. Wonderful architecture and landscaping. Very busy with lots of people but not a problem in such a large area. 2-3 hours needed to see everything."
Very interesting place to be. Take a tour guide if you want to spend your time the most efficient way. So much to learn about the Chinese palace plot ! Loved the imperial garden & the dragon ladies room !
"Know the significance of this site before visiting in order to fully appreciate it! Of all the things we did in Beijing, I was surprised to hear my tween son say that this was his favorite part of the trip, with the Great Wall a close second."
Despite of being so big that we are not able to see everything if you are in Beijing you should not miss that. You can not go inside the bildings but just walking around that great place worth the visit. Don't miss it.
Your Beijing trip is not complete without a visit to the forbidden city . Its more than 600 years old and it's always better to take a guide along with you since this place has a lot of history .we were luck to get an English speaking guide . she was very friendly and will tell you the all the important facts about the place .You can contact her in China art international travel service CO. Ltd.
"The Forbidden city was so interesting, I really loved the garden, especially the ancient grotesque trees and rocks."
Can be quite packed during spring time. Best to go during the autumn to take in all the sights with less people around.
"The forbidden city is huge, who would have thunk it. If you've seen the animated movie Mulan then you'll recognize this place from the movie. There's so much history here with the different dynasties and emperors that lived here. Very interesting stuff. Make sure this is on your list for places to see."
"Be prepared to walk, and walk, and walk as uou pass through multiple gates and walk across many expansive courtyards. Go with a guide who can give you the history and stories about the Forbidden city. Before you go watch the movie ""The Last Emporer so you have some idea about the stucture and culture in the Forbidden city. It is a one-way walk, so if you are on your own, know that you will come out far from where you started."
You will be shocked by the size and the history of this place. we have never seen anything like it before. Get an official guide with you as you would be able to jump the line as foreign tourist. very busy place but worth the visit.
"One of the most magnificent structures and complexes I have ever seen. The Forbidden City complex is simply a must see if one is visiting Beijing. One can only imagine what life was like within the City walls, but a visit will bring you closer to that understanding.

I recommend going early in the day to avoid the crowds as much as possible for this is a must see for not only foreign tourists but Chinese tourists as well. Parking is all but impossible, so be sure to arrange drop off and pick up transportation, book a tour with transportation or use a taxi."
"I went solo on a Tuesday. The palace is a vast complex and it would probably take a whole day to cover it in detail. Entrance is 60 Yuan and you have to take valid ID to get a entrance ticket.
Once inside there are other attractions which you have to get additional tickets to get in. I went to the treasure chamber and it took me on a alternate route. I would recommend travelers to use this as the main route is packed with local tourists. (Basically you have to squeeze your self to get a view of any of the chambers). It was worth the experience and you get to see the artifacts and treasures of the Chinese dynasties.
The exit is on the other side of the complex. (Once you get in you can't get out from the place you entered). You can get a bus from there but I walked back to the square. The walkway is shady and there are a lot of shops on the side of the road. It is interesting to see.
Not sure I'll go there again but you should do it at least once."
"A vast complex of palaces started in the 15th century that remained the imperial residence for almost 500 years. Great squares and a labyrinth of passages leading to intimate courtyards and gardens. Best to take a guide as stories, nuances and anecdotes around every corner. Awe inspiring and fascinating."
"My morning meeting in Beijing was canceled and my host arranged for a work associate to give me a guided tour of the Forbidden City. This is a fabulous, historic site, something everyone should see, especially if you can see it with a guide.

In summary, there more walking and it takes longer than you think. There's lots to see. I needed to buy tickets 3 times. I needed to show my ID twice. A passport is expected. I was able to use a photo of my passport from my mobile phone. You can buy snacks and drinks along the way. There's a long involved story here; if you visit without a guide, you'll miss the point... get a guide!

My visit started at the Qianmen station at the Southern end of Tiananmen Square and ended at the top of the steep hill in Jingshan Park. This is the front-to-back, South to North, direction that all visits must follow.

Tiananmen Square. We found a security gate near the Southwest corner of Tiananmen Square, passed the security check point and crossed the street onto the square. We saw the The Mausoleum of Mao Zedong, The People's Heros Cenotaph monument, and the Tiananmen Square flagpole. The square was very crowded and some people were here just to visit the square. My guide and I, we crossed under the street and entered the Imperial City.

Tiananmen (Gate of Heavenly Peace) is the name of the front gate to the Imperial City. This is a famous gate that we see on TV all the time. It has a picture of Chairman Mao on it. We bought tickets and went upstairs and toured the inside of the building. Very nice.

Palace Museum. We continued North, buying tickets again. These tickets were called Palace Museum Tickets. We crossing through the Meridian Gate (Wumen); we formally entered the Forbidden City. We continued to walk North and we came to the famous Hall of Supreme Harmony (Taihedian). This is most important building. It was crowded, hard to take pictures but this was the key spot.

Heavenly Purity. Continuing North, we passed through another gate, Heavenly Purity Gate (Qianqingmen), and saw additional historic buildings: Palace of Heavenly Purity (Qianqinggong), Palace of Earthly Tranquility (Kunninggong), which then connected to a whole series of palaces that were family living areas. My guide told wonderful stories about the buildings, the emperor, his wife and family.

Gardens. We then went for a walk through the Imperial Garden and following the flow of the people made our way out of the Imperial City through the Gate of Divine Might on the North side.

Jingshan Park. From there, we crossed the street (bought another ticket) and enjoyed a relaxing walk through Jingshan Park. We followed the somewhat steep trail to the top of the hill where we got a beautiful view of the Imperial City through-which we just walked. The walk was difficult, but the view was worth it.

From here, we competed with a whole bunch of other tourists for a taxi and made out way back to the hotel.

Overall about a 3 hour visit. Very historic, very beautiful -- made perfect by my work associate / guide -- a special thanks to her!!

I would surmise that most of the visitors where people from China, perhaps visiting for the first times in their lives. People like me from overseas were welcome, but not as numerous. Remember: you must start at Tiananmen Square and bring your ID and some cash to buy tickets."
A must see in Beijing. Better to visit during weekdays. Do visit the east and west chambers besides the main attractions.
"Visit organised by our Chinese tour guide Becky.

Great insight was provided around the history and traditions of the Forbidden city.

The place was packed however it didn't hinder our movement. In fact to be amongst the patriotism of the Chinese on their visit was an honour. They are such gentle and happy people.

The buildings and history at this place were amazing and a must see for the first time Beijing visitor."
"It was a cool cloudy day and we were on a trip a deal tour, we came here after walking through Tiananmen Square. We felt out guide spent way too long on the first few large courtyards and not enough time in the smaller more interesting inner courtyards. Very glad we came here interesting place."
"The Forbidden City, also called the Imperial Palace or the Palace Museum is comprised of 800 buildings with more than 9,000 rooms. This is so large I don't know how to appropriately describe it. We spent about 2 hours here and still did not see it in it's entirety although we were able to cover a good portion of it. This is unbelievably impressive from the moment you step inside. If not for the history or the architecture then for the ornate grandeur. This is an absolute must see and should be scheduled into any Beijing visit."
Size is overwhelming. Very educational. Many signs were in English so one could learn about the history if you were interested. Wear your walking shoes. If you are a visitor to China you need to show your passport to get in to the grounds.
"The architecture, history and buildings are truly amazing and a must see item on any visitor to Beijing's list.

Spend the money and get the self guided tour headset. This clearly explains the city, the buildings and the used of the areas.

Be prepared for a huge crowd and be prepared to be elbowed and pushed out of the way by little Chinese ladies. They are rude, ignorant and will push you over to get in front of you and to take their photos. They only do it to westerners, SO when in Rome, push back. I bowled many a little old beastie out of my way (not hard, just don't be afraid to jostle them back).

Only disappointment was, each building cannot be entered and are empty of main furnishings. After 3 weeks of places, temples and tombs in Vietnam, where full access is allowed and the furnishings are amazing, the Forbidden city was a let down in this area."
"Our tour guide Serah was great, she was very helpful in explaining many of the features and exhibits during our tour. Her English was excellent and she very patient with our questions and our preferences. I would recommend her for other tour groups.

Visited May 05 2016"
"This is a review regarding the Forbidden City as a whole, not just the Palace Museum.

Crowded tho it is, especially during the weekend we were there, it is still worth it to visit the Forbidden City and see the grandeur of old Chinese architecture & art.

Restoration work had been done on most of the buildings so they look so wonderful and colorful.

In spring time the gardens also looks beautiful with colorful flowers blooming.

A note on souvenir sold in the official shops inside the Forbidden City:
Our guide mentioned that these souvenirs are exclusively sold here only, and she was right, we could not find anything like it anywhere else."
"We visited The Forbidden City on the first day of the Chinese Congress. It was super busy! We were thankful that we had a guide who explained the rich and depth of history of this beautiful landmark that is clearly a jewel of Beijing. I felt that we barely scratched the surface of the place as the grounds are huge! Nice to walk where royalty walked at one time. Take your time to enjoy the facility.

A Tip: Unless the handicap bathrooms are available--this would be a squatty potty experience of the ladies. Be prepared. Bring your own toilet paper.

Another Tip: You are walking on uneven ground throughout the entire experience. Make sure that you are prepared for this.

Still Another Tip: With our tour group, we needed to have our passports in order to receive tickets to get in. Please make sure you have your passport with you."
"Got there at 8.20am, it was packed! Waited 15 minutes for tickets, went through with the crowds. Once you get away from the main temples, the place is so large you can find peace and quiet. Treasure museum and clocks hall (on right from entrance) were worth the ticket price. Exit via the east gate. Beware cycle rickshaw drives who will rip you off and not take you back to Tianmen Square. A Beijing must!"
"This place blew me away. I recalled it from school but was unprepared for how amazing it is inside. What craftsmanship they had already thousands of years ago. It's inspiring. A must visit for any age. Note, some folks in my travel group were on canes or wheelchair bound. It is accessible but everyone must be prepared - it's huge. If you have a disability you can get around but you may not be able to see some of the locations up close. It won't take away from the experience, trust me. Even if you're not a history buff this place is worth visiting. Remarkable!"
"No. 1, get a guide, No. 2, wear really comfortable walking shoes, this place is way bigger than I ever dreamed. So much to see and you would really miss out if you didn't have a guide. I recommend a personal guide or get the headphones. Be prepared to be bombarded with may tour groups and some guides use microphones which is hard to hear over all the people there. There are so many buildings and each has a purpose, there is a building for every event that an Emperor had to deal with, And many rules for the people that enter the City. For example if you are accepted as a concubine you are never allowed to see any of your family again, and when you have children with the emperor, the mother is not allowed to see the child. heartbreaking on both counts. All of the history and idiosyncrasies are very interesting, again, get a guide. The good part is all the traffic flows in one direction, you should have driver meet you at the end, its very far away from the entrance. it is truly amazing the foresight they had in planning over 1000 years ago, and all he details that were attended to. This is a must see. Be prepared for some serious pushing when looking at some of the buildings with furniture in them, otherwise I found the tourists to be quite courteous. Bring water and comfy shoes and enjoy!"
This is one popular site! I'm not entirely sure why the locals like it so much. It seems that there are a lot of tour groups from other parts of China as well. It's very impressive although crowded. Go early in the day!
"The Forbidden City is right in the centre of Beijing and consequently is always very busy.
To walk right through from one gate to the other is about 2km.
However the walk is worth-while but you need a good guide to get you through.Again China Link came up trumps"
Had 1 day in Beijing and decided this was the sight I was going to see. We arrived early shortly after opening and even then it was crowded. There were no clear signs indicating where to get tickets and there seemed to be various queues. Some I think went to parks and other attractions but it was very confusing. There were buses coming in and the bus guides pushed other people out of the way for their group to get through. In the end we didn't go in as it was too busy and would have just been in 1 long queue from start to finish. Would advise getting some local knowledge of when is best time to go or go as part of a tour.
"Tony at china international travel service made this experience go from average to exceptional. The palace sells a limited number of tickets per day, but there is plenty to see there and in the nearby gardens. Having an excellent tour guide helped by explaining what we were seeing and the significance and history of items that seemed small and insignificant."
"Lots of temples and gardens, I think it is a must historic visit to Beijing.
Make sure to get the audio-guide, really well explained.."
"It was interesting learning about the Forbidden City and why it exsisted. Very long walk so be prepared. It warm weather umbrella for shade good option. Ensure you take water & some food snacks as u can't purchase anything once your in City.
Amazing history and if you have a tour guide you learn so much."
"One of my all time to-do excursions, I completed this as part of my two/three week tour of China. I was blown away."
"You cannot visit Beijing without touring the Forbidden City. It is easy to get to and very popular. Weekends can bring hundreds of tourists, so plan on large crowds. In order to give this attraction the attention it deserves, plan on spending a minimum of 2 to 3 hours. Some of the rooms are dark or poorly lit. There are guided explanations in some areas (in Chinese).

Caution on exiting the area. Many commercial tourist traps just outside the city exit. Also, many people begging for money. Some taxi drivers will not take foreigners very far, so plan on negotiating for this.

Overall, you will have a delightful time experiencing this cultural treasure."
"Young and old rushing to view the emperor throne, admission at RMB 60, please buy ticket from booth to avoid being cheated, the palace that captures so many stories and the place that carries so many histories."
I never thought that this place was so huge and beautiful! Highly recommend if you are in Beijing for few days. It is a must! U China Travel gave us a superb experience once we were there! Be ready to walk a lot...wear a nice walking shoes!!
The Forbidden City is a must see. It is not for the feint hearted (good walking shoes required) Once you are in you have to complete the tour which takes a couple of hours but well woth the cultural experience.
"It's a long walk from the entry to the Forbidden City to the exit at the rear. So be well prepared with good footwear and nourishment. There are plenty of spots to sit-down, rest weary legs and contemplate the majesty and history contained within the City's wall. Plenty of nooks and crannies each with its own piece of history and right at the end are the fabulous gardens. It really is a succession of temples and artefacts that are well worth seeing. As with all things in Beijing security is very tight but reasonable. The walk back to the hotel was thoroughly enjoyable taking you through street after street of food and gift shops and noodle restaurants."
"I think you have to come here when in Beijing. It's worth the hype, so it's definitely worth going to! Get there early to avoid the crowds, and buy a ticket for all the attractions within the city, as they're the best bits!"
"It is one of those places you should visit when you're in Beijing I ugess. But I prefer just the view from it at the park in the back of the Forbidde city, than walking through it. It is soooo crowded and I didnt see much than empty houses and buildings. Maybe I took the wrong walkway?"
"It is a sprawling city within the city. A series of courtyards and huge palatial buildings designed and created for different purposes by the elites. These are for entertainment, sports, worship, celebration and amusement of the high and powerful aristocracy. Common men and women were denied entry in these exclusive environments hence the name. Now it is open to all. Be prepared to take long walks and spend at least one day to explore the city."
We had a wonderful day trip with Oceania Cruises to the Forbidden City. It was amazing. We really enjoyed ourself.
"We had a private tour of the City and got all of the history we could ever ask for which was very interesting. However there is nothing special about the city. You have to enter through 3 consecutive buildings before you get to the real entrance. After that you see a series of ""special"" buildings, sculptures, artifacts and courtyards which are all basically the same design. All of sudden you have to exit through the gardens. You can't enter any of the buildings and you have to take your life into your hands for a quick glimpse into the rooms through the open doors or windows because of the crowds and the fact that the Chinese do not believe in given anyone any space and if you give an inch you will find yourself 20 feet away from where you want to be. I realize that this site is very special to the Chinese people but I have to admit that my wife and I were not impressed. 70% of the city is closed off and much of what is open has not been kept up all that well either. Oh by the way there is a certified 4 star washroom (big sign that states this fact) just before you get to the real entrance."
"We were there on a weekday and had heard about the crowds, so decided to get there early. We were in line for our tickets at around 7:40 am. We had perhaps a dozen in the line ahead of us (there are many, many queues). When the ticket counter opened at 8:30, we were in the forbidden city within 10 minutes. You need your passport to buy a ticket.

This place is extensive and we had less than 2 hours because of our schedule. We were able to see everything along the main axis without rushing too much. A few more hours would have given us time to do more exploring, but we were just happy to have seen it at all.

This place is awe inspiring. It is a must see.

Take the time to visit the park across from the north exit and climb to the temple at the top of the hill. The views are amazing."
Make sure you do it. I wrote a lengthy review about the bike tour and do not plan to go into detail here. Do it!
"There is one word about the Forbidden city and that would be wow.
From the moment you walk in you can't help but be in awe of the sight in front of you.
Building after building of amazingly intriguing architecture.

You could easily spend several hours just looking around. I would recommend employing a guide as they can then explain and guide you around this massive place.

It was lovely to see several people dressed up in local dress.

This place can get extremely busy so go prepared and take some water with you.

There is a gift shop.

Well worth visiting at least once in your lifetime"
"Some reviews are complaining that not all of the buildings are open. I prefer to focus on what is open. I walked around for 5 hours and maybe saw one-third of what was available. I was blown away by all that I learned. I used both the audio guide (you can rent them in many languages for about $8) and the signs on the displays - most of them included English as well as Chinese.

You will run into many large tour groups, but they tend to stay in the center of the City, so you can get a break from them if you explore the smaller palaces and building to the East and West. I also ran across lots of school groups. For me, meeting so many Chinese people (VERY friendly!) was a big part of the experience.

Eat a hearty breakfast before you go or bring some snacks. Also - you'll need to bring a passport to buy a ticket if you are not a Chinese citizen."
First of May 2016 a holiday for China and has been crowded. Check and cue. Get in via main gate for the entrance building get tickets on the right side leave your bag and walk back to see the building after it you can pick your back and walk to forbidden city after getting a new ticket on the left side at the palace. Exit on left of right side.
"I loved my time here - yet I am a lover or history and had read up about the history before arriving in China. So when I walked in (through the 3 massive entrances that is) it blew my mind
There was a lot of pushing going on with everyone trying to take photos of where the Emperor's throne room - they might be better off creating a line with security that everyone lines up to view and take a photo then move on
I did come to understand that some Chinese people dream of seeing this place before they die so it is very special for them
It wasn't so much every room that you go into it was our tour guide that told us all the stories about what Royal life was like in the Forbidden city that made the experience real for us - as opposed to a massive palace with massive courtyards
Read up before you head here so you at least have the basics under your belt to help you appreciate it when you arrive :)
I suppose that goes for every historical site you visit
Enjoy!"
"We had half a day after a business meeting but it was surely worth the trip. Hours aren't available after 5 so plan ahead. It's not expensive but you do get nickled and dimed for any special areas. Amazing facility, clean. Good time."
Here you can see the olden culture of King dynasty very good place for historical and architectural lovers and to take photos
Did the Forbidden City using the Lonely Planet guide's recommended walking tour. Really a great experience.
Great history of China. A must see. Amazing architecture. A place for families and friends. Great place for educational purposes
My husband and I have visited the Forbidden city many times and it never fails to overawe. A must see when in Beijing.
"Lying at the city center and called Gu Gong in Chinese, it was the imperial palace for twenty-four emperors during the Ming and Qing dynasties. It was first built throughout 14 years during the reign of Emperor Chengzu in the Ming Dynasty (1368-1644). Ancient Chinese Astronomers believed that the Purple Star (Polaris) was in the center of heaven and the Heavenly Emperor lived in the Purple Palace. The Palace for the emperor on earth was so called the Purple City. It was forbidden to enter without special permission of the emperor. Hence its name 'The Purple Forbidden City', usually 'The Forbidden City'."
"Despite it been freezing, this place was rammed. The queues were quite long and once you were in, it was quite a vast expanse of space.

I mean, I don't want to come across as not appreciating the Chinese architecture, but our view of this was just a bit 'meh'. That said, we were not in a very cultural mood, and honestly, just wanted to go for a bit of a booze-up.

At one point, we did feel like celebs as these two Chinese ladies came up and wanted a picture with us - that was quite cool.

Word of warning though, if you're clearly western you will get a number of Chinese people coming up to you, asking if you want to go for a coffee so they can practise English with you. This is apparently a common scam, as they'll leave you to pay their bill. Just watch out for this."
"Right now, 2016, a lot is closed off as they try to spruce everything up for the 2020 Olympics. The outsides of the buildings are interesting, not much to see inside however. Worth going, walk around, but be prepared to huge crowds straining to see not much of interest by peering through the windows of the major buildings."
"I know I should be saying how great the Forbidden Palace is but, honestly, after 10 minutes it all looks much the same.

It's one of this things you have to do in Beijing but I left feeling pretty under whelmed"
"I really enjoyed spending a few hours here solo. The area is full of history and many different places and building to see, it's really almost like a big maze. Forbidden city is great for solo travelers as well as friends/families. If you like history you can either rent a private guide, audio guide or read all the signs with information throughout the palaces depending on your budget and time. I'd recommend to use some kind of map or navigation as it's easy to get lost and confused in there and miss out on great buildings.

Inside you can find small places to buy water or snacks. You won't find too many toilet areas so plan accordingly! ;)

When leaving, as most places in Beijing, it's great to have you're private shuttle, an Uber (mobile app) etc as it might be tricky to find a taxi!"
These palaces seem to be all the same. They served similar purpose but the story behind where and why they were built are worth knowing. It give a better understanding of what your visiting.
"In short... three huge halls with a throne in each with hundreds of Chinese pushing like MAD to get a picture of a musty, dirty, dark rooms... the garden is more massive rocks than garden... all the statues (the few there were) were massively corroded and only polished were grubby hands had rubbed them.

Most of the city has been rebuilt and is woeful compared to the splendor the place would have had in history.

Be prepared to buy more tickets inside to see some of the badly lit rooms on the sides. The items in the shops were sub standard to those in the street vendors.

If you're looking for a day of hot sweaty, squashed people spitting and taking really weird selfies next to wall after wall... and asking yourself ""Are we in the right place?"" more than once ~ This is perfect for you.

Time would be better spent anywhere else in China. Don't waste a day coming here."
"I was expecting more. It seemed that everything was padlocked up. There were a few big buildings with just a few furnishings in there and crazy crowds of people shoving each other to get a pic on their selfie stick.

Take this day and spend it on another part of the Great Wall rather than going to this."
Excellent value for money for the ticket price. A lot to see and admire. Do not skip treasury gallery as it offers a lot to see and usually not very busy unlike other parts.
"Such a large space, and some of it still hasn't been opened to the public! The architecture is nice at first, but gets a little repetitive towards the end. Allow several hours to walk through, because once you're in, it's hard to find where to get out except at the other end! The garden at the end is well worth the walk! Stunning and relaxing. Good for people watching."
"The most enjoyment and interest I got from the forbidden city is to see the soldiers standing strait asking not to pic them and to see the tourists taking pictures of every inch of the place. To watch the tourists going around and looking for interest to feel they didn't spend their mony was really fun to me. The cost of 60 RNB to the enterence dosnt worth it.
Remember you do HAVE TO do enything in China unless it is really interesting you.
If you are interested making a resurch in anthropology of the tourisem and to understand what drives tourist to make decisions it is the right place."
"Glad I had a guide for this. She knew way more than I would have gotten if I just wandered around here alone. The signage wasn't nearly as good as Temple of Heaven. The place was packed, but everyone really moved in the same flow, so it wasn't so bad (and I hate crowds). With all the people, it's hard to get a sense of how it would have been with just the emperor and immediate staff / family.

Another bucket list item in Beijing."
"Architecture wonder of China. Such a large place. Spent three hours in the city, still only saw a little bit of the palace. Did not visit the many auxiliary buildings.
In the summer should bring an umbrella and wear something cool. Need to be mobile, although wheel chair is available for rent.
Good to visit the place with tour - can get to the head of the queue."
"Adult nephews and niece visiting - Forbidden City always near top of list to visit! Was a bit crowded, but manageable especially for those not used to crowds at Chinese major tourist sites. Only difficulty is getting to the doorway to see the inside of each Hall and being able to read the descriptive signs.
Biggest decision is to walk the entire Forbidden City (down one side and back the other and all the side gardens and buildings) or just walk down the center, seeing all the Halls and then leave via the back entrance (facing Coal Hill). I suggest the entire Forbidden City as you never know what may be on display in one of the side buildings or what might be in bloom in one of the gardens. Peonies and trees in bloom this time of year provided a wonderful fragrance in the air.
Forbidden City is truly a national treasure and all visitors, particularly those interested in history, should place it on the ""must see"" when visiting China!"
"Just wandering around and seeing all the amazing architecture, different spaces, terraces etc an amazing place."
"It is hard to imagine a man, an Emperor, who had to show his power by putting a wall around his city and forbidding others into his world."
The forbidden palace is a must see when visiting Beijing. The architecture and history behind it captures the imagination of what life was like inside the city walls all those years ago. The only hindrance is the mass population of tourists (including myself). I would recommend going as early as possible to beat the crowds!
"We visited on a Wednesday, it was very busy but quieter Han at weekends.
You need some id when buying your entry ticket. You need to allow at least 3 hours plus and be prepared to walk, it's a vast area.
A must see whilst in Beijing."
This a wonderful place to visit. It seems to go on forever. So many different buildings of all sizes. Everything is very balanced. .. semetrical I guess. ..
We went without a guide and wandered the forbidden city. It was a crowded Saturday but still easy to navigate through the crowds. Definitely check out the beautiful imperial garden!
"It is now called the Palace Museum, one of 6 UNESCO World Heritage Sites in Beijing. You could stroll around the Forbidden City from Tiananmen Square to Shichahai Lakes."
"The crowds can wear you out. Tour after tour, tons of kids and groups just make seeing and hearing difficult. We had great weather so the turn out on that day was overwhelming"
"The Forbidden City is another of the must see places when visiting Beijing. The visitor must know that it is huge. Be prepared to meet lots of local and international tourists, all of them taking pictures. Very well kept Chinese arquitecture."
"The Forbidden Palace looked absolutely resplendent, rich in history and grandeur. We opted for an 'official' tour guides instead of the independent guides offering their services near the entrance and it was worth every penny.

Our tour of the site lasted approximately three hours but it could've easily been a lot longer. A 'must see' attraction in Beijing, along with the Great Wall. Visit earlier in the day to avoid large tour groups."
"It's even better than the travel books portray, such an impressive set of beautiful old buildings. Of course it's full of (mostly Chinese) tourists being led by guides carrying flags or umbrellas, but it's big enough to absorb them all. It is however really not suitable for anyone with a disability - the Chinese idea of disabled access is that it should be wide enough for someone to carry your wheelchair up the stairs."
"Hugeeeeeeeee compound. Takes around 3-4 hours to truly appreciate everything this site has to offer. Full of beautiful architecture and loads of local tourist from all over china.
Wear comfortable shoes and make sure you eat before because there isnt much in terms of food inside the Forbidden city only beverages."
"A must while visiting Beijing. Be prepared for lots and lots of people. If you can, hire a guided tour before hand; this will guarantee you have entrance tickets (there is a daily limit) and save you time at the entrance queue. Wear confortable shoes and have patience while trying to see the main attractions."
"Beautiful, amazing, awesome, stunning and impressive. We just loved it, especially having not long ago seen the film, Last Empreror. Only draw back to the wonderful afternoon was just how incredibly busy it was when we visited. It didn't spoil our enjoyment but it did make seeing some of the main attractions really difficult.
Some very quiet areas if you pick them carefully and great history which was well explained by our excellent tour guide."
"it was a pleassure to discover the forbidden city. i finally meet my king here, hahah just kidding. well as soon you enter this place your ayes automatically wide open >.< . can you imagine how can the previous years people can made palace like this . i guess i;ve spend two hours here. worth it to discover this place. i also had a chance to saw the sitting place of the king who called 'maharaja' in malay language . you can also take a picture here by wear the king emperor dress and you can started imagine like you're the mighty king . huahahahah . well thats all i can say . you better come by yourself and conquer this place . rumors said that when you passed the doors you must touch the kinda ball golden looked. chinese said you will lived longer . ehhehe , i've tried it /"
It took us 3 hours to get from one end to the other because we had our mouths open in amazement the whole way through. heaps of little museum/gift shops to look in along the way also. Even if you don't like architecture you will love visiting here. You can get through it much quicker if you want but i suggest leaving yourself plenty of time to explore.
"Oh my goodness, if you walk slowly, it took you 1 or 2 days there just to explore the Chinese history. I would recon this is first stop to study the history. From front door to the end, it might takes you half day just walking through. my follow friend said to me, it's very good exercise back to old time, you don't need to go to gym. ha, it explains why people in old ages are more slim. can't image how many servants the emperor had before, what a large place~~ I would say well-maintained for this architecture. I believe every piece that builds in this place has a story. you just can't image how long it would be. Very impressive history and place to visit."
"The Forbidden City was absolutely beautiful! So much history. We went without our own tour guide, but was approached by one that we agreed to go into the Forbidden City with. Big mistake. I liked the information he provided us, but like most tour guides he tried to take us to buy tea and ancient scrolls and was very pushy. We wanted to see the Forbidden City without wasting time on the extra stuff tour guides normally waste your time with. I'd recommend doing your own research and visiting the Forbidden City by yourself. We visited in November and the visibility was not good, but The Forbidden City, its architecture and gardens were absolutely amazing and a must see sight with so much Chinese history."
"The site is very large and the architecture is amazing. Everywhere you look, it's beautiful. There is a lot of walking and stairs up and down and up and down. There were throngs of people, mostly locals, walking through. It is certainly worth going."
Visiting the Forbidden City is really an amazing experience. It is quite well preserved and beautiful. To see the classical Chinese architecture from imperial time is really a great experience.
"It was good to see but you cannot step inside any of the structures, and the crowds make it difficult to get close to the doors to look inside. Lama Temple is better in my opinion. Worth a look anyway but the gardens around the sides and at the north end were the best bits. Beautiful small structures, statues and interestingly twisted trees with a leafy canopy. Plenty of seating to have a rest after the walk through the extensive courtyards of the forbidden city."
This was the second time I visited in Four Years. It is so large and well maintained that one can learn something new every time. Seniors pay only half price; prove it by your passport. This makes it an inexpensive day. Beware of the taxi drivers at the exit end. They refuse to use the meter but it you insist with enough of them you will win in the end. The park near the end is beautiful and the have refreshments for sale.
"Visit to the Forbidden City is a must if you come to China and the most fulfilling experience for me for a visit to any historical site. It is a big place with a lot of art and historical effects from the times when the palace was used by the emperors of China. The palace is basically divided into two parts, the front was used by the staff and officials as well as it was used to meet foreign dignatories whereas the back part was the living area for the emperor and his family. It is a vast place with a lot of rooms still furnished with effects that are thousands of years old. Each room and every object in that room is special and deserves a close and careful look. I have never been to a place as rich and big as this. The next most historical place that I can think of is the pyramids of Giza but they are empty now since most of their effects have either been looted or transferred to the national museum in Cairo, but those are mostly ornaments and marks made of gold but in the forbidden city it is the daily use objects that are kept in the relevant rooms with proper restoration and necessary explanation. You need to have a lot of time and patience at hand to really see and appreciate each object. The streets, corridors, verandas and rooms of the palace each have a history to tell. The place is usually full of people and groups of visitors. I would advise you to go there with a gourd guide who can explain to you the history and put everything into perspective.

I have been to the forbidden city earlier in 2011 but it was just as enriching to see it again.

During my visit to Seoul, South Korea, I happen to see a palace next to the National Museum, very similar to the forbidden city. The South Korean guide told the tourists that the forbidden city is the copy of the Korean palace. Well, I don't ghjbk so since from what I know the forbidden city is at least a thousand years older than the Korean palace.

Although the forbidden city is a heaven for history lovers, it might not be a very exciting place for young children, therefore their lack of enthusiasm may shorten your span of the visit or may not let you enjoy it as much as you should"
"This is one of the must see sight in Beijing and for anyone who is remotely interested in Chinese history, this is a first stop. However, compared to early 2000 when I first visited it, the place has become more run down with peeling paint everywhere and dusty walls, ceiling and floors in all halls even in cordoned off areas. The place is also swamped with tourist bit good thing is they don't linger and only care for the few seconds to snap another photo. The garden at the end is lovely with some of the most amazing old trees."
"Get your walking shoes and your camera redy. This is a must see. If you watch ""The last Emperor"" movie, you will appreciate it more. I found the concubine section very interesting. Their levels and the role they played.Do some studying before you go, you will appreciate all the symbolism everywhere and reason for each section. This place is huge but a must see. Don't rush it and take your time."
You can't go to Beijing and not see the FC. It's very grand and has some fantastic sights. I'd be wary of people offering to guide you as soon as you get out of your taxi. We used the audio guides on offer which were inexpensive and worked fine. My advice would be to start at Tiananmen Sq and then head up through FC. At the end of the FC exit there are lots of people pushing to sell you rides through the Hutongs. Don't pay more than ¥50 for this but it is a side of Beijing worth seeing and I wouldn't walk it. The park behind is worth a visit and the views at the top are great. Be careful not to finish your day out at rush hour as the traffic gets crazy around 5pm.
"Enjoyed our visit, had a great tour guide who gave a fantastic insight into how life was lived in the time of the Emperors.
Work to restore parts of the city is in progress, but what stands out"
"We stayed here for over 6 hours. You would like it if you like history. A place worthy of visit. Better prepare some snack, food and drink as there is only one restaurant inside. Food is just average."
"Very impressive, much bigger then I imagined, allow a good few hours to go from one end to the other. There's a lot of walking and steps and very crowded. We found the Chinese are very security aware and lines to go through the scanners. Police and soldiers everywhere too.
Allow plenty of time to visit this and any other attraction in Beijing. This isn't wheelchair friendly"
Forbidden City is definitely HUGE! I just read this in textbooks before but when finally I got the chance to visit it. I was amazed! Just take a photo on the first part upon entering because everything looks the same though.
Visted on Tuesday 19/04 and found crowded but still accessible. We used the auto guide to help us which worked well after some initial issues ( No deposit required). All in all the experience was good but do be aware of the crowds. Looking inside some of the palace buildings did prove impossible due to crowds. Security to gain access was OK but do remember to take your passport / ID in order to get through security and buy tickets. Selfie sticks every where in Chinese tourist spots but you will get used to these. Once you get used to the crowds the visit is acceptable the buildings should be appreciated for the work which went into the construction and decoration which is very intricate. Some decoration can be difficult to see being high up. We stayed only on the central part of the Forbidden City taking about two hours to pass through. Allow longer if visiting both East and West buildings These areas are quiet. Good shoes required as only walking access not difficult with good stairs I imagine disabled / wheelchair users may have some difficulty. Suitable for older visitors but young children may find it boring.
"First is like to describe an accident I was a witness off. The wind was a little strong on the day of my visit. And one of the laterns balls (two of them at once) broke and fell down on people standing right under that latern. They were hurt. Thank god not killed. So try not to stand under those laterns!!
Ok. Review. My time in Beijing, of course want to see the most famous sightseeing. The traditional Chinese architecture, so different from European styles fascinates you first. But everything seems to be the same as you go further. Here it comes to my mind that the palaces of Europe are so much richer, more exciting and more impressive. Loved the pieces from emperors birthday museum though. That was interesting and you feel a touch to the history.
You can not go inside of the other buildings and you only look in through the windows and crowds of people and their phones/iPads. Thank god I'm tall. Otherwise I wouldn't see anything. That was disappointing."
"Lots to see here, although also lots of people. We had a nice little wander around slacking up history and culture. Must see spot."
We went here on our China tour so a visit to the forbidden city is a must. Once only the royal family and its servants could be here now all can see it !
Outstanding place to visit. the statues situated within the complex and the architecture are amazing. Well worth the time.
"one of the top 3 places in beijing. I was pleasantly surprised by the visit because it expected it to be good but I never imagined it would be spectacular. the place has history, beauty and many places to visit. The audio guide is a good idea to accompany you during the visit, is necessary to give a prudent time to visit, can not be less than 3 or 4 hours (I take 6 hours). Do not miss anything and visit the temples of the sides to not end quickly at the start. Besides the obvious places, worth the gallery of clocks and theater multistory they had at the time to provide entertainment for the emperor. It is essential to try to come early to avoid suffering waves of tourists. You can see from the halls of the emperors to where they lived their wives or consorts. there is a story behind another as it progresses."
"Though this place is impressive the amount of time you spend in traffic to get there is plain crazy. Then the lines to get through security are huge. Now the ticket line and the crowds to get through doorways!!

Avoid going on the weekends as it seems everyone in the world is there. Maybe weekdays are better.

The palace grounds are huge and it takes time to walk and explore. There are some amazing things to see and to contemplate what life would have been like. But it's really not pleasant when it's so packed.

Then it's leaving time and there are hundreds of hawkers blocking the passages and hustling you. And the traffic again.

Try a weekend if you must."
"Read up on the various palaces located in this area, before you go. It will help you understand the intricacies of court life. Look up at the roof lines, around the stairways, at the bridges, and in the various rooms of the palaces. This may be daunting on a crowded day. Don't rush,..but be prepared for a long day, to get the most out of your visit."
"It's crowded. No matter how early you go, there are hordes of people.

Because there was some sort of visit or official exercise, the main routes were closed. As a result, if I didn't pay extra for the museum tickets, my visit to the Forbidden City would've ended in half an hour.

The clocks museum was mildly interesting, but didn't see any clocks actually ticking.

A lot of areas were blocked off/closed. So when the audio guide says ""feel free to explore the area"", all you felt was frustration and disappointment.

People talk about a deposit for the audio guide. It's no longer required. You just pay for rental. And the guide emits a very long beep so you won't forget to return the darn thing.

For me, the visit was a disappointment. Other than the ability to say I visited the place, it wasn't good enough. There are better things to do with one's time in Beijing."
Wow this place was so big it took a couple of hours to see it all but I suggest you have a guide to explain everything to you
I have always wanted to see this masterpiece of Chinese civilization . But I was disappointed. The buildings are in need of repair. You can not go inside. Expect a lot of people pushing. You did get a feel for how expansive the site was. I had expected to see inside the buildings and see some Chinese artifacts from that era.
"I arrived at about 9am on a Sunday and it was already lined up; took about 50 minutes to get inside.
The buildings are well preserved on the outside but inside were largely off limits so that was disappointing.
After a few hours the buildings all look the same.
While it is a must see attraction the crowds and the pushing at building entrances made the experience mostly unpleasant.
I would not visit this site again.
Be advised that there is no exit near the main entrance so you hav to keep moving towards the exit.
If you want to see everything you would have to zigzag your way through but again, after a few hours each building looks like the previous one.
Given the width of the site it would make sense to have a route up one side and back along the other.
To get back to Tiannanmen Square and public transit is a very long walk from the exit."
No visit to Beijing is complete without seeing the forbidden city. It was over crowded when we visited in early April due to the Chinese public holiday but it was still worth it. The place is massive and it has so much history. Make sure to walk to the top of the hill that is located in the park that is cross the street from the south gate (exit gate) for amazing views of the forbidden city
"Worth watching ""The Last Emperor"" to help you envisage how the place looked and functioned in its last days. Needs a full half day to get around adequately even without visiting some of the special museums. The Paintings Collection is particularly famous and important but sadly we didn't have time to include it."
"Must go when you in Beijing, but avoid weekends and public holidays where the place is crowded with people. Beside those magnificent architecture, it better appreciated by understanding those history behind each palaces, as each palace serve dedicated purposes for the Emperor. So either get a local tour guide or at least rent a recorder where it will tell you the history behind each palace as you walk pass them. Also after you exit the museum advise to hop up the special tourist bus that will bring you to Wang Fu Jin walking alley or back to the Tiananmen train station or you could proceed to scroll Tiananmen Square."
Start early! Theres so many things to see and you'll be on your feet most of time. The structures are amazingly restored and most are still the same as it was before. Realize the fundamentals of feng sui in making this wonderful city.
Beware of fake guides you can take a recorder after paying a fees.There is a pottery museum inside which is worth a visit. Always have the translator app. in your mobile as it's very helpful in making people understand in BEIJING.
"Historic must see. Lots of people. Not a lot of displays. You can see it without a guide if you want to just see it. It has English Signs everywhere. If you want more, get a guide. Watch the last emperor before. Keep wallets safe. Bring water. Pay for the extra exhibits, less people and more to see."
You arrive a Tianamen square in front of the palace entrance. The square is vast and as a result rather impersonal and to me somewhat of a disappointment. The forbidden city itself is however magnificent as one walks though from one courtyard to the next. Apart from a small garden at the exit which consists mainly of weird shaped rocks and some trees and other vegetation the rest of the forbidden city is treeless as the emperor was afraid that assassins might hide in the foliage. One can enter the large public halls but the smaller rooms which housed the concubines and the eunuchs were all closed. If there is a criticism to be made it is that it would be nice to see how the inhabitants actually lived within these grand spaces.
"This is a wonderful place to visit. It gives you a pretty good idea about the ancient court life in China. If you are going to Beijing, this should definitely visit here. But when you visit, you should know two things. First of all, this place has been restored to the point that it is obvious to even a brief glance. Also, the tourists there are pushy and rude. They all want the same picture and they will do their best to push you out of the way."
"The Forbidden City is a huge complex and is therefore quite impressive based on size alone. I was disappointed that one cannot enter the hall that served as a throne room, though I can understand why one must view the smallish rooms of the last dowager empress through glass. There was quite a crowd at the Forbidden City on the day we went there; if you plan to go on a warm day, you may want to book a tour instead of arranging your own visit in order to avoid standing in a long security line."
"You need a very knowledgable guide for this one I found it interesting for the architecture and history. See the movie before the tour and the tour will come alive. It's a good walk through the palace so wear comfy shoes and don't forget to get you photo with you in front and the Chairmanning the background! FYI, all the walls outside are made of white Jade and the Lions are not the same the male have the ball under his foot. (wink)"
"Truly one of the worlds most historic and special places. It is a long walk, but so very worth every moment. Keep your backpacks or wallets in front of you and wear good walking shoes. The crowd can be very pushy so be prepared with a good attitude. If you are Western, be prepared to have your picture taken."
"This is the must see if in Beijing!

Get a local guide (before you arrive) so you can by-pass the entry ticket queue.

Closed on a Monday!

Was a 'living city' for the emperor until 1912 and was built in 1420.

So much to see .... Don't rush and miss some of the hidden gems that a good guide will take you into.

The garden is a must with trees up to 500 years old!

A photographers dream

You can imagine city life in the times gone by....

.... Iconic!"
"Highly recommend, very interesting, whole thing feels like a museum now rather than a city. Very pristine, gives lots of space to think."
"Caution: We had an amazing tour guide how helped us around the whole place, its a lot of walk and you will need a tour guide who would tell you everything about the place like history and how its was made and all the stuff.

Must see when in Beijing."
"Without someone to show us around this immense compound, our experience would have certainly been lacking. Our guide told us stories, took us around to see the most important sites, and explained what the buildings were used for. Our favorite areas to visit were the gardens and the concubine quarters."
"Went here early April and was really interesting to learn about this Forbidden city built during the Ming Dynasty around 1420 for the Emperor and his family to live and rein supremely over China. The palaces,Temples and halls built with amazing architecture that symbolised the wealth. 2 huge bronze lions adorn the gate of the palace.
You will need a copy of your passport or some valid ID to buy a ticket to get into the Forbidden City. I had a copy on my phone which is handy to have when travelling overseas."
"This is a large complex, so bring your walking shoes.

The crowds get thick after 10AM. Arrive early, and sprint to the middle of the complex for some pictures of you and your party before the masses arrive. After that, expect between a dozen and 200 people to be in the background of every picture you take.

Most of the buildings have open doors but about half have ropes across to prevent entry. You can take pictures from the open doors in most cases, but you'll see signs indicating ""no flash photography"" or ""no cameras"". These signs are often ignored as you see flashes going off. But somehow, while others get away with it, when you take your picture, you get a stern warning from a guard or staff.

There's a couple restaurants, and there are several coffee and/or snack stands inside. The price is higher than you'd pay on the street, but leaving and coming back in is a pain. Just accept the price and carry on. Try eating before 11:30AM or well after 1PM. The place was slammed at noon with a long wait for a table. However, if you arrive early in the morning, you might be ready to leave and get better food outside by 1PM.

Around the side of the Forbidden City is what looks like a moat. If you head to the west side, you'll figure out this is fed by Houhai Lake (actually of a series of very small lakes). There's a couple little restaurants around the edge of the lake, and it's a nice walk to the northwest of the FC. There's supposed to be no swimming, but as soon as the sun goes down, dozens of locals go for a swim in the summer time. In winter, it will be frozen over, so if you see others walking on it, you can too with a fair amount of safety. You might even see ice skating, and skates for rent. Whatever season, a walk around Houhai is the best way to finish your Forbidden City tour. It also gives you a chance to see the place from the outside (which gives you a different point of view and concept of the scale of the place).

If you don't like the lake walk idea, just head across Tian'anmen Square. It's an 800m (half a mile) walk across Tian'anmen to some cool little shops and restaurants at Qianmen (the main gate). The north bathroom at Tian'anmen is just across the street from the entrance of the Forbidden City. This is probably the best public bathroom in all of China.

Crowds are much thinner in the Winter, and on rainy days any time of year. September is the best month to visit the FC (best weather, reasonable crowd size). Do not ever try to visit in the first week of October. This is the national holiday, and the FC is filled to capacity with Chinese folks from all over the country.

I should mention that I live on and off in Beijing, and often act as tour guide for visiting friends. So I have made many trips to the FC."
"It's neither a city, nor forbidden. Yea, it's ok. Guess it's one of those thing one have to see while in Beijing. Was not very impressed with Beijing overall. Very polluted, and cold. The city is crowded with long lines. Unless you have a guide, you don't know what you're looking at."
Great place to visit while in Beijing. The historical stories behind this attraction is very interesting as you get to see the spots of settlement from the stories. The historical and authenticity value of the buildings were maintained even though some repairing has been made. The only flaw of this attraction is the massive number of visitors where people will find it quite difficult to take good pictures as well as move from one place to another.
this was a very nice experience. The place is picturesque with a very rich history. It was very crowded though but overall it was a great experience
First time to see a temple with a great tradition . Cultural and history is alive! . Hail Beijing ! Great Scenery .
It is a beautiful palace ground. Filled with intricate history and great for those who look towards historical facts
Too crowdy place would prefer to spend this time in a park or any other place. Once you are in there's no way back you just need to continue walking with all the mass of people. Chinese are not nice and polite though even these who work there scream and push people and almost nobody speaks English even in such a touristic place..
"It gets busy, so wear comfortable shoes! Just be sure to have someone show you around if you don't read/speak their language so you can appreciate and not be overwhelmed at the same time.
In April it gets windy"
"The city area is huge and with the crowds, not a place you can rush around. You really need to allow several hours to enjoy a proper visit.

The fascinating architecture and history make this a unique place. So many places to discover around every corner.

It really is worth getting a tour guide to understand the history."
"The weather was excellent when we visited.April is good month I was told by the guide.We had a guided tour with earphones and the commentary was played each place we stopped. The whole structure is well preserved and its a pride for Chinese people and righly so. Superb structure and many old traditions that where the king met his people or where were the prayers done and all about the queens rest area and son on.It takes about 2 hours minimum,.Please carry water with you and some juice or small eats or fruit as you maybe down with sugar as there is a long walk .After you see don't forget to go to the other side of the road and climb up through the park to go to the top of the hill and see the forbidden city from the top of that small hill. Its a treat to watch the roof and the majestic view is there in my mind.Be careful of pickpoeters.When you come down please do not take hire small rickshaw fellows..they are not safe."
"A visit to the forbidden city is a must in Beijing but the crowds make a big difference and vary greatly depending on timing. April is clearly a popular time so the crowds were crazy. The number of visitors made it hard to see the beautiful palace interiors and we were whisked through by our tour guide.

I have visited previously in January just before Chinese New Year and had a very different experience. At that time of year the Forbidden City was almost quiet by comparison and we had plenty of time to look around. I suggest that if you have some flexibility in your schedule you choose your time carefully so that you can get the most out of your visit."
"This is an enormous Palace of unbelievable scale. Tours allow you up to 4 hours to see this place which could easily take a whole day. Most commonly seen is the palace, large courtyard and bridges but to the sides are the corridors to garden, housing for 1000s of staffers, concubine quarters and enuch advisors.
The Forbidden City was just that. Common people never saw the inside. Fewer staffers, enuch and concubines ever entered the palace itself. Roof structures and symbols on individual buildings indicated rank and position. Most buildings are closed but some are open for viewing outside the doors."
"This seems like a must do in Beijing, and its definitely impressive to see, if overwhelming at some point. Check it off the list"
Absolutely must see the Forbidden City. It is absolutely huge so plan a few hours to even figure out how to get out! Beautiful lake and park to sit and people watch. Very crowded on the weekend.
A must see and fascinating to learn about the history. It was very busy when we visited but it is a big place and so not to bad.
This is a huge area. Wear good walking shoes. Take your time. Stop and rest from time to time. You could easily spend a day here and not see everything. Phenomenal exhibits. We rented recorded tour audio - it was ok. We would have preferred a personal guide but they were all committed that day. A must see.
"I'd been wanting to see the Forbidden City for decades, and the experience did not disappoint. The FC is an almost 200-acre compound consisting of multiple buildings and courtyards. The architecture is grand and you get a feel for the grandeur of the place when emperors lived there. However, it is pretty crowded (our tour was there on a Tuesday), and there were lots of domestic as well as international tourists. There are only a couple of halls that are furnished- one of the them was so mobbed that everyone was pushing and elbowing people out of the way to see and take pictures. Although it is nominally a museum, there are no exhibits of items with labels and explanations, so if you have a chance to see exhibits on the FC in other places, I'd encourage seeing those for additional context. Also, I went on a tour and was extremely glad I did, because we got to go through a separate entrance that wasn't too crowded, plus we got information about what we were seeing and what was or was not worth spending lots of time on."
Take your time to stroll around in the side parts of the main palace ... really worth spending some time strolling around there!
The Forbidden City is huge! I enjoyed seeing the historical structures. I was able to walk from my hotel. I visited on a Tuesday and it was not crowded.
Great piece of palace architecture from the Ming and Qing dynasties period - must not missed if you are in Beijing
"I would say to get the audio tour. I did not and simply used the Beijing guide from Lonely Planet and found myself thinking we were looking at places we had already passed.

I would definitely tell you to go to this while visiting Beijing mainly because it would be embarrassing to say you were in Beijing for a couple days and did not fit the Forbidden City in."
"It's ironic to complain that China is too crowded. I know. I'm precious. Unfortunately, the Forbidden City is not very well regulated and it is quite overcrowded. A shame, because the Forbidden City is absolutely spectacular and of great historic importance. The audio guide was also faulty so I don't recommend this.

If you really want to enjoy the Forbidden City, consider getting a private tour or go when it is Winter. On a warm Spring day, we found ourselves crushed by tour groups fighting to see the Dragon Throne so it wasn't such a pleasant experience. If the crowds were better managed, Forbidden City would be less formidable. Be careful with kids!"
"Perhaps the most disappointing over-rated must-see place in Beijing. The historical significance of the Forbidden City in undeniable, but the crowd is something to be reckon, especially when you are with children, and to have to jostle with crowd of people that are disrespectful of queues, uncaring of children and frequently rude. I will not go back, and you're not missing much if you skip the Forbidden City - it's a vast lonely place with large imposing buildings."
"First off, my main tip is don’t bother with the English self-guided audio tour. At 40 RMB it’s really not that much but it was very spotty…tended to cut out if I did anything other than standstill once it started talking and there was no way to rewind or get it back. Aside from not being user friendly there was nothing that the guide said that was not written in English in front of the very sites.

Obviously you have to see this if you come to Beijing. It’s like Fisherman’s Wharf in San Francisco, The Eiffel Tower in Paris, or the Statue of Liberty in New York. All very interesting and all relevant in their own unique ways. But all of these tend not to live up to the hype. Also keep in mind that you will be drowning in a sea of humanity. The picturesque images of the empty squares in front of the various palaces that are featured so prominently in brochures and ads are absent when it is actually open for business. It gets pretty rough when you get close to the actual areas where you view the throne room, lots of people pushing and shoving to get to the front. Hey, it’s Beijing. It’s not like people were throwing elbows but they were definitely not shy about pushing into and past you to get the best possible view.

I enjoyed seeing it but really the best part was not the featured palaces and throne rooms but rather the much quieter and more peaceful gardens behind the palaces. Some interesting exhibits in side palaces, particularly the gardens."
"Facinating place to visit,this was also part of a coach tour.
The temperature was 35degrees and there is a lot of walking so take plenty of water
Beware there are literally thousands of people at this venue
Well worth a visit"
"The incredible imperial palace, GuGong or Forbidden City, is deserved to be ranking as the top of must visit in Beijing. You need more than 3 hours to walk around the city. What I recommend is you should bring a bottle of water and some food 'cos you will lost a ton of energy for walk, walk and walk around inside the palace. This is more than 500 years of heritage of history from Ming to Qing dynasty in China. You must visit this place before you die folks!!! - For me only one is not enough.

Take Subway Line 1, and get off at Tiananmen East Station Exit A. Ticket is not expensive -60 RMB.

"We were mostly visiting the Forbidden City because you have to, if you visit Beijing, and I wasn't expecting to be too into it. But it was far more interesting than I'd expected. The feeling of history is alive there, and the vastness of the buildings and the grounds is like nothing you can estimate from pictures and television. It must be felt, smelled, walked, wandered and fully experienced to understand.

The grounds are so much larger than I'd expected; we walked all the way through, from Tiananmen Square, and got a taxi on the other side. It was a lot of walking!

April was hot and humid, so I wouldn't want to go in the summer! It was crowded, but mostly not too bad."
"We went in April very warm but tolerable wouldn't like to go in the heat of summer as you have to be prepared for a lot of walking, the place just goes on and on section after section. Like all the other highlight areas of China you have to see and experience the place for yourself"
"We went on Qing Ming Festival...don't do that unless you really like the crush of humanity whilst touring. I live in China and was still overwhelmed by the amount of people that were there. I dont know if on a regular day you can have access to buildings and are able to see artifacts, clothing and furnature but on this day we saw none of the above. I would recommend not going on a national holiday and definitely go with a translator or tour guide as I did not see many signs in English. I think it would have been quite fabulous without the crowds and If I would have known the history of what I say..."
"We went along to the Forbidden City like most Westerners on our own. The first thing you'll notice is that everyone else seems to be in groups - but don't worry about that as you'll easily find a tour guide of your own.

We knew a little about the place - but it's so huge we wanted someone to take us around. We'd had a few offers from guides around Beijing but risked just turning up and seeing who we could find.

Just past the main gate and where you can buy your tickets you'll get approached by a number of tour guides who seem to be plying their trade discreetly - we went for one of these. A young Chinese lady with brilliant English. We paid for us, and her to get into the Palace Museum and the park behind it and agreed to pay her 200¥ for the tour.

It was well worth the money as the site is HUGE and there is lots to take in so its worth having someone who can fill in the gaps and give it all some context.

By far the best bit of our experience came at the end however - and don't miss this.

Our guide took us into the park across the road at the far end of the museum. Follow the path all the way around - past the famous tree where the last Ming Emperor killed himself - and you get to a couple of small buildings. One of these is the Imperial Tea House.

Our guide took us in and a lady came with a tea set and 6 different teas to try. We were there a good 45 mins - she told us all about tea, what we were drinking, and made it all herself in front of us. We bought our favourite from her - and also the tea set to make it for just 150¥.
It was the best bit by far of our whole day - and we were the only people in there.
The whole tea tasting was just 50¥ for two of us and our guide.

Make sure you find it. Lovely end to a day of walking around the Forbidden City."
This is an Excellent Place in heart of Beijing. Big ground to cover to prepare for walk. Great architecture.
"I visited Beijing last August with my friend . As it as local holidays in China , it was too much crowded . It took nearly 1 hour to get inside the Palace . It was a worthwhile experience visiting the place . What a wonderful Chinese architecture . It took around 2 hours for us to look into everything . We were bit fast and it will take a whole day if you want to have a look in detail . But I would suggest not to go in local holidays as it is too much crowded .

Beware of one fact :
As soon as you get out of the palace tour , there are lot of cycle rickshaws who pesture you to take a ride around the city . But try not to use them if you don't have any local guide or any local person or else you will be taken for a ride . They agree you with a price for a ride and as soon as it is over they over charge you and pick up a fight with you . So better be careful with the rickshaw . Taxis too have meter but they don't use it . Make it clear to them the rate and then get into the taxi as well ."
A fully enclosed area with multiple buildings and gardens. Best to go early season or early morning as it gets extremely busy. Best to exit at a side gate if possible as the walk round the wall from the back exit to the front is a few miles.
"After reading so many reviews of touring The Forbidden City with massive crowds on a bad smog day, it was a pleasure to walk this historic area on a breezy day in early April, with sparse crowds. Consequently, we were able to access the various areas within the city walls quite easily. Yes, it is massive, and it takes a while to discover all the varied areas of the city, which really can't be done in less than 4 hours. Peeking into the different structures, seeing the Emperor's thrones, etc., is incredible. A do not miss is the Emperor's private garden, complete with unusual rock formations, and beautiful trees, planting, pathways, etc. This is truly a ""ctiy"" within a city. A word of caution for those with disabilities: The Forbidden City is not easy to navigate. Uneven cobbled walkways, steep stairs, and lengthy distances to traverse will be a challenge for many people. Make sure to arrive well ahead of closing. The guards will literally kick you out of the city when the bells toll."
"Visited as part of a tour so no issues with getting here & queueing up to get tickets. The history with this place is amazing! Allow quite a few hours to get through it from the south entrance to the north- it is Huge!! Definetly wear good walking shoes if you want to avoid blisters...!
Small area inside where you can buy sonething to eat (limited choice) & some shops (nothing major)
The Imperial Garden within is beautiful! Would definetly recommend seeing this if you come to Beijing!"
Beautiful and a must see if you are in Beijing. Its very big so be prepared to walk a lot. Also it can get very crowded so avoidable during peak tourist times.
"During the summer, this place is packed. It's Disney World in July times 10. That being said, whether you can avoid the crowds or not, just arrive early and enjoy the beautiful heritage side, using a automated guide to learn about its history. It's quite beautiful"
"The Forbidden City must be the sign the attractions, very worth a visit. Tickets for the best in the Palace site scheduled in advance, because every day there is a limit of 8 million people, is scheduled to can the trouble that eliminates the need to queue up to buy tickets, scheduled, as long as live brush card can into the National Palace, to buy tickets for the best choice with the treasures from the museum, or is an important part of the attractions are not to go into, also does not look to Zhenfei wells. There is a strong suggestion for explain, explain here is provided free of charge, and does not require a deposit, each to a spot to play automatically to explain, very easy to use. As for the tour route, that time, according to the attached map across the board visit, careful stroll down about 6 hours time. Is there a restaurant inside the palace treasures from the museum near the entrance, price is still acceptable, with no solid food can simply here to solve the food problem. The National Palace Museum shenwumen, across the street is Jingshan Park, if there is time and energy, can also to Jingshan Park Hill, again in Beijing, the city of high point an aerial exhibition about the palace buildings, feel its overall layout.
If you need more information, you can contact me: email:Phoebezhengjuan@163.com facebook:Phoebezhengjuan@163.com"
The city was amazing and you could tell they were putting a lot of work into it to make it more safe and beautiful. The outside of the city however was. But confusing. The taxi drivers can't stop in front the north and south gates so ours dropped us off the east gate but there were no signs directing where to go to buy tickets. We finally asked some men who had a guide and they helped us get tickets. There are also a lot of people trying to scam you outside the city walls so becareful and don't go to any tea shops or take rickshaw. Other than that the palace was nice and in good shape. Pretty crowded and we went on a Friday. So I am note sure if Friday and the weekend are more busy.
"The heritage historical palace is situated in the central of Beijing. The entrance fee have separate high season & low season rate. The construction is huge & elegant. The empire area is great.
As least you need to spend four hours to walk though the palace."
"the place is vast.. and one needs to be prepared to walk!!
The place is historic.. one can get the touristy Beijing picture clicked here!!"
"It is definitely one of the landmarks of Beijing and maybe of China.

The grandiosity and history of this very important place not only of China but also of the entire world is a must see when you visit Beijing. It is interesting to understand the importance, purpose and the meaning of at list all the main edifices and structures of this “City”.

You can reach the place by Metro line 1, Tian'an men dong or Tian'an men xi stations. Take into consideration that there are checking points previous to the entrance of the Forbidden City, it means sometimes long lines and time.

There is an admission of 40 RMB. It worth any penny!!"
"Spent half a day and saw such a small part of it. It is Very busy, but well worth the visit. I wished I had had time to get up Tiananmen gate to overlook the square. Maybe next time."
Amazing to see it live. More spectacular than expected and covering a huge area. Lots of courtyards and buildings before you get to the main palace. Go early to avoid huge crowds of people all wanting to see everything.
"We have been here last week for a study tour from Denmark.If you are in Beijing,Forbidden city should be on your list.
You can get an overview how the Chinese dynasties lived."
"Get there as early as you can to get a bit more space (it'll never be quiet but the coaches won't be there at 8.30), take your ID with you when you get your ticket (driving license or passport) and enjoy walking through immense architecture & history"
"I was on a business trip so sightseeing time was limited!

We made it to the gates of the Forbidden City 3 mins before they stopped entry . ..PHEW!

Leaving us about an hour to see what I would leave a day for. It is HOOGE and awe inspiring in sheer size, design and architecture.

We dashed through and got a flavour but I would definitely return and spend some time."
This palace is amazing and so big. we didn't realize the size once we entered it is enormous and an amazing experience. Totally totally worth the visit and can be done by yourself with out being on a tour so you can take your time and don't have to be rushed.
"The forbidden city its n old and huge city u will walk and see some old details , for me the forbidden city was a good place cz it's must but only for 10 min not more ,"
Now you are required to present IDs to buy tickets. Wait at least one hour to get in (in summer time). The palace is impressive. but it's a tiresome visit if you have small kids.
"I was very disappointed, so much has been taken away, its a museum, with very little artifacts. An impressive structure, but be prepared to be with thousands of people. enjoy your walk but do not expect to see much of the old china."
Enormous and fascinating. A great insight into how the Emperor lived. Spring is a great time to go. Although still busy not too over-crowded.
"Ofcourse you have visit the palace museum, the official name for the Forbidden city when you are in Beijing. The whole complex is impressive, but the buildings itself and especially the interior, (which in many cases, you can't enter, but just glance at from the outside), were a bit disappointing to us.

Tip: climb the hill in neighbouring Yingshan park (to the north of the forbidden city) where you will have a great view over the whole complex, to get a better sense of its magnitude."
If you are in Beijing this must be visited. It really helped me better understand the history and lifestyle of the Emperors of China. It is very crowded. We toured on our own and enjoyed the audio we rented. The garden at the end was lovely.
"We toured Tienanmen Square and the Forbidden City with Sinorama tours. Tienanmen Square is huge, but it's just a square. After a few pictures, you will be done and will want to walk to the entrance of the Forbidden City (where Mao's picture hangs). It was surprising how immense the Forbidden City is. We probably only walked through about 1/10th of it. The information about life within the complex was very interesting and the buildings are beautiful and restored well. You will feel like you are on a movie set. Practical info: Keep in mind that between Tienanmen Square and the Forbidden City you will do a lot of walking (over an hour) including lots of steps. If you need assistance you can hire a wheelchair and a wheelchair 'driver' for about $15 US. (The wheelchair folks didn't fend very well within the Forbidden City.) In late March it was already very warm and you are in direct sun for almost the entire time. Bring water and sunscreen. Bathrooms within the Forbidden City are not great. Bring toilet paper."
The scale of the place left me speechless. There is so much to see you would probably need a week to see it all. You definitely need a full day. Entry is 90 yuan for an adult and 60 yuan for the over 60s. You also need ID in the form of a passport or a copy. Once inside you can purchase a set of headphones for your own private tour. You can then learn the fascinating history at your leisure. Most exhibits have signs in English . Some parts of the city area are qite uneven to walk on. There is also a lovely area of blossoms. Well worth a visit.
There are a lot of people inside the site. There is an entrance fee. The place is very huge and you can buy food in the vicinity. There are free maps that you can get inside the city.
"Very crowded, it worth to pay the extra ticket to see the mini palaces. The treasure Palace was nice"
"If you do one thing in Beijing, it's the Forbidden City. If you have a chance to go outside Beijing, then Great Wall. There is so much history here, and it's simple awesome, in that it is awe inspiring. We took a guided tour with Lily's Beijing Private Tour and she was incredible. She knew so much about the history and told us all sorts of cool stories. Go here!"
"Best palace we explored during our Asia trip. It is huge, historic and absolutely grand. A absolute must do when in Beijing. We would say it was suitable for all ages, but requires lots of walking to cover and view the whole site. Kids seemed amused enough to continue with us."
"One can see how emperors lived in old world China if you visit Forbidden City. Only draw back is too many local people pushing around, cutting you off, etc limiting your ability to enjoy the visit little more. You cannot go inside the palaces for sure for the same reason I mentioned above, too many people touching everything so the authorities block eople from entering into palaces to prevent the palaces from getting damaged."
"We first visited in June 2015 and once again in March 2016. It was less crowded during the “off-peak” session in March, but still quite crowded by any standards.

The first time we went, we were led by our private guide through the central axis and some important rooms (e.g. the emperor’s chambers, throne room, etc). With the huge crowds trying to peer into each room or hall, it was not a pleasant experience at all. As there isn’t any system of crowd control or security within the complex or around each building, the jostling and shoving by the domestic tourist crowds can be very daunting indeed. The situation is pretty much the same even during the “off-peak” season.

During our second visit, we eschewed the main thoroughfares and elected to walk along the right side (east) of the huge complex . It was a good decision, allowing us to take in a different perspective of the main buildings and all the details that we had missed during our first visit. It was also a lot less crowded once we were away the central axis.

It is perhaps a bit misleading to label this attraction a museum. If you are expecting well-preserved artefact or treasures, then you will be disappointed. The Treasure Gallery (which required an additional RMB20 per pax for entry) was sparse by international standards, although it had some interesting items on display.

Overall, the various rooms, chambers and halls looked like they are in dire need of expert conservation advice. Given China’s rich history and the thousands of visitors the Forbidden City attracts, it is a pity that minimal effort is put into preserving this World Heritage site. The 3 main halls, historical external marble structures and wall carvings are all exposed to the elements – polluted air, haze, humidity and possibly acid rain. While some of the main chambers and imperial living quarters were shut, presumably to preserve them for posterity, peering through small dusty windows into dark rooms while jostling shoulder-to-shoulder with a few dozen local tourists does not qualify as a world-class museum experience.

However, despite all its shortcomings, one cannot help but feel in awe once in the Forbidden City. Like the Colosseum, the beauty of the Forbidden City lies in its historical significance, the magnificence of the structures and the size of the awe-inspiring complex itself. One can only hope that the museum administration will do more to preserve this beautiful complex. Some parts of it are literally falling to bits :(

Tips:
- Be prepared to walk....a lot!
- Bring a bottle of water with you.
- Avoid Mondays, as it is closed.
- Go early and be prepared to queue (and to be pushed) to get past the security screening.
- Bring your passport to purchase tickets, if you are not going with a tour group.
- Download maps to your phone before visiting, it helps with finding your way around.
- It is possible to backtrack once you reach the northern end (before the gardens) and walk back to towards the Meridian Gate and exit via Donghuamen on the east side. The street outside Donghuamen will lead you straight to Wangfujing Street.
- If you can, avoid using the toilets in the complex. The queues are long!"
"Lots of history to see and hear, a must place to visit and spend the day - a little crowded though and a lot of walking."
"Worth the visit! Such an amazing place I wish I could have spent more time here! My 7Yo was bored after 1 hour so we rushed the last bit, but I thoroughly enjoyed the experience all the same."
Awesome place to visit. Be prepared to walk for a long time with some stairs. Buildings begin looking all the same but as you trek to the back you begin to find the true character and personality of the grounds. Very cheap to enter but you MUST bring your passport to buy a ticket....no exceptions. A must do!
"I was surprised at the size of this beautiful complex. Every time I thought we were at the end, there was more to see. We spent 2-3 hours at the site. As others have mentioned, be prepared for large crowds. It was disappointing that we could not enter the buildings. However, it was well worth a visit because of the Forbidden City's important place in Chinese history."
Must watch and need one whole day to see beside there also tianamen square enjoyed to buy tickets go there before 12 PM because some time ticket sold
bring small water containers/light snacks/goggles for Eyes/ mask ( if u dislike smokers) bring tissue papers
"Very educational. Only problem is that it is super crowded. Our tour guide said that the company only way you get to see the inside of the palace is do it the Chinese way- if they push you, push them back. That actually worked out right. Chinese people loves to push and overtake you or cut in front of you. But if you just let them taste their own medicine, you will enjoy. Other than that, it is very nice and educational. You will learn all about why it is called the Forbidden City and who used to live there and it's purpose."
"Seriously, this place gets a little repetitive, but you just can't understand the SCALE without visiting it. It's also in surprisingly good shape for something this old, likely because it was off limits to the general public for so long.

Make sure you see the Nine Dragon Screen. It's worth the extra five bucks to hit the treasure gallery."
"A place full of china's history, this place is fascinating from every corner. It will be highly recommended for you to get a local tour guide if you can understand mandarin.

The remarkable story starts at the entrance of the palace. Do you know that underneath the floor were many layers of bricks? The emperor did not want people to dig into the palace from underground and this such architecture was created.

As a chinese growing up watching Hong Kong series about China emperors and reading history books, everything become so lively as I enter the place and listen to the story telling from my tour guide.

The architecture is remarkable, the left over item from accessories to dresses and photos each have its own story. It is definitely a good place to spend the whole day to make sure you cover every single corner of the palace."
"You'll be outside at the Forbidden City at least 1/2 a day. You will absolutely need a mask (or masks). We just returned from a two week trip six days ago and there was heavy pollution everywhere. Also, the smell of the pollution is awful and the masks help with this pungent order. It is all-present throughout the entire country; It dis not stop, for two weeks, fourteen days. (Heavy pollution in all the following locations: Beijing, Great Wall, Xi'an, Chongqing, Yangtze river, Shanghai.) We both ended up infections from particles in the air despite wearing a mask, however we only brought two masks each which was not enough. We wish we'd purchased really good masks vs. the standard basic ones. One woman on are trip ended up in the hospital, another needed IV bags because they both got such bad respiratory infections and their temperatures rose so high then needed IV assistance to lower their temps. Both our our infections (also lung) are still not finished. You'll smell it the moment you walk off your plane. Here is one other idea for you besides a recommendation for masks: Two of the people in our group pro-actively took a round of '-Z-Pak' ( a zithromycin) on day three and they did not get sick. I would never pro-actively take antibiotics as I never get sick. I should have done it in China. We suggest you get a prescription from your doctor prior to leaving. In the end the majority of our tour (some 200 people) were given antibiotics by the riverboat ship's doctor. We loved China however the pollution took what could have been an 'A"" trip to a ""B-"" trip: the pollution is that omnipresent present. I wish we'd known and were prepared. We were not and the end result was not good."
"The centerpiece of Beijing. A visit is all about looking at the many buildings, mainly from the outside. It is important to have a guide to give you some narrative. Buildings have a similar style, though more variety in the North side. Very few artifacts around to look at. We had perfect weather - don't know how it would be in the rain. And busy busy busy. Has to be done I guess."
"This used to be a palace site and it is interesting to see what different rooms the Chinese emperors used in the past. The imperial garden at the back of the palace is pretty nice too. Only downside is too many people around, pushing and shoving."
To walk through those iconic gates beneath Mao's portrait is great in itself but once you enter the scale is breathtaking. Surrounded by grand structures on every side as you cross the bridge over the river. To see the intricacies up close you truly appreciate how amazing this place is.
It is definitely worth a visit . it is so big with lots of similar buildings. it was a bit boring for me.
A Beijing must! It is extraordinary! Walk through another time zone (except for all the other tourists!). It is beautiful. It gives you a very good feel for China at its ancient best!
"We visited in Sept 2007 and again in March 2016. It was supposed to be low season this time but still over 80,000. Visitors (99% Chinese) were expected to shuffle through.
Last time we visited we could enter many rooms and be only restricted by a loose rope suspended between posts. This time you weren't allowed past the doors of most buildings. Large areas are cordoned off and there were 5 times the people there. Ornate stairs are covered with wooden ones to protect them and are no longer visible.
If you wanted to see inside a building then you needed to brave to crush off 300 people all trying to see through the same door half with selfie sticks ready to get you in the eye. They push and shove and yell to their friends.
So after 3-4 hours of jostling you exit to the rear street where beggars await you - albeit they are not a problem and it's good to get breathing space again.

Is it worth it. Yes. Make sure the guide tells you the stories because without that it is not pleasant and it wouldn't make sense. Do it soon. After seeing the restrictions compared to 9 years before see it soon or maybe more restrictions will be in place."
"I was not expecting the amount of acreage that the Forbidden City encompasses! I knew it was large, but was still stunned. The buildings and gardens are quite amazing and unfathomable as to how they were constructed.
Be sure to dress properly, you'll be walking a lot and climbing as well.
It is very crowded and touristy, but once you get to the garden portion it feels less like a circus and more like an intimate experience.

Later in the day toward evening, I think it thins out a bit. The view from the very top temple is beautiful, so don't skip that last climb."
"The Forbidden City is the main attraction in Beijing, China. It is a fascinating complex to view but you should be prepared to walk for 4 hrs. or more, up and down many, many stairs, with up to 80,000 other visitors. The lines are long. Access is not easy so only the fit should visit."
"Another great spot to visit in Beijing. Buildings are amazing and so much space, hard to believe there is room for it in such a big city. Audio tour was a good option."
"The cradle of power and home to Chinese dynasties spanning almost 500 years. In a nutshell, it's 980 buildings over 180 acres surrounded by huge walls and canals so put on some good walking shoes and settle down to the fact that there's going to be a lot of walking... a LOT of walking. In fact there's so much to see that many Chinese tourists make a point of spreading their visit over the course of a few days rather than trying to cover the whole place in a single trip. So, don't be dissapointed if you return from a day trip having seen only a fraction of the palace. It's interesting to see how emperors of the past arranged their life with their political counselors, military advisors, wives, concubines etc all under one roof or 980 roofs to be precise. Definitely worth the trip if you have a free weekend. It's like a huge open air museum the likes of which you are unlikely to ever come across again. Everyone should see it with their own eyes at least once in their lifetime."
"The history of Forbidden City spans back to 100s of years from Ming dynasty to Qing dynasty -1420 to 1912. It took 14 years to complete the construction of this massive imperial palace in the 180 acre of land with 8700 rooms. A total of 24 generation of rulers were ruling China from this place. For foreigners it’s a must to carry passport to be provided with an entrance ticket. After the abdication of the last emperor of China “Puyi” the palace was converted into a Museum by the republican government of that time. In 1987 the Palace Museum was listed in the world heritage site by the UNESCO. All around, we could feel the presence of the military guarding the Palace as we went through the gates to the ticket counter. Shan stood in the que to get the ticket and I walked around the place looking around.

The crowd around us was humongous with tour groups and tourists making up the most part of the crowd and most of the tourist look to be older which can easily be said above 60. We entered into the palace by 8:30 and the colors that could not be missed are the red and yellow as the whole place is covered in them. The exit of the palace is at the back so the crowd has only one direction of flow reducing the congestion of the pouring tourists.

We walked slowly seeing most of the places of interest and taking pictures, but must say the palaces in India feel much more imperial than the palace we see here. The royalty of the place is not imminent and has to be reminded by our own conscious that it’s a palace"
Make sure take your passport. They asked when buy entrance ticket. Take a all day visit. A lot too see.
"Stunning, booked this as part of a day tour with Tour Beijing. Well worth a visit. The scale of The Purple Forbidden City (full title) and all its marble bridges is astounding. I cannot do it justice on here. Then when you think you have finished in the austere surroundings you go into the imperial gardens , full of huge trees and pavilions and birds singing, complete contrast between emperor's business and pleasure. This really needs 2-3 hours to see it all."
"This is one place no one who is a lover of history would like to miss at least once in a life time .
Build in that age you cant imagine and always step of exploration gives one that thought ,,, how ?"
This place of course is a must when you visit China. However prepare to see very big crowds. The museum shop offers very good deals for quality gifts!
We visited this place during convention in beijing. So there are many guards and soldiers that make us rushing to move and difficult to enjoy this place. But if you're in beijing never skip this place
"We had high expectations for this place thinking it would be amazing inside. We were very disappointed.

It is very big but most of it is boring grey concrete. The halls inside are ok but once you have seen the first one they are all pretty similar.

We have been to Bangkok and seen the temples there and were expecting the same but this place was not even comparable. Worth a visit if u have not seen something like this before but we walked through in about an hour as it got boring.

We felt sorry for the Concubine who used to have to live there and never leave!!

We saw the Summer Palace, Temple of Heaven, Great Wall, Tinanmen Square and this was by far the most disappointment of the lot."
"A great day tour through the Forbidden City with Han Tang International Travel Service which also included Tiananmen Square, Temple of Heaven and the Summer Palace. It was mad even better by the fantastic energy provide by our guide Jackie who provide an excellent running commentary on all the history and the facts about the sights we visited. All with a great sense of humor. Thank you Jackie for making our tour much fun."
"This is a huge area, with lots of tourist .I like this place though although we only see a few places inside but it is good enough for me as the weather is awesome. Beware of the public toilet though, you will be suprise"
"Wear comfy shoes as this place is big! Another must is a guide or self guided audio tour. Finding out little details such as that the paving is not one layer deep as per normal, but around 1.5 metres deep makes the experience far more meaningful. Make the effort to climb the stairs up to the level of the buildings as the view is much more enjoyable than from the ground, which becomes boring as the 'concrete' coloured paving and no vegetation can become a bit overwhelming."
This location has been on my list for a while. We had a guide for the day and I believe it was good as you need to have reserved tickets a day in advance for this attraction when we were visiting. The entire city is huge and is a long walk for little ones. Upstairs and down stairs many times. Very interesting for adults!
We had an excellent guides on our tour who knew the answers to all our questions. I'd seen many TV programmes about The Forbidden City and it exceeded my expectations.
We arrived here at the opposite end of Ti'anamen square with our guide. The sun was shining but we had no idea the long walk ahead of us. The numerous temples and buildings were very impressive but honestly became repetitive after the 4th as we tried to overcome the masses of other visitors. Its a must see if you are in Beijing but maybe arrive a little more prepared than we did - take plenty water.
It's an amazing place to visit. Takes about 4 hours to take the full circuit and we enjoyed each moment of it. It's amazingly clean and the buildings have been very well maintained. Amazing architecture of the olden times. was the palace of the Chinese kings. One can take the gps connected e guide. Available at the entry points. Costs 40 yuan. A must visit if in Beijing.
"With over 8700 rooms, this place was amazing. It gives one a little taste of what the life of an Emperor was like. Be prepared to walk a lot. The artistry of the buildings is amazing. The garden area is a peaceful area to relax. We picked up an automated guide available just inside the gates. They are available in multiple languages. Well worth the small price. You will want to pick up a map of the grounds too. There are English versions available too. Enjoy your stroll through this amazing piece of history."
Wear comfortable shoes as you are about to go in a huge property with every corner of it different. You would want to see every bit of it.
"A massive tourist attraction. The tour guide said they limit admittance to 'only' 80,000 per day! Huge place, full of history and lots to see. Well worth the visit!"
"We enjoyed seein the Forbidden City, however before we got there we watched a documentary about it, this helped us understand the history of the place. There was a lot of walking and in many of the buildings there was not much to see. Some of the more impressive exhibits you have to pay more to see once you are inside. The structures and details on the building were impressive. Half a day was more then enough to be inside the walls! Remember to bring toilet paper as most of the public restrooms do not supply it."
"The history of this place is amazing. To think that just not that long ago, you couldn't even visit here is a test of the importance of this place. I was in awe from the time we crossed the bridge to enter until we left. This place is huge so wear comfortable walking shoes. You can't miss this!!!"
Without doubt the must go place in Beijing. The imperial palace in the nation's capital that is rich in history and tradition. The place is huge and can take hours to fully appreaciate the granduer of it all. Best to go early in the morning so as to beat the afternoon crowd.
"The buildings inside the palace are huge over a vast piece of land. The buildings are quite repetitive and found very empty without anything attractive. Skip this in case you are pressed on time. Not worth the 1-2 hours walk inside!

What worsen the situation was the scam around these tourist spot with local Rickshaw guys. These places are flooded with tourists and hence the waiting time for cabs / bus is a lot. While we were in queue waiting for transport, a rickshaw guy came and showed three fingers (stating 3 Yuan). I repeatedly asked him 3 yuan to which he said yes. During the travel on rickshaw, he split two of us into two different rickshaws. They dropped us 5 mins away from our destination and asked 300 Yuan. With all the language issues, they kept insisting and forcing for 300. While we were arguing a local fellow came and tried to understand the situation. We paid 100 Y and left the place. Local cops should do something about this !"
"I was there in spring. So weather was nice.
Remember to have your passport with you as you will need it when you buy the tickets into the Forbidden City.
Consider visiting at late morning and have either an early or late lunch.
This will give you a better opportunity of exploring the place when most people are taking their lunch.
Upon your exit at the north of the city, do cross over to the park across the road.
Take a slow walk up the hill for a bird-eye's view of the forbidden city.

Do take time to read the background and history of each sites or hiring the mobile audio guide, otherwise, the buildings may start to look similar after a while.

If you are on a tight budget and plan to stay longer, do bring so snacks for yourself.
Eateries inside can cost more compared to those outside."
We were lucky to see this place without massive crowds. It really is impressive and with a guide filling in the history it's especially unique.
"It's what everybody going to Beijing wants to see but be warned, there are queues of local tour groups and nothing is written in English. From the moment you get to the ticket barriers be prepared to be jostled, the Chinese aren't bad mannered, they are just used to the crowds.
The Forbidden City is a one way stroll of several kilometres. You cannot turn back so be prepared for a long walk, once you start you cannot stop.
Each square leads to another and each has some building related to where the concubines lived or where the doctors stayed. There are temples and rooms where important business took place but most of the rooms are empty.
By the time we were three quarters of the way through we were tired and bored, it's interesting but if you miss it don't worry. The architecture is interesting and of course everything has a hidden meaning but it didn't 'WOW' me."
Such a historical place! I was really impressed with Beijing's attractions. Forbidden City is so worth visiting.
"So let me just say that without SiSi, our private guide from TopChinaTravel, our trip to the Forbidden City wouldn't have been as wonderful as it was. Her knowledge of the history, her ability to answer all of our random questions and her impressive photography skills made this journey unforgettable. The Forbidden City is quite impressive and wrought with symbolism and fact. Down to the smallest details, it is laden with meaning. SiSi explained everything to us and made it such a fun time for us! I highly recommend finding her through TopChinaTravel for your next trip to the Forbidden City and anywhere else in Beijing that you wish to visit!"
Be prepared for a lot of walking. It is a historic place that shouldn't be missed. You can't go into the building but to be inside the walls is amazing.
We wished we can go into the building but it is off limit now. Still can see the inside from the door opening but lots of people trying to see too. It is not peak season but still lots of people. Cannot imagine how the peak season looks like.
"No sane person would miss the most important landmark of China! The cultural and historical significance of this monument should need no further elaboration.

Long queues and large crowds are to be expected. You can savour the buildings and corridors, but entry into most of the halls are not allowed. To catch a glimpse from the outside, be prepared to shove your way through Chinese tourists all trying to stick their cameras into the air to get a good shot. A good introduction into the Chinese way of life."
Connected to Tiammen square by underground walkway. Amazing place with great history and plenty of displays. I was awed by the size and details of the buildings. The toilets can be kinda scary though.
"As a landmark this place was an amazing one. But lack of information especially in english make this palace feel ""empty"". It is the reason that the most visitor were local only."
"We queued up and went through security at 10am - ticket queue was relatively short and easy. But upon entering Forbidden City, it was awful and unbearable. Too many tour groups, too many tourists who cut queue, shoved and pushed their way through. Could not even find a quiet spot to admire the architecture. This is a must-do whilst in Beijing but you will not be able to enjoy the beauty of Forbidden City when you are shoved and pushed aside. Awful...the authorities have to manage this tourist attraction better."
"We visited the Forbidden City on a clear day with blue skies and couldn't have asked for more! It was lovely and not too crowded (even though it was a Sunday afternoon - they are closed on Mondays).
We got the audio guide which was helpful and interesting and took our time walking around. After an hour or so the kids thought it was a bit ""boring"", but they had a chance to run around the place, which is vast, so it wasn't so much of an issue.
Would definitely recommend it, it's a must see place, full of history, you can almost see yourself transported to the Ming dynasty!"
"This is an impressive place but is very busy with visitor in the weekend, making the crowds huge and it quite impossible to see inside temples."
"I have been here twice. Once on a weekday and once at the weekend. Like day and night. Massive crowds on a sunny Saturday, the place to myself on a cold February Tuesday. Prepare for a crush if coming on a weekend or holiday."
"Amazing, there is so many layers, we were stay there for 2 hours still not enough time to enjoy the scenery, appreciate the old building.. Tips:There always many people, take care your belonging especially travellers from Western. Dont take picture with the police/army you will be scolded.

To many people, but you will enjoy the infrastructure and historical. Dnt forget to touch the Door for Good Luck !"
"Wow! What a facility the Chines constructed to keep the emperor hidden and mystically away from the ordinary folk of China. Now travellers and locals blend into one crowd to explore the places where once few people were allowed to tread. No Kowtowing, you walk straight in. Dynastic China would be horrified. Beautiful building and architecture blend with views to the modern city. But the scale and magnificence is still over-powering."
"Very beautiful and unique, so much beautiful history to see! All building beautifully built and hand painted!"
Really amazing but dress warmly with sensible walking shoes as everything is outdoors and there is quite a bit of marble to walk on which is slippery in the rain.
"Well this is a must visit for any visitor . Takes almost 1 month of being honest to compete . A must for any photographer . If you miss this , you miss China"
"This is living history. It's the story of centuries of people breaking free of Emperors, reshaping tradition, and honoring heritage. It is an invasion into what used to be.. and you feel good doing it."
"Beautiful Place, very easy to get to from the airport, the train is the cheapest option - you can buy your ticket at the entrance. DON'T FALL for the teahouse scam - I hate to say it but be cautious of anyone approaching you being friendly or offering to show you the way, woman mainly who offer to go for a drink with you.
The pollution can also be a problem if you have breathing difficulties."
The walk through this place takes some time and it is right across the road from Tiananmen Square. Both are a must see in Beijing
"Yes, it was just ok for me. The fact that all you see are buildings and not objects, it kind of limits the experience for me. It is worth seeing if visiting Beijing.
Bring your passport with you, as need it to buy your entry ticket. If you are joking a tour, I think the agent will just need your passport number.
My day tour was booked through China travels. They are also affiliated with China highlights.
I much enjoyed my visit to 798 Art Zone compared to the forbidden city."
We enjoyed wandering around the Forbidden City but there are no interpretive signs so you really need a Guide to explain the significance of the area.
"Everything here is just stunning. If you find that you are in Beijing, you must visit this place, just be aware, there are TONS of people!"
"Vast - layers upon layers of walls, courtyards and monumental buildings. No idea left unrealized. 500 years of imperial grandeur."
"To see this is person was unbelievable. The massiveness of the whole place is beyond belief. I could cheerfully have spent way more time here just poking around. That happens to be the disadvantage of being with a tour, however, that being said, I have to pinch myself to believe that I have really been where all the Chinese history took place."
Cannot begin to describe the grandeur and unbelievable scale of this place. Breathtaking! Couldn't possibly fully explore all the many aspects of this amazing tribute to Chinese history. Simply captivating. If you really want a good appreciation of the scale and layout of the forbidden city go into Jingshan Park and climb to the top of the hill. The views over every part of Beijing are stunning.
Maybe with a better understanding of the cultural significance it would have meant more. Crowds of Chinese were pushing & shoving to see inside some of the temples but we weren't sure what was so exciting. They looked bare and dusty to us! As I said - we should possibly have been better informed.
"In China there's a meaning for everything, symbols, buildings, plants, people - surreal, fascinating; literally taken back in time. Crowds intense but OK for young and old alike though watch your step! Tour guide a definite bonus, prices are cheap so it's mad not to do it and learn the culture of history of this great empire. Do not miss this!"
"Words cannot describe this attraction. You have to go and see it yourself. The grounds are mammoth and there is historical significance in every corner. It is crowded but it is so big that you can choose to walk off the path of most people and get some sense of the tranquility that emperors enjoyed.

Really a can't miss sight for young and old alike"
"Amazing , the detail and workmanship of construction on it's own is simply hard to grasp how this was achieved in the era it was built , a narrated tour to understand the reasons for each area was insightful , a must"
"This ancient city in the center of Beijing was the home of many emperors. The entire city is surrounded by high walls, like a fortress, and is extremely large and requires quite a bit of walking. The numerous buildings are mostly all made from wood and access to these buildings is prohibited. You can view the interiors through large glass windows, which only provides a small section of the interiors. Recommend hiring a guide prior to entering the city, if you do not already have one. There are many knowledgeable students providing quide services for an hourly fee. It takes about two hours minimum to walk through the city without spending much time at each site. Without a guide it is difficult to get a good understanding of the history behind this beautiful, ancient, Chinese architectural wonder."
"Go early to avoid crowds. I went in mid march, it was very windy at some points. Not a very long queue for a sunday. The audio guides are not bad, actually I found them useful cause there is no other information available on-site. Be patient with the hordes of locals, their vital space is almost inexistent. Specially at the temples with no entrance allowed, it can be a real challenge get a glance of the interior. Be brave... :)
The gardens are nice.
At the plaza by the water fountain after the security check, a person (""art student"") invited me to a art exhibition, she was trying to sell her paintings, a bit pushy, don't follow them...for sure its a scam!!!"
It was mesmerizing to see the Forbidden City.The lines were not too long and we got to walk around and see the full city.
"Well, this place is very informative with the history. I suggest that you could read up a little before exploring!

It is much more magnificent than one could watch on television! And you will wonder, the emperor must be a super big shot living in here!

Bring food and water as the refreshments are expensive! Water at 5 while snacks are 39!

Time spent: 4 hrs
Cost: 40 yuan"
Majestic on a Grand-scale. Bring good shoes & don't forget your walking legs. Still very cool in March so rug up & carry water.
"Forbidden city locate at north side of Tianmen square. Before enter to Forbidden city need go trough security check which can take a time (there is normally huge amount of local tourists as well). To get ticket, you must bring your passport with you. Ticket office close 15.30 and museum 17.00. Place is huge. so reserve enough time and wear comfortable shoes."
"Buy the all inclusive ticket. Pay extra for the audio tour. The system is a bit quirky but gives a good overview.

The central portion can be done in about 1-1/2 hours. If you do the East and West palaces add a couple of hours.

Set aside 1/2 hour to clear security."
I would go for it if you have just few days in Beijing ;) there are much more beautiful places to see than that huge palace 😯 takes a lot of time to get and walk through it and it just all SAME 😐 after 10 min you feel like you had enough 😂
Loved this spot. So much history and beauty. The grounds are much larger then they appear from the outside. We got lots of beautiful pics and video here.
Having watched the recent TV series 'The Story Of China' prior to embarking on an organised tour I was so excited to be visiting this historical home of all the Emperors & I wasn't disappointed. The buildings have or are all being restored & cover a large area although it does get very busy with tourists so it does feel crowded in places. We had a guide who explained many of the various buildings & their purpose to us as well as providing stories about the various Dynasties who resided there. We were a bit rushed at the end when we walked through the gardens & I would have liked more time there. Well worth a visit.
The Forbidden City was forbidden for so long. Now we all have a chance to see it. Spend the day - it's incredible.
"Tienanmen Square is directly adjacent to the palace, with the iconic gate with the portrait of Chairman Mao on the front. To enter the Palace, you will have to go a series of ""thorough"" security checks. Prepare for a very long queue to get through the security.

When you enter through the first gate with Chairman Mao, you are not actually in the City. You will go through a series of tree-lined courtyards before you hit another gate, where you will be asked to produce tickets and go through additional security checks. Then, you have finally entered the Forbidden City.

The grandeur and beauty of the palace goes without saying. The massive crowds are also to be expected for a major attraction like this. Crowds will be unbearable, especially near the three main Halls (Hall of Supreme Harmony, Hall of Central Harmony, Hall of Preserving Harmony). A friend of mine only managed to take one blurry picture of the Emperor's throne in the Hall before being jostled away by the massive crowds. If you can resist not taking pictures, this would be an excellent idea at the more crowded spots. There aren't many spots in the world where I feel the crowds did not detract from the experience; this is one of those few exceptions. I thoroughly enjoyed my visit here, despite the hordes of people visiting (though it would have been better if less crowded). Being afraid of crowds should not discourage you from visiting an amazing historical spot like this.

Providing a more perhaps ""intimate"" experience is the Dowager Empress' private residence within the City. You get to see inside her personal residence, giving you a clearer idea of how life really was like living in Forbidden City. It was crowded as well, but I enjoyed it in contrast to the massive, obnoxiously grand halls of the main parts of the City.

Despite the immense size of the palace, I actually would not recommend visiting for more than a day trip (i.e. multiple days). Jostling through the crowds and seeing similar guard houses, buildings, etc. might get tiring and a bit dull. Just visit the highlights of the City, and you will be more than satisfied. We only visited for a couple of hours and that was adequate.

This is a must-visit in China; in the world, for that matter. If you can go, by all means, GO! Just be prepared for the crowds."
"We heard that the queue will be very Long and rowdy to buy the entrance tickets. But it is obviously not so when we visit. There are numerous ticketing counters opened and there was only one couple ahead of us when we were there. Remember to bring your passport though as the security checks might need it. It is also easily accessible with the subway. There is a queue to go through for security checks though, but the queue is very orderly. Also, note that the museum is closed on Mondays.

Do not be misleaded by the crowds at the entrance area, once inside the palace, the people spread out. It is not more crowded than Disneyland or universal studios.

Once inside, the palace is impressive with 9999 palaces and halls within. Some of them have exhibits within. The only crowded areas are where crowds form to look at the ""emperor's seat"" where his officials seek their audience with him in the main halls. One day is not enough though. We spent one day here but think we covered only 40% without spending time to take photos or such."
Basically just a long walk with nothing much to see. Same looking bldg over and over with same basic looking room. They will take your lighters so don't bring any if they are expensive.
"I knew a little of the history of the Forbidden City before I came, and I'd seen pictures, but nothing prepared me for the vastness of this place. While English kings were lording it over their subjects from small castles, China's emperors were living in vast town-sized constructions. The interior can get a bit samey, and the Summer Palace is much more varied, but it's still worth visiting."
"We thoroughly enjoyed our visit today albeit by default. We actually set out for Tiananmen Square and went through the security there and ended up at Forbidden City! The two are obviously next to each other and as we were going tomorrow it was ok. There was a very big crowd and the Chinese are very used to pushing, shoving and jostling you so you must have to accept that is there nature and take it easy. The sights are impressive and the area incredibly vast. Plenty of amazing photo opportunities however to get the best ones move into areas by the side rather then staying on the central pathways. Steeped in history we also enjoyed just sitting back and soaking up the past whilst talking about what life must have been like in that era. Priced at 40rmb and kids (school age and under 6 is free) at 20rmb it is exceptional value for an incredible place to visit."
"A big tourist attraction with up to 80,000 people visiting a day. Be prepared to walk a lot and see lots of building. The audio machine is worthwhile and best for non Chinese speaking visitors. plenty to see including clock collection and antiques."
"Definitely worth the visit. It's like Disneyworld to anyone interested in cultural heritage. It's a vast complex with 999 buildings (not all open to he public). The architecture alone is amazing. You need good walking shoes as it can be tiring, and it's stunning on bright sunny days with no smog. You won't be able to see everything (exhibits, interiors etc.) in one visit, but try to soak up the atmosphere."
very interesting and unique place full of ghosts and much larger than I had imagined..very well organised but very relaxed..take your walking shoes or use the golf buggies available...
"Absolutely stunning, It amazes me how somebody can build a 10,000 rooms palace. The Emperors had the great life. It is a highlight of the cultural experience while visiting Beijing China."
Nice to see the forbidden city. Can't go inside the buildings to see it. Just walk around on the outside. Cost 40 entrance free as far as I remember. Very busy place with tourists. Travelled in March.
"Terrible is not bad enough to describe this attraction. There are 9999 rooms, of total nothing-ness. Acres of empty temples. If you are expecting to visit here to marvel at exotic historical relics, you are in the wrong place, because Mao destroyed everything ancient in the Cultural Revolution. There is nothing to see here. We could have been out in half an hour. The highlights : 2 or 3 temples are furnished in Victorian era furniture. Access is limited to peering in from the outside, through perspex, whilst jostling for position with tens of thousands of Chinese with selfie sticks. There is a garden, woo hoo, but didn't come here to see gardens. And there is a tiny exhibition, which is in a room above your head as you walk in the main portal, not well sign posted, so you will probably miss it. Don't worry, its probably full of fakes anyway. Trust me, don't believe the other reviews that say its fascinating in here, its nonsense. Its an empty shell. Go somewhere else for the day. Your time is precious."
"We did the Forbidden City in the afternoon and were lucky that it was open to the public! If you can afford it I would recommend you take a (an audio) guide - we didnt - also because we were in a rush, but there are so many things worth receiving an explenation..."
"The sheer size of the place will take your breath away. A fitting home for an emperor. Extremely impressive, stunning colours and beautifully maintained buildings. Interesting exhibits, good facilities. A must-see on any visit to Beijing."
"For ¥40 to allow yourself the best part of a day for exploration at the very heart of Běijīng, the Forbidden City is China’s largest and best-preserved collection of ancient buildings, and the largest palace complex in the world. So called because it was off limits for 500 years, when it was steeped in stultifying ritual and Byzantine regal protocol, the otherworldly palace was the reclusive home to two dynasties of imperial rule until the Republic overthrew the last Qing emperor. Today, the Forbidden City is prosaically known as the Palace Museum and most Chinese people simply call it Gù Gōng (故宫; ancient palace). A place with lots of history and really huge. Do bear in mind this place need lots of walking."
"We went here for around 2.5-3 hours, to see as much as we did in this time frame we had to move pretty quick. Some sections were closed for renovation (didnt see anything stating this on the website). We also missed on a section due to them closing the entrance earlier than the rest of the museum (15:30). I think 3-4 hours would be enough time to spend inside the museum. We got the audioguide which gave some interesting info as we walked. I think this place is definitely worth seeing and it is close to some others so i would plan a day in this area of Beijing, head out the north gate at the end and walk up to the temple you see for some great views of the whole museum."
Lots to look at here - think a private tour guide would be very helpful but for us we do like to wander on our own - however you would obviously get far more out of this place having someone tell you the history and meaning of buildings
"Remember to bring ur passport or picture ID. You cannot get into The Forbidden City without it. They have an audio tour that is fine, however if you enjoy learning details and history you may want to have an actual tour guide."
"This too is a must do activity in Beijing, beware though our guide claimed 50,000 visit this site daily in low season, this claim was certainly backed up during our visit.. Plenty of security checks to go through as part of the tour."
You will need a passport in order to buy tickets . It was very busy. Lots of Asian and other groups slowing you town.
"The Forbidden City and Tian’anmen Square are very near. You can take the subway # 1 in tiananmen west or tiananmen east to get off.Now listed as a World Heritage site, the imperial palace complex of Beijing’s Forbidden City was home to ruling emperors for nearly 500 years after its completion in 1420.WOW, what a big home!The ticket is very cheap,only ￥40/adult."
"Rich in history and huge! Almost overwhelmingly fun but I hope you don't mind walking because you will do a lot of it.
Great place to experience."
"Was on a tour at the Forbidden City, lots of walking but lots of great History to see and feel. Very big area, if taking this site in make sure you take a snack with you to save on money and lots of water. Be sure to take in the Tinanamen Square first then it flows to the City and after is Jingshan Park climb to top to see all of Beijing City."
"When they refer to a city we think of cities as they are now, but go back a long time and this certainly would have been a huge city to country dwellers then. I was quite suprised how large the Forbidden City was as I went from building to building and courtyard to courtyard. It certainly is very well worth seeing and should be a part of your itinerary especially if you have not seen many old Chinese buildings.The place was very busy and I am told its very busy in the summer, but there is plenty to see for all and some fascinating views, buildings and objects to view. Where did they find so many large straight trees for the buildings and hhow did they get them there."
It was best to see the City on our own so we could wander and linger. It is one of those places you almost have to see once and the many little off the tour guided path are interesting.
"WOW!!!!!!!! If you want an EXPERIENCE, go on a tour of Beijing China! WOW! the Forbidden City is amazing; in size, in architecture, in detail; stone work, etc.....and don't forget the 5 Star western style toilets! (not kidding) a must for western visitors..... the history of the City is so vast, intricate, laced with mystery and intrigue, you don't want your guide to stop talking! We were a Viking Cruise tour and spent several days in Beijing and visited many places; this is one keeper......it takes most of the day but it is worth every minute. you will see the Hugh meeting rooms to the smallest sleeping areas; all built with such detail you will wonder how they accomplished it all! Wonderful!!!!!"
"Not only are the buildings and the whole structure amazing, but the other visitors were too. Friendly, curious and fun, wanting their photos taken with us and joking around with us despite them speaking Chinese, and us English. Great experience!

The size and grandeur of the Forbidden City is spell-binding. The ceramic detail on the roof tops, the bright paint work on the undersides, the cobblestones, big old doors, huge plazas for want of a better word - all, just very very captivating.

We were there late winter/early spring with very few visitors compared to summertime. Very cold wind whistling around so wrap up warm if you're going at a similar time.

We didn't get the audio guide so missed out on learning much of the history and hearing the stories. There aren't many info displays really so would be a good idea to get an audio guide if you want some background info or do your reading beforehand. We were happy to mooch, mingle and take in the vibe of the place. Halls, pavilions, gardens, palaces, gates and chambers galore!

Think it was about 2.5km from one end to the other so what with meandering, it was probably closer to a 5km or more walk for us!

There are a few toilets inside...not heaps but a few. Not many refreshment options so be sure to take some water and take every opportunity to sit down - not many places for a rest."
Our tour group spent 3 hours walking from one end to the other but still didn't see everything. An amazing 72 ha (180 acres) I never realised how big it was.
"Brilliant place, steeped in history and huge! It took us about 3 hours to get through it. When you come out at the end, make sure to go to Jingshan Park just across the street and climb up to the pavillion (10 mins) to take in the view over the Forbidden City and the whole of Beijing itself.

Do not bother with the GPS audio guides, they're expensive and don't work properly! Also, make sure you eat before as the food once inside is vile and expensive!"
"Excellent !....
Hard walking but worth visiting !.
Go guide tour with excellent explanations on each area....
We booked a taxi to avoid delays, was very impressed with this tourist attraction.

You should definitely find the time to visit !."
"The Forbidden City is the original place where the royals would live. It is called forbidden since the average Joes like you and me would not be let in. It is really large - walking fast with sporadic picture taking will take you 2h at least. Most buildings look identical so after seing the same thing for the 10th time you may be fed up so it's good to pay extra for the audio guide (provided in few languages) as it will show you where you are on the map and also give you a brief history of the place, information on who lived where, how the buildings were restored and all the interesting trivia that you'll like to tell your mates once you're back from China. I do not know how much it costs as I was lucky to have the sight seeing provided to me by my Chinese host."
"This is a must see for any visitor to China. The palace is a vast complex which requires a full day to see and appreciate, even at a basic level. It is always crowded and expect, as a European visitor, to be asked to have your photo taken with other Chinese tourists. this is not scam; most people visiting will not have encountered white Europeans before so expect to be seen as a novelty item"
Absolutely amazing place to see. Very busy so keep close to your fellow travellers as it's very easy to get separated. The history and little touches such as the glistening gold statues on the roof are wonderful.
"A trip to Beijing would not be complete without a tour of Forbidden City. It covers a large area and you need to allocate enough time (better part of a day) to see it. Most of the area is outdoors so the weather plays an important part of your visit. The various galleries and exhibits are small compared to other American or European cultural sites, but they are very interesting. The crowds are quite large and often you have to jostle to get a view. The smaller alcoves and palaces have less crowds and can be more enjoyable.."
"I specifically recommend looking at newly released art works that will open to the public. This is one of the most frequently visited places in China so come early as the lines can be long. I recommend bringing a camera too. There are various VIP tours coming through. One time we were there when the prime minister of a small European country was there. Half the museum closed. However, other times the museum should be available so careful planning is advised as this museum has quite a following."
"It was very crowded in parts, and a bummer not to be able to go inside the buildings, but we enjoyed seeing and learning about the times gone by and seeing the historical structures."
"When you are in Beijing - you have to see Forbidden City, if you haven´t seen it - you haven´t seen Beijing. It is such huge Museum and it is a lot of historical heritage there. But try to do it out of tourist season, other way you will see only crowds of tourists there..."
"I found the sheer scale quite amazing but was not over impressed with the cities beauty. The buildings were all the same, too many people and nothing amazing to look at. However at the exit there is a hill one can walk up for 2rmb, do it, do worse it. The city from top is just incredible just by it's size. The view is great from the top"
"This Tian An Men Square consist of Forbidden city, National Museum, Maoseleum of Chairman Mao, Congress Parliament Building. This area would take about min. 3 hours to complete viewing. No words could describe one the grandest palace. Just go and see it."
"I went with a friend who was visiting and it was a dreary day and the line was long, but orderly. We could only glimpse Tiananmen Square and the Tomb of Mao was not open.
Once in (there will be people trying to get you to visit other sites or offer tour guide services...politely say no and walk on by), it's VAST! And you keep moving forwarding to even more open areas and courtyards and building. Pay attention to the colors high on the roof overhangs. And there are dragon boats coming off the roof tile corners. Loved this. Dragon statues everywhere. There isn't much to see in the buildings as most of them are closed. As you keep moving back towards the exit, there is a lovely garden...the highlight in my opinion. After you depart, take some time to find a hutong (local community) and walk around a bit or find a place to eat."
"Amazingly huge - about a mile from Tiananmen Gate to the north exit. This was the emperor's palace of imperial China and you get a feeling of the ceremonial duties which were so important for the imperial household to carry out to ensure China's success. Exquisitely decorated buildings. You need at least half a day to make the most of your visit. I cannot find words to describe how magnificent this museum is.
Be prepared for a long slow walk!
You absolutely must see this."
There are so many palaces to see. But they close and not allow people to enter in each palace. They also don't turn on the light so u can't see much of inside from the door. U also have to compete with Chinese tourists in order to see and I did give up for that.
"Just an average visit nothing to get worked up about,security to much although big conference on in tianemen square,may have been the reason."
"Its a must see. Very large, not easily described. Understand not allowing visitors in door, but was really disappointed when we wouldn't walk inside. Also disappointed artifacts and treasures weren't on display. (But understand)."
"You visit Beijing to see this. This is the main attraction in the city. It is spectacular. Lots of people, it will be overwhelming. Spend at-least half day. Must see"
"Disappointed with my visit to the forbidden city - I found the level of security at the front to be excessive and spent a very long time queueing only to have to go through the same thing again another hundred meters further down the road.

I find it absolutely incredulous that you can't go into the museum without having your passport on you, there's no advance warning of this so if, like me, you lock your valuables in your hotel safe you're only seeing half of what there is at the forbidden city due to Chinese bureaucracy."
Plan at least half a day. The place is huge. There was a crowd of people at opening at 830 so don't feel overwhelmed and be prepared for a little squeezing and shoving at least in the beginning. Very interesting history here.
"Absolutely amazing a must see, words can't describe the vastness of it !
Be prepared for large crowds as it can be very busy"
"Glad we went in winter, it was freezing, still a lot of people, but you could look around in comfort, we had a private tour guide, its an amazing place to see, I love the history and there is so much of it here, well worth the look"
"First off, I want to indicate this review is specifically for the Hall of Clocks within the Palace Museum. I did not visit the other sections so I cannot comment on them.

I do not think I have seen such an assortment of (mostly European) clocks in my life, and some of them had amazing movements. Many of the clocks were hundreds of years old, but a few also dated to the early 20th century.

Two trends arise quickly while viewing the clocks, however. First, I don't recall any of the clocks actually functioning or moving anymore, so don't expect to see any of the complex movements in action. Second, for such a prized collection of timepieces, you would think the museum would either hire someone to clean or better seal the clocks to keep dust out. Many of the clocks had visible layers of dust on them, which would make any conservator twitch and shudder. I get the patina, but there's not much excuse to allow so much dust to accumulate!

There are English signs within the museum, and each clock has a brief description, usually indicating its age, origin, and in some cases manufacturer. There isn't any information for most of their clocks indicating their provenance.

If antique timepieces are you thing, it's worth a visit. Otherwise, you may find yourself underwhelmed."
"This was my third time visiting the forbidden city.
It is fascinating to hear the story of the emperors as you walk among the historic buildings.
The grounds are quite large so reserve a few hours to explore."
"I've never seen a perfect city centre than the Forbidden City Palace in the heart of Beijing. It's an awesome construction with end less number of doors opening as we walk inside.

Those travelling with young children can carry the stroller here, however the tires have to be good otherwise they will get worn out in no time due to uneven surfaces inside.

To really appreciate the beauty of this palace, get an aerial view of it from the Jingshan Park which is towards the north end of the Palace Museum. As per our tour guide, the moat was constructed around the Palace and the remains of digging the moat were piled up and it formed a hill on which the Jingshan Park is built. Awesome!"
"This was an attraction that had to be done, I couldn't believe how vast the area was, it seemed to go on for ever, very interesting but can be very crowded and just peering into open windows can take time to get to the front, the audio is the best way to do the tour which you can do at your own pace. My favourite part was the Clock museum that was definitely not to be missed."
"Truly unmissable!! You can easily imagine what it would've been like centuries ago. This is an all-day affair, and you will need a guide. Guides are essential to explain each of the Halls and Gates, what they were used for, and they explain the architecture and put everything into context. Most of your time will be spent outside, so a hat, handheld fan (for Beijing's infamous humidity) good walking shoes and large bottle of water are necessary. The site covers 72ha and while the entrance and grounds are flat, if you want to go into any of the buildings you need to climb a few flights of stairs. Because this is a historical site, there are no toilets, shops or any other amenities once you get inside. Don't forget to check out all the artifacts and paintings, and don't forget to look UP! The ceilings are so intricate and beautiful!"
"We were in Beijing, so we took the subway and made our way to the Forbidden City. We went early in the day so it was not so crowded, but as the morning wore on the crowds grew. The buildings were interesting, the smaller courtyards and gardens we enjoyed more. The walk back to the subway was somewhat unsettling but we made it.
A once in a lifetime event, glad we did it but don't need to go back"
A very special place and one not to be missed on any tour of China takes up most of the day and good weather is needed to get the most out of your visit suggest early in the season when things are a little quieter.
It is one of the must visit places in Beijing according to most of the websites but its a palace with not much amazing things inside just similar style building all along and please be aware of a huge crowd of local & foreign tourists also need to show your valid id to get a ticket
"As a family we really liked walking through the Forbidden City. It was definitely a worthwhile visit, we didn't have time to go in the museum as our toddler was tired. It is very true that locals will pay a lot of attention to young blonde children, our 20 month old daughter received lots of attention as it was really busy but we were prepared for that."
What an interesting place and should be done with a guide as there is so much history here that you need someone to explain it all. Lots and lots of people but worth the effort
"Part of a tour package takes me to the Forbidden City along with a few other sites, great to marvel in the history of the place and it is kept in pristine condition, nice to spend a morning walking around on a nice day. Cant take photo's of the guards so be careful, otherwise you are free to roam around at your own pace."
if you love to walk then this is the place. all the tourist go so i also went. but i didn't find anything extrodinary probably because i have seen very histotrical places. structure and the story is all the same for the 8 palaces in there.
"This was a wonderful place to tour. Lots of history, lots to see. Throngs of people. Beware a lot of pushing and shoving to see inside the temples, they you can only look in, but not go in. Having a guide provided us not only the view, but a great deal of the history regarding the culture, the dynasties and the architecture at the same time. Garden is a sight to behold."
"as an exchange student in beijing, i was ""eligible"" to purchase student tickets at 20yuan ~ USD 3 (full price tix 40yuan). Sometimes, the ticket office was reluctant to sell me student tix as they insisted that i have to show my china identiy card (which duh... i do not have since i am a foreigner). However, this is inconsistent, as sometimes i was able to purchase my student tickets with no issue, as long as i show my student ID. I visitied the museum several times with different group of friends and when my sister visited me in china.

While some places are crowded with tourists (most horrible being spots at the throne room, where everyone wants to snap a picture of the emperor's seat) the many galleries in the museum are rather peaceful, where you can take your time to look at the countless artifacts and collections of the museum.

It is hard to find food and drinks in the museum, though there are a few kiosks that offer overpriced snacks and drinks. bring your own water."
"I read about the scam, so was prepared. I was there 5 minutes and was approached by a young pretty Chinese girl who is learning English. Told her I was not interested. The saw just after the main entrance about 8 girls waiting in a small group looking for tourist. Saw a fellow being approached and warned him and the girl got angry. The sad part is there is police and military every where and they do nothing. As a tourist I was asked several times.

The when you leave and visit the square, young male students wanting to practice English want to sell you art? It's insane. I wanted to spend a few days but left, it ruined the experience for me, sad because of the beauty and history"
"What a stunning place. With the trees in bud, this huge palace is something else and stretches one kilometre from gate to final temple. Beautifully renovated and easy to stroll around, just superb."
Very big all for one guy lol but liked it was good to walk around and get the pictures everyone knows of this large complex I enjoyed it (even though was a little cool today)
Interesting but not a bucket list type thing. Very crowded with lots of pushing and shoving around the views. Worth seeing but not a must see
"Lily's tour of the city was awesome, we went into area's other tourist did not go. Special views of concubine chambers. Excellent history detail of the early Chinese dynasty."
When you first walk up to the forbidden city it looks small but once you get in there it is large lots of walking but worth it.
Go back in time exploring this city. The scale of something so old is unbelievable. Check opening times as gates open late and close early to the public. Do this trip with a guide if you can or otherwise purchase the walkabout radio self guide at the the entrance. Try to combine this tour with a visit to Tiananmen Square.
"As a fan of Disney movies, ""Mulan"" came to mind as we walked around. This is an attraction that a visit of a few hours, a day, or even a few days will not do justice. Every time you turn a corner there is something else to explore. It seems to go on forever. This is Chinese history and lots of it."
After so many movies and pictures it was nice to experience personally this part of history.Nothing really impressive to be honest but absolutely worth a couple of hours visit
This is one cool place but wear comfy shoes. Better to go during the week and not the weekend. Weekend is packed. Worth getting a local guide for information.
Most buldjngs are closed. What's cool about visiting is the sheer size and past history. It's not blow away amazing but you should see it if your in town.
"What a palace.... I'd have loved to be a resident of this place.

Well worth the walk - be prepared to walk, a lot. The architecture is beautiful, the palace is lovely and it's HUGE. The only place I went to in China which was crowded, but because it's so large, you don't feel it as much. It was so big and tiring that we skipped some parts and asked the guide for a short break.

We went in the summer, in the afternoon, after doing a walk around Tiananmen Square, so were already tired. I recommend timing it better and either going when the weather is good, or the sun is not too harsh!"
"Forbidden City is the must see place for anyone at least once in your life time. It is the biggest palace in the world with more than 700,000 sq.m and 9,999 rooms. The Forbidden City is the heart of China when the country was rule by the Emperor for more than 500 yeas. The Architecture is the combination of the architecture during Ming's Dynasty and Ching Dynasty, the last dynasty in China. If you want to have best short of Foridden City visit also Jingshan Park on the top of the mountain there, it is the best spot to take photo of the Forbidden City."
"I enjoyed seeing it, and the intricate architecture and gardens were impressive. I missed a lot of the artifacts because I never saw a gallery to go inside; only doors to peer in from the outside. I'll have to go back someday!"
I had a special tour of the entire Forbidden City provided by a friend's niece that worked at the Forbidden City. It is wonderful to see the history and the culture. It is huge and you should allow 3-4 hours to see everything.
"This incredible museum is a series of huge walled compounds each with its own gateway and fabulous buildings. When it was the emperors palace, and forbidden to enter, it was home to over 3000 people.

When busy it can be difficult to get close to some of the main attractions and in photographing anything you will probably include dozens of other visitors in your pictures.

Needless to say it's fascinating, impressive and vast. Definitely worth getting a guide to explain some of the complexities of Chinese society in its heyday and not expensive."
"It was too crowded. By 10 am they were sold out of 80000 tickets and we couldn't go in. Word of advice, go very early!"
Recommend hiring a guide to give history details. The little facts and figures make it all the more interesting. Can't get into a lot of the rooms and overcrowded but stunning exterior and interesting story behind the buildings and those that lived there.
"The Forbidden City is a necessary stop in Beijing. The complex is impressive even to those who dislike history and architecture. It is, however, a large time commitment, especially when coupled with Tiananmen Square. Be ready for a lot of walking, a lot of pictures, and a lot of people!"
We were quite disappointed as it was just big courtyards with Chinese buildings which went on and on and nothing much in them. You are not allowed inside most of them and we thought it would be more like an old fashioned city. Should have done more research!
"Amazing, an absolute must for those visiting Beijing. Take a guide or someone to explain you the history!"
This is a must see place in Beijing and in China. Make sure you book your tickets in advance on the web so you do not need to queue.
I is amassing the buildings and learning all about what the buildings were for and who lived where the day I was there the monks were praying which was interesting to see
"I would recommend you go first to Jingshan Park next door. The temple at the top of the hill gives you a panoramic overview of the whole of the Forbidden City and Tiananmen Square beyond, and gives you an appreciation of the scale of the place.
It is made up of a number of massive gates in line ( Five, I think), with numerous buildings, gardens and courtyards surrounding them - and massive squares between each gate. Each has its own story and significance. My only gripe is that you cannot enter these gates and you are reduced to squinting through windows, in competition with everybody else there, to try to catch a glimpse of the treasures and interesting artefacts inside. There is no ambient lighting inside, so you basically can't see anything. This does not, however, take away from the magnificent buildings themselves."
Good to spend a few hours touring. Some nice grounds/buildings. Could do with a bit of TLC. As you'd expect it's very busy. Historically very impressive - my audio guide only worked half the time so I couldn't understand what all the buildings were.
"I really enjoyed this visit. I found it interesting and informative. I particularly enjoyed the history and the way emperors tried to engage with people. I discovered the Palace is not necessarily ancient but the layout is ancient and we found it fascinating. Do not engage in buying art there as I made that mistake, it is all a bit of a scam. I was sold a picture by a lady who lectured in art at Beijing university well that was what she said. There are some good, inexpensive, nice quality souvenirs to be had if you do want to buy something"
"It will took a full day if you want to finish the whole palace. Is huge and every hall are quite apart.

We can only managed to done less than half of the palace. It was interesting checking out different halls in between and the clock and watches exhibition hall display the most magnificent time artpiece with great craftmsnship, mostly are gifts from European friends of the emperor, so is quite historical european style.

Particularly we are interest to check out the red wall and a well.
There was a story about the prince's underground girlfriend alively got drown by the queen, as she doesnt accept their relationship.

Rumours been said for a decade that people still hear her crying. Besides, leaning to that specific red wall can listen to the ancient emperor's speech during thunder, according to that special reddish concrete made from previous dynasty have a fuction trapping sound til now, with the thunder effect for the chemical reaction. And few of my local bejingers mates told me to check these out when they know my visit here on a rainning thunder day.
Interesting story and place for our visit.We do enjoyed it, will deffy revisit by chance."
I decided to do the Forbidden City because I thought it was going to be a quick stop see it move on actually it was amazing and massive very interesting and lots to see its a must but if your gonna do it get a taxi or who ever is dropping you make sure there drop you at the south gate.
"Book minimum 4-6 hours and even better whole day. Get guided tour and but guidebook as there is so much to learn and see. It is large territory 900 x 600 meters so you need to prepare for intensive walk. In the certain time you will be overwhelmed by all those palaces and houses, but you need only to do what the names of places suggest eg. stop at Hall of Mental Cultivation or Hall of Tranquil Longevity. I was i the last week of February at week day and it was not much crowd but I heard that summer could be terrible"
"With all due respect to the history of this place and it's tremendous importance to the people of China, as a tourist I found the place a little disappointing. Mostly, it's a series of large courtyards amongst buildings that are closed to the public. I would have loved to know what was inside of some these structures, but they're just closed off and no explanation of the purpose of most of them is offered. In fairness, there are also a number of the buildings that are open and have some fascinating artifacts on display. Still, we spent an awful lot of time exploring the site, and we're glad we did, but I thought a lot more information about daily life in the Forbidden City before the revolution could have been made available. The place was also extremely busy, with thousands of Chinese tourists, making it a little bit of a mob scene.

I'm not saying it wasn't worth the trip to the site or the time we spent there, but just keep your expectations in check."
"After reading many novels and books about life in the palace over many dynasties it was surreal to be visiting. This is a must when visiting Beijing.

We hired the audio tour, it was a bit hit and miss with synching your location and information being provided.

We visited three days after the Chinese NY festivities so it was quite quiet. Given the number of people going through I think they need to do some restoration and upkeep. It is a treasure for China and one that needs to be cared for.

A must visit, it is quiet extraordinary."
"Try to get there off peak to avoid the crowds. Great in winter, when the mote is frozen. Better if you can organise a tour with a knowledgeable guide."
"We went to the Forbidden City in December. We had been really looking forward to it. The reality was not like our expectations. The complex is HUGE. It was interesting, but having been to many sights of historical interest around the world, we were surprised it didn't have ""more"". We thought you would see into the buildings and see how the emperors had lived and how the whole complex had run but it was empty. Some of the buildings had the odd throne, bit even seeing that was hard as you couldn't go inside the building and people crowded at the barriers. I'm assuming when It is very busy in summer you would see nothing. We came out feeling somewhat disappointed. I'm glad we went, but would not be rushing back.

It is one way only and once we exited we found it very very hard to get transport back to our hotel. Again it was also extremely smoggy which is apparently worse in Winter."
The Forbidden City is tremendously large..it would take several weeks to see it all. We were able to see several buildings and a very interesting clocks exhibit.
TV and photos do not do justice to how huge it it is. A sunny but cold winter's day in Beijing really showed it off at its best - maybe the cold weather kept the crowds away. I thought 40 RMB was a very reasonable price
"Outrageously huge palace for one man and his wife, i think this is the ultimate luxury in human history, served by so many servants, protected by thousands of imperial guards, he has his own library, archery range, treasure rooms, summer rooms, garden, and his very own opera house (kind of like his own dvd player). Everything in this imperial property."
"It's crazy to think its limited to 80k people a day. But, the amount of people who come through here is phenomenal. It's almost standing room only and it kind of detracta from the splendour that is the Forbidden City. You can find some quieter spots around the periphery but maybe try getting there early. Make sure you take a walk around the moat."
"Wonderful place, full of history and tradition. You really should have a guide going in, it will make all the difference. It is huge, and easily takes up a whole morning or afternoon, so plan accordingly. Also, sometimes the ticket lines are quite long."
"Limited access to the inside of buildings.

Visited the Forbidden City while on a three week tour of China. Great history and beautiful architecture but limited access to the interior of most buildings. Many of the buildings had a rope or low gate across the entrance so you could only peak in. Many times crowds formed near the entrances and you needed to wait your turn to look in or take a picture.

I completely understand the rationale. They cannot let millions of people parade through these buildings and risk destroying these beautifully preserved pieces of Chinese history.

Great place to visit."
"China certainly do things on a grand scale and a tour of the Forbidden City is the best way to start to understand how much history sits behind this amazing country. Finding the Forbidden City is easy enough, if you're staying in Dongcheng try walking there or if further catch the ever so efficient and cheap subway system. If you are the exit entrance you can take a tuk tuk style taxi to the entrance for around 10-15yuan pp - saves you a bit of a walk - getting in you need either your passport or drivers licence at the ticketing booth - then enter the security line, once through you are free to wander around and take it all in. Take your time walking from courtyard to courtyard as there are uneven steps - some great photo moments! Suggest going around 10ish seeing how you get on at the City, then see if you've got energy left to see Tiananmen Square otherwise do that the next day. Lots of little snack and trinket places outside the exit of the City for some souvenir shopping. A must see in Beijing!"
Crowded at peak times but worth a visit. Stunning views and easy to reach from tiannamen square. Lots of photo opportunities
"I you walk into the museum with a guided recoded tour from Roger Moore, the epitome of British gentlemen, and 1 of the greatest Bonds ever, and the action never stops from there! I kept playing back the info cuz I cudnt believe my ears and eyes- a feast for the senses!"
Its huge. Living in Beijing I take friends each time they visit. Having been 5 or so times I always seem to take a different path and see something new. It is always very very crowded though with locals and foreigners alike. I have come to view the crowds as part of the experience for both me and my friends.
"Beautiful and well preserved, a place full of history. Everything has its own story, from the pillars holding the ceiling( 400 yr old trees) to the golden ceilings. A must when in Beijing."
"The Forbidden City is world famous and rightly so, it's an ENORMOUS complex with several huge buildings & courtyards, but also with smaller, but still interesting architecture, down its nooks & crannies. At the end there is a garden to relax in, if you're lucky enough to find a seat given the crowds. We went there early, and on a weekday, to try to avoid the worst of the crowds, but it still fills up fast!"
"I went here on the 2nd day of Lunar New Year at about 10:30 and managed to get in despite how busy it was. If you go, bear in mind that you have to go through security and walk all the way through Tiananmen square to get to it so it can take 30 minutes to get to the ticket desk. The place is huge. I went to all the temples including those on the side and spent about 5 hours there. Some of the structures are magnificent. If you are going alone I wouldn't recommend going to the restaurant as you need a table number which is impossible to get and order your food."
This place has a lot of people. A lot of pushing. Watch your belongings. It is beautiful. Plan to walk a lot. There are a lot of things to see and take pictures of. It is a huge place. You have to walk under a road to get to part of it.
"I found this to be of the ""must see"" places in Beijing. You've seen pictures of the entrance on TV, movies, magazines - the main entrance is the big building with the picture of Mao prominently displaced. My personal suggestion is to go on your own and if you want to learn more about the Forbidden City - hire one of the local tour guides that will almost certainly approach you offering their service. Plan on a minimum of a couple hours here."
"Be ready to check your bags before you enter the security line. Don't worry about your stuff, it will be protected and returned to you promptly after you leave the Palace Museum. Once in the museum, you will see rooms where meetings of the statesmen were held. There are also beautiful views of Tienamen square from the balcony."
Forbidden city is a wonderful creation one must see in a lifetime. The enormity cannot be described in words!!! Be prepared to spend an entire day at least.
"Quick Points:
-Go early (You'll get to watch the flag raising in Tianmen square if you're quite early)
-Entrance is not in Tianmen square, but across the street under the giant picture of Mao
-There will be other exhibits within the museum that will require more RMB to enter, but they are optional

More details:
My husband and I got there at about 6:30am and were a little confused at first at where the line for entering actually started, because each morning they do a flag raising ceremony in Tianmen Square. Once we figured it out we were able to enter the giant courtyard where the ticket booths were. They open at about 8:30, so we waited in line for a bit, but were among the first to explore the museum. Apparently, they only let in 80,000 people per day, so if you plan on going during peak season, it would be good to get there early.

We also used the automated guide (available in about 50 different languages, costing 40 RMB) - I listened and conveyed the interesting things to my husband. The guide would give information on who lived where and interesting legends behind some of the characters. It would also point out architectural differences or highlights to notice and explain the meaning behind them. There are signs available at most stops and on almost every display case in both Chinese and English that will briefly explain an object or building.

When we went it was quite cold being the end of their winter season. They do have heated treasure and art galleries that you can warm up in as well as a restaurant that has good soup and very hot coffee.

As far as crowdedness goes, it was probably a 7-8 out of 10 for China. Even with it being a cold day, there were plenty of people there. The crowds will be around most of the main buildings and in the treasure galleries (also to get warm).
The experience as a whole was great. We took our time and spent 7 hours there (with warm-up breaks every so often). It's been a while since I'd taken Chinese history, but it was crazy to realize/be reminded that dynasties still ruled on into the 20th century! I loved seeing the cool architecture, where and how people would have lived. Even just the grandness of the palace was incredible. My husband went back and walked the length of it straight through, not stopping in the small side palaces and it was quite a long walk. It has definitely inspired us to refresh ourselves on Chinese history and custom."
"Crowded as expected. The location is great, close to Tian an men square, bei hai park, etc. and it was an easy ride by subway or bus. Just that some rooms are too dark, can really see much."
"The Forbidden City is seriously ballin'. There's people on top of people on top of people, but it was still totally worth it. They have done plenty of restoration, so it looks pretty good. The place seems to go on forever, with lots of courtyards, rooms, and temples. I definitely recommend checking out this truly historic site, and than after heading over to the park across the street, walking up the hill, and seeing the Forbidden City from above. Totally rad bro!"
"The place is Formidable, the expanse, the size, the awesomeness of it all, everyone has to come here at least once in their lifetime, the obvious luxury that once existed, potentially the greatest civilisation that ever existed head-quartered here. But it was badly let down by the lack of decent information, the audio guide was appalling, humourless, in a sleepy Chinese accent with virtually no information of real interest... the sign-age through the Museum also terrible, for clearly both English and Chinese and the access to real artefacts for viewing very limited... it's more like a walk around a few squares... very sad as I had far higher hopes... But you still have to go."
"Great area to be in. This is a must visit if you are in Beijing ,you can feel how great are the chines culture and the great work that has been done to make it."
"Winter is a good time to visit to avoid the crowds. Not exactly quiet but less bustling makes ideal photo opportunities for pictures without anyone else in the background and less time to queue.
Great showpieces sprawled over a humongous area so be prepared to walk a lot and dress warm. Very historical as it was used by many emperors with the intrigues of palace life. The gadget for audio guide is recommended as there is not much written information on site in any other languages."
"No pictures of descriptions can do justice to the breathtaking size of the Forbidden City: it gives new meaning to the word ""epic"". Its sheer size will confound you, all the more so given that no matter how many visitors come to the site (Beijing numbers being a whole other scale), it never feels packed.

Built to be the self-contained world of emperors, it is, as befits its name, a city within the city, a sprawling network of plazas, buildings, corridors and arcades, and stretching as it does as far as the eye can see, it constitutes a journey back in time. You can lose yourself for hours, with or (in my case, without) the guided tour.

Beijing is fascinating, so it's saying a lot that visiting it for the Forbidden City alone would be more than worth it. One of the wonders of the world.

Note: the exit at the North side is a scam-central, so just smile benevolently at all the ""guides"", ""special taxis"" and ""friendly locals"" and just walk a block or two up before jumping into a car to your next spot.

(visited in September 2014)"
"If you have lots of time, you dont need a tourguide. But we had our private tourguide for our trip in Beijing to take us around as our parents were with us and walking aimlessly is going to tire them. This place is extremely huge and you may get lost but if you just follow the direction of most of the crowd you know where to exit from. It is full of history (stories told by our tourguide) though some areas gets rather repetitive after a while."
"The buildings themselves are beautiful but it is a shame to see so many of them are being restored so quickly. The occasional unrestored you can still see, and are very interesting.
Price is reasonable
I found the tour guide reasonably priced and friendly, and would do again.
There's too much to do, required two trips on two different days (I was culture fatigued by the end).
The clock room and jewel rooms were fascinating."
The emperor's palace that is very very big so called city. But currently there's not much to see if you only have limited time because walking from the entrace to exit itself will takes time.
Visiting the Forbidden City was an incredible experience. the architecture and history are amazing. Well worth a trip.
Recommend talking a guided tour through the city. Lots of history here which makes for an interesting day. Our guide was very knowledgable
"Very organized. There are a lot of shops scattered around selling souvenirs, so you can't miss that chance to buy something, I reckon there are at least 35 souvenir shops in the palace. Highly recommended for history fans, and for them to hire a guide to tell the stories of the palace, otherwise it was also quite an experience to go through the palace architecture and gardens without the narrative. If you go early and your legs haven't given up on you, you can combine the visit with Jingshan Park right at the north exit."
"After visiting this hallowed ground without knowing much about it before, I enjoyed myself. It wasn't until after, delving deep into the history, the struggle, the people; I appreciate it so much more. What a treasure that it is still able to be visited."
This is a place you don't need a tour guide for. Explore at your own pace. Much of the buildings seem to look very similar and you can't go in any of them. A walk through is well worth it though to see the grounds once walked by the Emperor. Recommended 100% also be sure to stop in at jingshan park for an aerial view of forbidden city. its across the street from the exit of the forbidden city.
"Easy to do as independent traveller so no need to book a planned tour or go with a guide... get there early and take your passport or you can't get in! After queuing to get through security it was quick and easy to buy tickets to get in.... we expected to have problems as we heard how busy it can get and we visited on a Chinese New Year holiday which was extra busy. Advise to arrive as close to 8.30am as you can and then you maximise your chances of getting in. Took us about 3 1/2 hours to walk though at a reasonable pace and not looking everywhere by any means so allow plenty of time to explore. Lots of free toilets inside the palace grounds. Expect lots of pushing and shoving, especially when trying to look at the throne .... There is no queuing or manners - a complete free for all. You have two options, either be polite and see nothing or do the same and push your way to the front when you get a chance.... Very different to western culture but all part of the fun of exploring a new country! Be wary of the scam we read about online (including if you use a tour guide) to buy calligraphy from the emperors ""nephew"" - a scam ! An essential when in Beijing!"
It was a crisp -6c but we were rugged up. The moat was frozen and the air clear. The walk through The Square and up to the forbidden city was pleasant. Not too many people and we took a short ride to the South entrance before walking back through the adjoining park. Still worth the visit to this historical site. Watch the persistent tour guides who want to rip you off even when it's closed. Got a lot of steps in on our fitbit. Easy access via the Metro.
"You really do have to see this. It is the centre piece of any trip to Beijing. I have been coming to it for over 35 years at regular intervals with new visitors to the city and it still impresses with the sheer scale of the construction.

I suggest you start in Tiananmen Square and use the underpass to walk to the main entrance. This is easy enough to do as you can get the subway to the square. Then cross the various outer courtyards, join the scrum to get tickets and enter the main part.

The whole thing is huge and you could easily spend a whole day just wandering around. For the ""quick"" trip just stick to the central path and you will get the flavour of the place. I recommend that you also visit the Hall of clocks in the middle of it. This needs a supplementary ticket, but is not expensive and is quite fascinating. Watch the movie there to see how intricate the clocks are and how much fun the makers had.

The rock gardens at the far end are also worth a visit as you leave"
I think Forbidden City is The bigest and longest palace in the world.here is very beautiful and magical with several amazing palaces.I love Forbidden City.
Goes to show you how the Dynasty emperors lived back in the day. The way things were. The symbolic history behind every creature that was at an entrance
"Probably is the season, but the place is just crowded ... I'll recommend to book or buy your tickets in advance and get there really early in the morning"
8000000 tickets sold on the day we visited- hence couldn't get in absolutely rammed with people. we'll go back on a quieter day!
"Walking through the gate into the Forbidden City as you fight with the crowds is one of my most memorable moments from our China trip.
The City opens up to show a collection of huge open squares and ornate buildings.
Exactly what you imagine imperial China to be like. The sense of ancient history is heavy in the air.
Highlight of the trip."
"The forbidden city is obviously on every tourist list when visiting Beijing, so I won't spend much time advertising it. However, I do have some tips for people going there based on my experiences and mistakes: first, plan extra time (and I mean a lot of extra time) to leave the place. While the entrance is right at the subway station, this is an entrance ONLY. Getting into the place is not the problem, it's leaving and making it back to the hotel or wherever else you want to go that is difficult. Many taxis in Beijing are reluctant to take foreigners that don't speak Chinese, and we had around 8 taxis in a row shake their heads as in ""not taking you, try the next one"". It takes around 30 minutes to walk to the nearest metro station, and that is assuming you don't get lost on the way.
Also, the place is a lot more interesting if you have a guide. This will sound uncultured, but to me all the buildings look the same. The audio guides are well worth the 40RMB, and they use a GPS system meaning that the guide automatically starts as you approach a site, which impressed me very much. The explanations given by the audio guide are very interesting, with lots of little stories on what happend in the place."
"The Forbidden City is one most people's list of places to see if they manage to get to China. Covers a vast area which would take all day to get round. Declared a World Heritage site in the 1980's it is now, officially, called ""The Palace Museum""! It was the imperial palace during the Ming and Qing dynasties. The site contains many buildings from temples to living quarters. You cannot enter a lot of the buildings, just look through glazed windows. These windows tended to be quite dirty and the interiors also looked as if they needed a good clean. We expected to be a lot more impressed than we actually were, but still pleased that we visited this historic site."
"The place is just amazing, a pity you only walk, no exhibitions inside. So the place is must go, and really impressive/great. At the same time it is a great pity that there is little there. Have been to many places without a 'real' treasures, but still very informative, educational"
"Don't know how forbidden it is, they let me in there. All jokes aside, it's still an impressive and historical place to walk through. This is one of the places you have to see if you're in Beijing. Plus you knock out Tiananmen square since it's just across the street. So listen to Shia Leboeuf and JUST DO IT!"
An awesome place to visit. Never realized how vast this place was... can fit a million visitors in one area. Yet it felt like wall to wall bodies. Wear your walking shoes cuz the palaces seem to be never ending. You walk from one building to the next and it never seems to end. Beautiful sight thought leaves you in awe at the enormity of this place.
"Its one of the must see items in Beijing. Its remarkable how large the compound is and each section would make an impressive attraction on its own, together its breathtaking. A few days later our group had the opportunity to watch the Last Emperor which made it even more memorable."
"A must see if you are in Beijing. Definately worth it. Has all the old charm of the buildings, and lovely little souvenier shops. Take a good camera with!"
Great place to spend the whole day. Come early and leave on sunset. Great view. Some other pavilions require you to pay additional fees like the room of time. Can't judge if it was worthy but everyone liked.
"My god this place is very huge, you will pass a lot of entrances but this is very nice . our tour guide Jenny is very efficient, even we've learned some of their practices ,after you go from the forbidden city where the emperor buried you need to say a word ""wok wei lai la"" it means come back to the living"
I heard mixed reviews but so glad I went. Important to note: you need your passport to enter. I didn't have mine but luckily they let me in after seeing my partners. There are no market stalls inside so you can walk through in piece without having pens and magnets thrown at you. You can spend as long or as little time as you like. I only spent about 40 minutes but have been told making a day of it is worth it. I recommend visiting the garden across the road first for about $1US The temple gives you the perfect view.
"It's one of the must-see attractions in Beijing for a reason: there's a lot to see, and the entrance fee is very reasonable (40 RMB). I took the audio guide for another 40 RMB that I felt was worth it because your experience becomes a whole lot more complete once you know what the buildings that you're looking at are (my audio guide was in Russian, and the explanations were really good, so I wouldn't be afraid of getting one in your native language - it won't mess up your experience). Alternatively, you may download the information about all the main buildings with their photos in advance, but that felt like too much work for me.
As for the crowdedness, I went on Wednesday, and the palace area was still full of tourists, so I guess it's just inevitable. I would also suggest bringing food with you in advance, since it was rather hard to find a place that sold normal food on the site, and you will definitely get hungry because the palace is enormous: I spent 5 hours inside its walls, and I still didn't have the energy to see everything."
"I visited China in August 2015, I visited many places and the Forbidden City was one of the attractions that I was most looking forward to. I agree with the review below - I would recommend going as it is an integral part of the Chinese culture and history but on the otherhand, I felt that it did get a bit repetitive after a while. It's not an attraction that I would spend all day at but it is definitely worth a visit whilst in Beijing."
Forbidden City was fantastic. They have just changed the rules in 2015 that you need a passport to get in and they only sell so many tickets per day so make sure you are organised for your visit.
"I would definitely recommend going to the Forbidden City. It is such an integral part of Chinese History. We went in the low season and the cost is only 40 RMB/person (roughly $6 US currently). The grounds are immense. It truly is a city. However, after a while it becomes a bit repetitive with another throne for another occasion. Generally there are three bays to look into the buildings (you cannot enter them) and generally only the middle one gives you a unobstructed view of the throne. Give yourself plenty of time and plan on taking a few rests as the City is immense and there will be plenty of walking involved.

After we finished our tour, I thought it might be best to actually walk to the Imperial Gardens and then walk back towards the entrance. This would then put you either at the restaurant for a meal (if so desired) or deposit you back out so you could visit Tiananmen Square or return to the subway.

Don't miss the Imperial Gardens. It is truly the highlight of the City. I only wish that I could have visited in the spring or summer instead of midwinter."
This is huge palace in the area of Kms..this reminds the Chinese culture.. a time travel of 1000 years in a day a must visit place in Beijing..
"The forbidden city was an amazing place to wander through however I believe it would not be half as enjoyable if you did not have a local guide. It was fantastic to see the amazing architecture which is so different from what we were used to. The sheer size of the place takes your breath away. We went in August and it was incredibly hot so whatever you do take a bottle of water with you. It was also incredibly busy and crowded. DO not be surprised if chinese visitors want to take your photo as they are not used to seeing ""westerners"" it is a compliment, initially we found it strange but our guide explained they had not seen westerners in person before."
"Worth a visit just for the history and cultural significance, get the audio guide (40 rmb) otherwise you will have no idea what you're looking at. After a while it all looks the same. First entry costs 40 rmb but separate areas of the palace cost extra. An hour or 2 is all you need."
Be prepared to walk ALOT. The architecture is beautiful. I liked the shopping and photo opportunities especially.
"THE FBC is amazing....though the Bertolucci Film offers a rather ""cleaned-up"" version of The City...visitors will be surprised just by how much of the Palace interiors are in dire need of repair...though the architecture and layout is mesmerizing....and the history is like none other...a must see! Can get crowded...."
All visitors have to visit forbidden city. Tickets are selling only with passport or ID. Morning and afternoon visit is recommended.
"The Forbidden city was for so many years only a place the people knew their Emperor lived but few knew what was behind the walls. A life style so different for the masses yet so forgien to the outside world itself. China as a whole has leaped forward in time for the population yet stepping through the entrance of the city can jump you back in time hundreds, even thousands of years. A place to take your time and try to understand how different life was inside the walls from that outside the walls."
A magical place to visit - you feel as though you are reliving the lives of the emperors and almost walking where you shouldn't! There is a tremendous sense of history woven throughout the complex. Visit the museums and galleries as well. Don't rush this attraction - I spent 7 hours there!
"Only part of the Forbidden is open to the public, but what is available is worth seeing . There some interesting sculptures, dragon heads and roof guardians. Take your camera."
"Certainly an impressive structure that affirms the rich history of the Chinese. Worth a visit when in Beijing. I visited when it was about -13 degrees Celsius - this certainly reduced the crowd I read about and certainly made people a little fast.
Most of the large halls are closed so visitors can only peep - obviously those with long necks will have an advantage.
Better to combine visits to other attractive sites in this area such as the National Museum.

I got a couple of request for a picture from Chinese who obviously had not seen a black guy in person. Black guys beware and know it's a harmless request."
"Just an amazing place. Having visited it once in the summer heat, and now at -15C or colder, it's well worth a visit. There are a total of 1,000 buildings at the Forbidden City, once the residence of emperors. A good thing this place was not destroyed during the turbulent past century. The good thing about visiting it when it's bitterly cold is that the lines of people have been decimated, which made for a nice trip. The highlight for us is the emperors garden by the exit - after the starkness and formality of the main squares, the gardens add a very pleasant human touch to the overall experience. Absolutely a must visit."
"Yowsa. So many people are filing through the Forbidden City. It is definitely a cool experience, but the number of people is overwhelming. Try and go early to avoid some of the crowds."
"I only had 3 days in Beijing and was on a mission to see as much as possible. With the help of China Odyssey Tours and Sophie, my guide, I enjoyed a memorable and excellent trip."
"I highly recommend an audio guide as well as a map to make your visit more worthwhile. Imagine yourself living in the Forbidden City and spend some time imagining the drama and even murders happening all inside this place. One thing lacking was that all the rooms were pretty much empty... I suppose it is too much to ask them to do make replicas to fill up the spaces.. I highly recommend the museum in Taipei, Taiwan where they house all the ""good stuff"" from the Forbidden City."
"this is a must-go place in china. as a chinese, i've been there for so many times, and still i can find something new. it is a place which contains almost 2000 years china history, and really worth to go.
if you dont know mandarin(chinese）, i would recommend you the hire a guide (please find a good one). there's lots of stories you need to know :)) have fun"
"Another big place of tourist spot in Beijing. Similar to the others, it's either history or architecture. If you spend time to find out the history behind, or you just go there to see how the buildings were built in old time.

A lot local guides around and they will offer you their service at their own price. They will tell you without a guide you're just wasting your time there and somehow it's true. The automatic audio tour (electronic guide) is available at around 20CNY (I forgot the price) affordable but the explanation was too brief, some are not working.

It's a crowded place and tourist are everywhere. If you want photoshoot, it might be a little too hard to get a nice place to pose."
"Due to airline issues we had a lay over in Beijing (13 hours). Enough time for visiting the Forbidden City. To get a visa is not a problem (I only collected experience with a German passport, don't know how it works with other nationalities). The public transport works fine and efficient, maybe you will have some problems with getting money from the ATM (we only found Chinese ""speaking"" ones)...
Be sure to have enough time for the Forbidden City otherwise you will get in trouble by losing time for example while trying to find an exit. We tried and failed several times but we had fun and we won't miss this stopp over with the flying Beijing visit :-)"
"I've been to the Forbidden City at least 3 times. The buildings are AMAZING and there's a lot of history to learn about and see. I took an English speaking guided tour once, and used the headphones another time. Really, there is just so much history and culture here you can't believe it."
"the forbidden city is a surprising place; already coming in through the main gate it's an experience of the sorts with hundred of visitors squeezing to access the premises; however when inside, all these people seem little and small compared to the grandiosity, elegance, harmony of one magnificent square after the other, one palace bigger than the other."
"Great place to see, amazing historical place, affordable entry fee, shops, cafe inside
We were unlucky with the weather it was -17c, and it's outdoor- enjoy this during the summer"
Absolutely amazing. A travel in Chinese history and culture. I recommend a guide who can tell you about everything.
"A vast sweep of imperial history across almost 600 years; a deeply fascinating and humbling experience. Will most certainly be a highlight of your time in Beijing. DO NOT MISS THIS, especially if you are interested in China and its bewildering past. Do bring your passport along. Security is extremely tight and all forms of identification will serve you well....."
"When buying your entrance ticket ID is required . Once you are through security you are able to explore this HUGE complex . You can either hire a audio guide , hire a local guide or wander around on your own . If you want to appreciate the scale of the Chinese culture then this is the place to visit . Interesting architecture and the garden area is also beautiful . Traffic through the forbidden city is one way and on exiting walk across the road and visit the park for elevated views of the Forbidden City . Another hint is turn left or right on exit and take some pictures of the towers at the end of the walls . If you don't like walking and crowds you should rather skip this and if you don't like crowds rather skip China . Closed on Mondays ."
"This is well worth a visit. We got the earphones to give us some history which was useful although a bit too detailed.
It is amazing to see such Chinese history and the city is vast!"
"The sheer size of the Forbidden City is impressive. Nonetheless in my opinion it is enough to just visit the first inner couryard as it keeps repeating itself.
Also they charge more cover fees for every additional part of the city you wanna visit."
"It is Located in the center of the City, you can take Line 1 Subway Metro station and get down in Tian'anmen East or west station, the entrance fee Cost around 40 Yuan, For Tourist Please carry your passport, the ticket will issued on your name.
Do not hire any of the ""tour guides"" that will offer their services outside of the palace.
The audio tour provided by the The Palace Museum provided enough."
"The visit of forbibben city is a time travel, you fell like in king~s time, full of simbology. Worth while. Does not need a guide."
"We spent a few hours here together with a private guide, he wanted to be called Thomas but he had of course a Chineese name. It was a good choice to get a provat guide. But it will cost you around 300. But it was worth it, I would not be able to understand and really feel how it once has been inside the forbidden city without a guide. This was a really wonderful visit and I learned a lot! Impressing is a word not big enough to describe it!"
"There a great number of individual facets to the Forbidden City. The whole complex is huge. Don't expect to be overawed by the opulence. The significance of its existence, is trying to grasp the history of Chinese dynasties."
It was incredible to learn the history of this vast beautiful city. From the architecture to the stones you walk on. Just breathtaking!
"If you've ever been to Beijing, this is a must see location. Huge place, take you the whole day to visit and if you want to spend time to carefully observe everything you need to come back again for sure. Highlight: the best souvenir gift shops in town!! If you plan to buy gifts or souvenir for friends, don't hesitate. You won't find the same stuffs or such as good quality commodities in other places around Beijing."
"Such interesting history and increased our understanding and appreciation for Chinese culture. The audio tour provided by the The Palace Museum provided enough info to fulfill our curiosity.
We were advised to NOT hire any of the many ""tour guides"" that will offer their services outside of the palace.
It was crowded, but everything in Beijing is. It's such a huge place, we didn't wait very long to buy tickets despite the crowds."
The forbidden city looks exactly like the movies. However it did feel like you were repeating yourself as we went from the south tower to the north tower.
"Beijing is an amazing city-and Tiananmen Square/Forbidden City is spectacular. So much modern and ancient history, it's worth it to hire a guide to lead you around, particularly the Forbidden City- it is immense and it's easy to sort of lose your way. I was there on an extremely cold day recently so there were very few visitors- it's was great exploring little passages and feeling like you were alone there."
This is an downside and very crowded excursion but well worth the visit. I highly recommend seeing the palace.
"Even though we visited in January, I felt the palace was still very busy and can't imagine what it must be like in summer. Nonetheless it is an essential spot to visit in Beijing. A vast network of some of the most stunning ancient architectural buildings. Would recommend the audio guide for extra anecdotes about each area and its map which tracks your location like a GPS, even recommending routes based on the time you have and ""ticking off"" each part you visit."
"This place is not big, it is huge. You could spend 2 days here to discover this amazing architecture, China has long history and a lot of secrets were happened here. You should visit Forbidden City at least one time in your life."
"Important notice: Don't forget to bring your ID ( for Chinese ) Paspor for foreigners. Ticketing officers do not sell tickets without ID or paspor.

We take MRT line 5 and stop at Qianmen, walked about 15 minutes to main gate for buy tickets. A long line of people's in about 10 ticketing booths. After get the tickets go to left which can find the Meridian Gate front entrance to the Forbidden City with 2 protruding wings. The tickets officers will check our tickets one by one. And large bags will be check with high security. Is better to bring small hand bag .

Forbidden City are known well by local peoples or taxi driver by ""GUGONG"" means former palace. I bring my mother, sisters and niece, mom is 83 year old, consider the palace is extremely huge, we bring wheels chair for her, there are special path for wheels chair.

After main gate we found the tourist information and rent the audio consider I can't understand mandarin well, so I decided to rent one with English language. Paid 40 Yuan. The thing is the officer instruction not to touch other botton except the volume. The audio was off almost all the time. So we don't really get the information each time we step on the palace.

Total of time to finish all the palace will take about 6-8 hours. If only visit to the Gate of Supreme Harmony, Hall of Supreme Harmony, Palace of Heavenly Purity , Hall of Mental Cultivation, take photos of The throne in Hall of Preserving Harmony, The Throne in the palace of Heavenly Purity and A Gilded Lion in front of the palace of Tranquil Longevity, took about 2 hours time.

We try to go further, but it is too huge place to explore, maybe next time if I travel alone.

Overall Forbidden City is a Must see, for once in a live time. Strongly recommend."
"the place is big and i dont think its not that beautiful. but itsokay if you visit here, remembering this place is very famous"
"My husband and I visited the Forbidden City in November 2015 while on holiday. We were completely taken back by the details of each building, the massive size of the city, and captivated by the history. We participated in a tour which we would highly recommend. We learned so much from our tour guide who really brought the history of the city to life. This is a must do while visiting Beijing. You will not be disappointed."
"We have visited this place before and dreamt of going back with a guide. Perhaps we were late, there were a few guides available in Chinese but none in English. The next time I will arrange the tour guide beforehand. At the entrance we went in, there was a place where you can dress up, sit on the throne and have your photo taken. I am not sure if it is off peak time but it costs only CNY10. The photos we saw were very nice but as we were already later than we wanted, we did not do that. It costs much more in all the other places we came across so if you are interested, do it here.
I saw part of a documentary on the Forbidden City and it really added to the excitement of the place. The slab of rock with the dragons inscribed was so heavy that it took hundreds of men and horses to pull it. It also had to be transported in winter when the ground froze, otherwise it was so heavy that it sank into the earth.
All in all very impressive, just so sad that one cannot go inside the rooms.
The gardens were beautiful. Must take a stroll.
Near subway.
Highly recommended."
i ll make it short and give you some good tips ..... go after lunch time and if possible on a rainny day !!! the foggy armosphere is amazing aaaaaand there are no crowds at all !!! you will love it !! also fo not forget to visit the jewellery exhibition winderful
"It was pretty cool to tour Forbidden City, lots of history and was glad I checked out this key landmark."
hotel was situated just around the corner from the square so we visited it a few time. Vast and hard to believe awful things happened there in 1988. The forbidden city itself is incredible and can take a whole day to see.
"It was home to 24 emperors from three dynasties.The Forbidden City is the largest palace on planet Earth. It was built for the 'celestial son of heaven' for his divine rule , mandated from above. Surrounded by high walls and moats, common folks were forbidded in this sacred ground.

At the Meridian Gate , we entered the Outer Court of the Forbidden City .There was a huge square with five dragon bridges to another gateway. Walking further ,we reached the majestic Hall of Supreme Harmony.In here , the emperor displayed his power to a kneeling audience in fear. He is head of state ,military commander , treasurer, foreign minister, judge and executioner. At the Inner Court is his earthly residence.There are palaces , halls , temples , pavilions and several imperial gardens.He lives with his empress, concubines, royal consorts and an army of eunuchs.

We left the Forbidden City in awe.It was a huge and mystic palace for an ancient emperor god on planet Earth.

 "
One of the most enchanting places I have ever been to in my life. You must be there to understand just how big this place is. A once in a lifetime experience. Mesmerizing. Not to be missed when in Beijing.
Really busy but a fantastic place to visit with lots to see. Went during national holiday...bad idea :P
"The contents of the Forbidden city were shipped to Taiwan during the civil war, that's why the Forbidden city is empty. The forbidden city has some nice architecture but there's nothing there really. You're better off visiting Taiwan's national museum in Taipei to see what used to be here."
"Definitely a must see in Beijing! You will be amazed by the sheer size of this city as you are immersed in the history of China while exploring halls and pavillions, imperial treasures and gardens!
We went with a guide who explained the history and significance to us which was very helpful. Very busy at the front entrance. We had purchased our tickets in advance through our tour company."
I am sure the most amazing place to visit if it was not shoulder to shoulder tourists.. Unable to hear our guide speaking.. Gave p and got taxi back to hotel
"Its certainly worth visitig. Very impressive, not only in size but also all the diverse buildings, and halls, and corridors and artefacts. If you have time its also worth wandering off east and west, where there are less people, but still very intersting."
"Very impressive; the vastness is mindboggling and it's hard to imagine how
such a structure could have been built so many years ago!!"
"No doubt it is a must see place in Beijing but please don't have a high expectation, you are going to be very disappointed, like me. Too many tourists and almost all of the halls were closed. You can only view from outside with many people's head as the foreground.

The outlook of it still represents the pinnacle of China's architecture but the atmosphere simply ruined by the body who is running it. Without proper control of crowd, this place is not worth to spend your days in China.

However, if you are historical lover, there are things for your to explore. You can spend a day or two here to slowly unveil the mystery of ancient China. If you have limited time, go to other place like Temple of Heaven and such. If you just want to tick off the list, by all means.

Btw, do I mention that this place is totally not friendly towards young kids/toddlers? Nobody will give a damn with the baby in your hands."
"The walk through time was indeed a memorable experience. It's rich in history and they still maintain the original structure and furniture, It's amazingly to actually be there.Take a lot of pictures for its not often that we can visit such places."
"My friends and I were there last summer, the best place was the Imperial Gardens. I think that made the entire trip worth it. It's okay to see the open courtyards, the palaces, etc, but the gardens were by far the best."
"Worth visiting, it is very cheap to get in and takes a few hours to look around!

The buildings exterior is interesting and there is plaques available to read about the history"
"We have read quite few guides before coming to Beijin but not even one was mentioning that the Forbidden city is closed on mondays!! So imagine an enormous deception when the second most important site that we wanted to see in 2,5 day in Beijing was forbidden for us!"
"Amazing Archititure. However Slightly disappointed that may of the temples were shut.

You were able to see into a few temples which were impressive. Large site which I recommend half a day for."
Forbidden city is a must when you go to Beijing. You can go shopping afterwards in wangfujing street. Wander about between the walls and think off all the history
"Somewhat overrated. Am I allowed to say that? Obviously, it's amazing to be able to walk through the same gates that 400 years of emperors and dynasties walked through.

However, me and my party of 5 all felt like it lacked something. It lacked soul, almost? Or activities? It's 2km of vast open squares, beautiful palaces (which you can't enter) and gates. Once you've walked through the first gate, it feels like the second gate, which feels like the third gate...

Don't get me wrong, you have to do it if you're in Beijing. And it is filled with history.

But it lacks More. Wear comfortable walking shoes, too!"
Great place to visit. The crowds were not so bad now that they implemented access control. We hired a guide which was very helpful. Walking up the hill at the North gate is a great way to see the big picture.
"It's just amazing to think about how you're at a place that you would be killed to be at for the past couple centuries. For me it's just really amazing to think about how the most powerful person and hundreds of his pretty concubines and servers used to live and die in here.
TIP:
1. Avoid summer and national day if you can, because you wanna go for an amazing experience, not to see more people.
2. If you're a student, show them your student card and be nice to the ticket person. I showed my UofT student card and i got the ticket for 20yuan, made me really happy!"
"A complex made of several palaces, beautiful yards and gardens. You can't enter the palaces and inside them is quite dark and there's way too many people in front of the door, so you don't get much of an inside view of the palaces. Get an electronic guide as it tells you the history of each place you visit. Make sure you see the Tiananmen Square as it is nearby.
After your visit is done, go to the park/temple opposite the forbidden city. Go up to the temple where you get a view of the whole forbidden city.
Have fun!"
Definitely a must see. Outstanding preservation of centuries of history. Breath taking at a minimum.
"The Forbidden City is the royal city of the past Chinese dynasties. It was abandoned on 1912 at the end of the last emperor's reign and was closed until 1949. There are two ticket prices to pay: entrance into the grounds that together equate to about 7.30. The palaces are huge imposing buildings from the exterior with beautiful colors and designs. The interiors are not accessible for the most part and are mostly bare except for throne-type dais.

Of course, multiple opportunities to shop exist through the the grounds."
"A great place to explore the history of Beijing. Give yourself lots of time to explore as the forbidden city is very big! Also, if the weather is hot there aren't many places to get shelter. Make sure you take your passport if you are a foreign visitor otherwise they will not allow you entry."
"Expect to spend at least several hours in there... Also, go through the stuff on the sides as the structures in the middle are just thrones.

**Bring passport** needed to buy tickets!"
"The shear mass and volume of buildings is overwhelming. What makes it all more impressive is that all of it was built without modern machinery. It offers many things to see and if you have a good, many things to learn. Note; If you visit in January be prepared for bone chilling cold with few even minimally warm areas. The coffee shop does have hot coffee, tea and food and is warmed."
Take a half day to see this. Check out the days its closed because they tend to surprise you with that. Gardens and museum are wonderful. Chinese history at it's best.
"We went in winter and luckily the place was not as crowded as the other reviewers mentioned.

The place is huge and therefore require a lot of walking so be prepared, have appropriate footwear, plenty of food and drink and lots of power for your cameras.

It will be difficult to get pictures when there is no other people in the photo.

Once you are out on the other side, it will be a long way from where you started."
The Forbidden City and the Palace Museum is a great walk. It is always crowded and a guide might help you with all the little things.
"It's a huge museum complex, don't miss this tourist treasure, China is a great culture and the Forbidden City is a confirmation of ancient history with autentic traditions."
"I did not have the faintest idea what to expect when we went to visit this extraordinary site. So much so, in fact, that I did not know if the ""Palace Museum"" was an ""inside"" or ""outside"" experience. And of course (and be forewarned), it is very much an outside experience. I think we had been on the site for about 90 minutes when we reached an information desk with a visibly Caucasian male behind the counter. Having enjoyed the experience to date (the Cermaics exhibition, off to one side, is a must and accounted for much of our 90 minutes to that time), we thought we would inquire from someone who so obviously spoke English (and was in fact from Britain) as to what should be seen before leaving. He soon apprised of us of the startling fact that we had hardly begun the visit, and that there was a great deal more left to discover. I can only advise those who think of spending perhaps 2 hours in the Forbidden City that it is a big mistake. You really do need a half-day at the minimum. It is a simply overwhelming experience and says a great deal about China in general, even though it is not itself a particularly ancient place. It is just wondrous..."
"We have only seen the Forbidden City in photos and movies and it felt surreal to actually be standing there in person! Amazing architecture, details and history. We spent about 3 hours walking through. One of my favourite spot was the royal garden with some rare plants and trees that we have not seen before. You cannot help but imagine the life of royalty as you wander through the grand halls and courtyards. At the end of our tour, we crossed the street to Jingshan Park and climbed up the hill where you can get a full view of the city and the Forbidden City."
"The Palace Museum in the Forbidden City is very amazing and fantastic,which is a better place to know chinese history and culture!We were deeply shocked when we looked form outside!"
"Snow brings out the beauty of the Forbidden City and I sure attest to that. It will be freezing cold and you won't find heaters to warm your numbing toes and fingers.. But it will be worth every penny. Get there as early as possible (it opens at 8.30am) as there was a queue when I went around noon. Be prepared to spend at least a day as the place is huge and has many areas to explore slowly with attention. On your way out, stop by the pastry shop next to the souvenir shop and check-out the pastries."
"This is a must visit in Beijing. So much history and beauty and the vast size of the Forbidden City is impressive. There is a lot of walking and it's hard to get her or leave by a close taxi, so have good walking shoes!"
we made a short path trough and were impressed of all this monumental places and buildings. You could even feel the history.
"The site is well organized and beautiful. You feel that you enter another world. A ""must"" visit if you are at Beijing."
"Very interesting place, a glimpse into the history, must visit. All that said, it's not to well organized, no lines, poor descriptions or guides, only 2 buildings were open and huge crowds trying to get in, roaming around... Probably the same understaffing and overworking the employees that you encounter in many places in China..."
The palace and halls at the Forbidden City are a beautiful and fascinating look at historical Chinese royalty. Each succeeding building seems more interesting than the last. Simply amazing!
The grounds are beautiful and the buildings are magnificent. It is a very large palace. I was disappointed that they did not allow visitors inside the buildings. There were only 2 buildings open where you could peer from the outside and look in without having to look through dirty glass. The emperor's quarter you could look through dirty glass and see some of the special treasures. I think it would be more enjoyable if tourists could go inside.
"Half of the place is locked away from the tourists, but the design is intricate and history great to follow! 40 Yuan is the entry fee. Do buy water and snacks before you hit the touristy spots to save some."
"This was my favorite place to visit in China. It is way to hard to explain my visit there. I fell in love with the place. I could only imagine living there. Words cannot explain the beauty of this place. I would love to visit when it isn't snowing, rainy and cold. This is for sure a future visit for me and family."
"A very beautifull place to visit!! You should go in the morning when it opens to avoid all the people. This is the only problem, you cannot enjoy the view because off the many visitors!"
Visited this place for a quick trip. Was good not disappointed at all. They could use a proper line system for visiting. There was none. It was very chaotic.
I visited the Forbidden City and obviously enjoyed it very much. However it really lacks variety as the pavilions / palaces are very similar to each other
"go early, beat the crowds, dicker when they offer souvenirs, take plenty of pictures --- read about the dynasties before you go"
"The area is very huge but they looks similar to one another.And some parts were closed during the visit.
The outside is more beautiful,especially with the ice on the water ,together with the buildings.

It is special but feel a bit disappointed compared to my expectations.

Tips:Go to the Jingshan Park on the opposite road after exit from Forbidden city.Just pay CNY$2 to go to the top and see the total lookout of forbidden city.Although the day of my visit didn't have a clear blue sky,still can see a bit with frog.I believe it will be much more pretty if under a clear blue sky."
Landmark in Beijing. Biggest palace in the world. Bring a mask when you walk outside. Beijing is so polluted.
"This place is pretty huge and takes half a day at least if you are thoroughly seeing everything. We went with a private guide where she explained all the history behind the place. You get to see many buildings which are sections of the palace, gardens, structures and many open places..And was pretty crowded as well."
You have to pay to get in and then to see the things inside like he museum. The forbidden city was a good sight but I wasnt that amazed its so busy you cant really take it in.
"Our family visited the Forbidden City just after Christmas (on 29th of Dec), and that was great day to visit! Not too many tourists and good weather! We had our personal guide Jessie with us, which gave much more thann without guide!"
"We loved our walk here and enjoyed the sunny autumn weather. The place i huge though so take your time. We didn't make it to all the corners of this place, bur whatever part your choosing to discover, it's beautiful."
We visited the forbidden city for a couple of hours. Definitely this is an impressive piece of architecture. Both through its size and its style. Never the less its a different kind of impression than a castle in Europe as most of the building are one floor only and completely wooden and most look quite the same for an unschooled eye. Still definitely worth a visit!
"Truly lots of visitors at the ticket place, at the entrance gate, in the compounds after compounds in the Forbidden City except inside the palaces. The whole area which was once a family’s living quarter and a place for the emperor’s administration was full of people on the day I was there.

In spite of all this, I could penetrate what I saw to know its past to understand its present existence better. I also tried to locate my angle that’s different from all others to find its meaning to me, to the world, and to the future.

I hope it’s more effectively managed, setting bilingual signage to divert visitors to other less patronized, smaller compounds with palaces previously closed and having a daily control of influx of visitors."
"Visited with a private tour guide. A huge place, I guess, that is why it is called a city. The visit gives you a perspective how the chineses dynasties lived and functioned."
"No visit to China is complete without visiting this place. The buildings are awesome and fortunately for us, it had rained the day before so the skies were bright blue and clear - no pollution whatsoever! Our guide led us to the less crowded areas but I feel as if another visit is warranted because I don't feel like we saw enough of the place. A full day wouldn't be sufficient to walk around the massive grounds..."
"It's inside the famous forbidden city and there's lot of museums within the vicinity.
I recommend to visit tbe kings treasures and watches collection museum, we need to take separate tickets at the entrance."
"Spend at least a day at the forbidden city. U need all the time. The number of palaces alone is enough to awe u!!

And not just the architecture but also the layout, the way the structures are built to Ensure coolness in summer and warmth in winter and the amazing way of using stoned structures with water to keep the temperature of the city.

Get a travel guide to bring u around and share the history of the place with u. It's worth it and also to take tea up the hill behind the forbidden city to get a good bird eye view of the entire city!!

Enjoy!! And don't miss the Great Wall of china too!!"
"Spend the money on a private guide. Our guide avoided the crowds (not too many in winter), knew many interesting facts and made the whole experience easy."
"Overall surprised at how shoddy this attraction was. Given its significance I would have thought the government would have put more effort into its presentation & restoration. Beware it is a significant attraction for the locals, you may find yourself jostled and pushed out of the way!"
Well this is an exciting experience especially if you do your homework and have a good language speaking guide. I cannot tell you how gratifying this experience is as you will just have to see for yourself
Just in awe to finally see this place. I thought of Mulan when walking through. The huge red doors are grand and as soon as you walk through you feel transported through time. Come early morning when crowds aren't too much. Expect to stay a couple of hours to visit the different buildings and garden. You will want to take lots of pictures.
"As with almost everything in China, this was was a mess and a huge disappointment. It was snowing and foggy and the snow made it a nightmare to walk around, plus the fact that the whole place was packed to the brim with Chinese tourists-it was really unpleasant to walk around. The entire complex is just room after room of Chinese courtyards and gateways. Nothing really to look at. Except your feet as you will get trampled on as you walk through with all the Chinese gazing up at their sky loft selfie sticks and not looking where they are walking. We could have made it through much quicker if we were not shooed out of the way of countless selfie photos and ""peace sign"" pictures. Get a grip. Plus it is wildly expensive for what it is. DO NOT BOTHER."
My favorite place to go for a walk mid afternoon. The museum close at 4:30pm. Stops selling tickets at 3:30pm. During this hour the museum is nearly empty. This is the best hour to be here to feel the tranquility. The crowd makes it impossible to enjoy this place.
"The Forbidden City went on and on and on. You would need more than a day to see it all. I was so amazed at how the area before the actual entrance could hold 1 million people with ease. Once inside, the outer courtyard, surrounded by hundreds of rooms, leads to another courtyard and then to another and so on. It's hard to get your head around the manpower required to complete such an enormous structure. A definate must see when in Beijing."
"Spectacular place, especially if you have watched The Last Emperor film. Lots of walking involved to get the full benefit. Gives you an idea of how impressive Imperial China must have been all those centuries ago. They are rapidly making up for lost time...."
"It,s huge place including so many section(each section contain so many room and things to see and explore).
If you want to visit there go early (in most day long queue)because you mist some place due to lack of time.
It,s highly recommended to hire tour guide to explain story about each place to save time."
"The Palace is one of the World Heritage site, this place indeed has earned that destination, beautiful architecture with awesome Landscape. Anyone who visits Beijing must travel around the palace, should not miss. It is just simply gorgeous and amazing. Lines are long and lots of people around. I think, all the attractions in China are enormous and this is no exception. We spent two to three hours here and there is so much to see you could easily fill the day. Our tour concentrated on the main sites as you follow the route from south to north. There was more to see than we had time for and yes it was crowded in places but not too bad for a morning visit."
The area is huge and the palace itself is truly magnificent. A must-see object if you are thinking of traveling to Beijing.
"While people are talking about doing half day tour for the Palace Museum, i guess you cant finish it in a day. This palace is huge and there are so many sections. Winter tickets is 40rmb. From the emperor meeting room to the empress rest room... it's so unique. Just look at the roof of each building , its deco is so beautiful. A place not to be miss when you are in Beijing."
The description of 4 hours required is not an exaggeration. This city unfolds before you and becomes a maze of places to discover. Do not miss the Imperial Garden - beautiful even in the winter. Dress warmly if it is cold as very few rooms are enterable or heated warmly. We did eat in the Palace coffee shop because we were cold and hungry. Fried dumplings were good and hot drinks saved the day!
"It's a masterpiece for those in love with history and architecture. The magnitude is awe inspiring. Each corridors , each vase and each building has a story attached to it which is worth exploring."
"It's just a brilliant place to visit in Beijing, indeed it is a must visit. Every door and wall was beautifully constructed. It was massive and covered in a vast area, you required to walk a lot inside the palace. Carry passports for the tickets. As our guide gave an insight view of the palace, so please hire a guide to know the history of one of the finest rulers of China. we are unable to cover the whole area because of our tight schedule. If you go early you can watch the whole palace but it'll be very tiresome, so better to visit in the noon session after the Tiananmen square view. Have fun!"
Forbidden city is attached to Chinese history. It is an architectural feast for the visitors. The visitors will be surprised one of after other. the tour will take half day
"Very well maintained ...
Engage a freelance local tour guide to fully appreciate its significance - just make sure that you have agreed on the fees first. All major languages catered for. Alternatively, rent a WiFi headphone for site-specific explanation."
"It's worth going to see the private sanctum of the once elite and ruling class. Very big, and some exhibits are at additional cost. Very impressive but if you aren't in great health or can walk miles don't go"
"This is a massive complex. Go early, we were told it does sell out and you will not be able to enter if they are at capacity. There are so many visitors, it will astound you. We did get the audio guides, but neither of ours worked and we didn't see a point to try to get it fixed. you will find that most people do not speak english, so dealing with issues are not straight forward, but so what! We just enjoyed the sights and read a little from our guide book instead. I am disabled so seeing all parts was impossible, but I did get to see a lot and it was worthwhile regardless. When you get to the points of interest that show the interior of a building, but don't let you enter...be prepared to push through the crowds, or be tall. It is a must if you are visiting for tourism. Loved the cinnabar colored walls and gardens at the end of the tour the best. It is a remarkable complex."
"The Forbidden City gathers lots of pavilions and gardens to visit in slow pace. Take your time to observe lots of details of doors, walls, paintings, dragons, sculptures of different animals..."
"Plan to leave plenty of time. Most of a day (we didn't leave enough time).

It's a beautiful place to visit, very big (about 800 buildings, though only some you can access). Most of the buildings you can access have been set up as museums.

It's great to observe both the outdoor and indoor areas.

Lot's of interesting history as well."
"This place is huge and needs lots of walking. It is especially slippery during winter snow in late Nov 2015. Other than taking pictures, you might need a guide to explain to you the various parts of the palace. Very crowded."
"Yes it's big, yes it has lots of history, but it's poorly maintained and very tacky in places with video inserts. Most of the buildings cannot be seen well, and they don't appear to have much to show, other than the CROWN ROOM. No help in foreign languages and many routes lead to dead ends and you just have to turn around. A picturesque moat surrounds it. Overall, very disappointing."
The size and scale of the Forbidden City are huge! The 24-palace complex in the heart of Beijing can easily take you the whole day to explore if you like to go into detail. Do not miss the Clock Exhibition Hall (additional 10 RMB entrance fee). I did expect more from the exhibitions inside the palaces tough. The audio guide (40 RMB) is supposed to track where you are using GPS but ours was not reliable at all.
"The place is quite well maintained. Lot to walk inside and see , the brilliance of our forefathers. Minimum will take a couple of hours to cover the destination"
A good overview of the history of the forbidden city and worth taking time over. I stress that a half to full day is needed in the entire complex to fully appreciate it.
The Forbidden City is like no other place on earth. Watch the netflix video on the place. The entirety cannot be explored in a few hours - i wish we had more time. The garden was a surprise - I hadn't read of that - and its beautiful. Winter is best time to go - not much in the way of crowds (comparatively speaking).
"This is an incredibly interesting, historical former royal Palace in Beijing not to be missed.
We finally got to see where our favourite movie ""The Last Emperor"" was filmed. We visited here as part of a 2 day private tour with Jack's Tours and spent 3 hours, which was adequate, but really a lot more time could be spent soaking up the incredible history!
Make sure you allow enough time to view the amazing grounds and temples. If you are in Beijing you MUST visit the Forbidden City."
"I visited on a horribly wet day, and would recommend avoiding this if you have time to wait for dry weather. However even in pouring rain it was fascinating. I am not usually a fan of guided tours, but due to language issues I decided to take a gamble and pay for a one to one English speaking guide from a regulated tourist service who operate outside the gates, She was fluent in English and extremely knowledgable about the history of the place and her service was well worth the cost. We could go at whatever pace I wanted and she was able to answer any questions and also gave advice about other places to visit in my short visit. If you did not have a guide of any kind you would miss a lot as here is very little signage. Even on a wet day in May it was extremely crowded and pick pocketing is a risk you need to be aware of. If you have only a day to spend in Beijing, I would recommend making this place your top priority."
"Very interesting palace (Forbidden city) , lots of Iconic sights.
Was good to visit in winter as not too busy.
I would strongly advise on getting the audio tour kit as its not expensive and talks you through your visit automatically as you walk and makes it much more interesting."
I went in 2005 and also again in 2015. There are a lot of buildings to see and the crowds can become unbearable during the peak seasons.
"We visited the Forbidden City. It is quite impressive, but after a little while, all the buildings looks the same and I got bored. I think that unless you are a big fan of Chinese history, 30 minutes in the Forbidden City is enough time."
"A World Heritage. Formerly called Forbidden City because commoners are not allowed to come here until they open it to the public. Only the Emperor can walk thru the centre isle of the front gate of the palace. Very nice architecture, full of history. This is next to Mao Tse Tung's resting place. A must see in Beijing, don't miss it."
"Coming here can learn alot of different story about how all the emperors works, live & punish the so called prisoners. I have learnt alot from there. And I'm a olden China history lover especially towards Qing dynasty history. 👍 I even bought a great book there. Its just RMB 25. Cheap."
"This area of the Forbidden City is large with a a seemingly endless number of buildings. Some buildings are reconstructed. Some you can go in, others at best you see from the outside. Get a guide or guidebook to understand what you are seeing and the significance of this historic place. There is security. Signage is nil."
"A must see on your trip in Beijing! Be prepared to do a LOT of walking, allow time for breaks, and to deal with crowds."
"Visited this place two times now and it takes my breath away... EVERY SINGLE TIME! It is huge inside so reserve at least 3 hours. Wasn't able to go through everything both times, unfortunately."
"Place museum is also called Imperial Palace or Forbidden City, it was a royal palace for both Ming and Qing Dynasty. It's a must tour place in Beijing. It's huge inside, probably need 3-4 hours walk. By metro is very convenient, Metro Line1, get off at Tian'anmen Dong Station, north west exit."
Get a tour guide a must if you want to truly understand this unique culture and history of this dynasty. One wonders the power of a single man who ruled an entire country as large as this. Could do with some one like this in my company... Lol. But jokes apart a must visit. Check the fog levels before you go as there is a lot of walking. Do go for the tea ceremony there but don't buy any thing from there highly over priced. There game is ooh pay 50 and then buy something from us and you will get your 50 back it's a con. If you like anything from there shop take pictures of it and go find it some where else. I hope this helps you out.
"Beautiful architecture. Landscape is awesome.

A must visit at least once. Must not miss.

Take at least half a day here. Wear a pair of good walking shoes and make sure your camera don't run out of battery.

A must visit !"
Nice Place to visit...........Dont forget if go to market or any traditional store bargain 20% from first offer price........
"especially if one has watched chinese historical dramas all their lives and know well the stories of imperial intrigue, sabotage, scheming concubines, assasination plots and coups, going to the Palace really brings all these imagery to life. the grounds are extensive, the palace is beautiful, right down from tiananmen so an easy days' visit. Security is tight, and foreigners should bring their passports in order to buy an entrance ticket. One watch out is the amount of crowds, be prepared to push and shove especially at the hall where the emperor's throne room is - the locals have no qualms on pushing and tearing at the other visitors to get a glimpse of the throne. You have to be prepared to use your elbows to defend yourself and don't hesitate to be less than polite."
Beautiful ancient architecture and furniture/pieces that should not be missed. There is a lot of walking to do in the forbidden city so wear good and comfortable shoes!
"Our tour was a little rushed and hence we didn't have the opportunity to actually go inside any of the buildings, but the scale from the outside is really quite amazing."
A very good historical site. Takes you back in centuries to the 15th century. This is a very well preserved heritage site. You need to touch the place to complete your visit to BJ
"I guess taking the subway is convenient. That you will get near to the entrance of the museum. There were many people on a Saturday, very long queues at the ticket counters and they checked EACH passport. Try to go on a weekday, if you wanna beat the crowd. And they really scan your bags (they do that in many other places too) for security reasons. It's a huge place. Knowing its history helps us to admire the place better. What we usually read in prints or watch in movies was now right in front of our eyes, that is awesome. We paid RMB20 for the automatic tour information device (only tells you basic information), and we got a free pamphlet after we entered the museum. Do not buy it outside the entrance. Also, a personal tour guide costs at least RMB260 and you have to pay surcharge for each additional member in your group. It's a huge area, be ready with lots of walking. Basically Beijing is big, everywhere involves lots of walking."
"This was really worth visiting! A student ticket costs no more than 20 RMB. Please note that you have to bring your passport to purchase a ticket to the Palace Museum. The place itself is amazing. It is, of course, very touristy, but you will have that feeling of history and tradition nevertheless."
So much to see and do. It is once place not to be missed. Huge crowds. Go with the flow. Many signs in English. Buildings are fascinating. It is a vast area so leave plenty of time. Go on a good weather day = we went on a snowy day and there were still huge crowds.
"Wowee, I have always been fascinated by the Forbidden City. From the layout to the architecture, and the size of it! Be prepared for the huge crowd that you will definitely experience while visiting. That being said, it does not take long to purchase the entrance tickets as well as get in as they are pretty quick in handling the crowd. If you have a student ID or over 60 you get a 50% discount on the ticket price. Also aside from the entrance fee, you have to pay separately for the different museums inside the Forbidden City if you want to visit them. Compared to many years before, you are not allowed to enter many of the palaces/halls anymore, especially the main halls where the emperor’s throne is. You can only take a peek from outside, so be prepared to push and squeeze your way through the crowd who also want to take a look through the doors. Definitely a must see when in Beijing."
"Strongly recommended.
Some areas are still preserved if you want to see what it initially looked like, but all the paint work, while new, is a copy of what was originally there.
While going in the winter months may sound like a deterrent, don't let it put you off. Yes it was cold, but there was no where near the crowds as summer months, and we barely had to wait to get in and when inside we were not being pushed around, we just wondered around admiring the buildings.
When I went it was snowing, which in my opinion made it even better. Especially when you reach the garden in the center, it was beautiful."
"The whole forbidden city is awesome but the museum is a must do. We spend too much on jade, jade, and more jade!"
"We were not prepared for the vastness of the Forbidden City. The architecture was wonderful.
To see inside the buildings was difficult because of the dim interior and trying to see past everyone else craning for a look.
Enjoy the grounds and soak up the history.
November was cold but the tourist season is almost at a close so less people."
"We only had two hours here but there is sooo soo much to see that you could literally spend and entire day. I would suggest at least the audio tour , but if not, be sure to read all of the plaques. Once you are in, you must walk all the way through to get out. Also, be certain to have identification with you. You must present identification to obtain your ticket."
"Our tour was a little rushed and hence we didn't have the opportunity to actually go inside any of the buildings, but the scale from the outside is really quite amazing."
A very good historical site. Takes you back in centuries to the 15th century. This is a very well preserved heritage site. You need to touch the place to complete your visit to BJ
"I guess taking the subway is convenient. That you will get near to the entrance of the museum. There were many people on a Saturday, very long queues at the ticket counters and they checked EACH passport. Try to go on a weekday, if you wanna beat the crowd. And they really scan your bags (they do that in many other places too) for security reasons. It's a huge place. Knowing its history helps us to admire the place better. What we usually read in prints or watch in movies was now right in front of our eyes, that is awesome. We paid RMB20 for the automatic tour information device (only tells you basic information), and we got a free pamphlet after we entered the museum. Do not buy it outside the entrance. Also, a personal tour guide costs at least RMB260 and you have to pay surcharge for each additional member in your group. It's a huge area, be ready with lots of walking. Basically Beijing is big, everywhere involves lots of walking."
"This was really worth visiting! A student ticket costs no more than 20 RMB. Please note that you have to bring your passport to purchase a ticket to the Palace Museum. The place itself is amazing. It is, of course, very touristy, but you will have that feeling of history and tradition nevertheless."
So much to see and do. It is once place not to be missed. Huge crowds. Go with the flow. Many signs in English. Buildings are fascinating. It is a vast area so leave plenty of time. Go on a good weather day = we went on a snowy day and there were still huge crowds.
"Wowee, I have always been fascinated by the Forbidden City. From the layout to the architecture, and the size of it! Be prepared for the huge crowd that you will definitely experience while visiting. That being said, it does not take long to purchase the entrance tickets as well as get in as they are pretty quick in handling the crowd. If you have a student ID or over 60 you get a 50% discount on the ticket price. Also aside from the entrance fee, you have to pay separately for the different museums inside the Forbidden City if you want to visit them. Compared to many years before, you are not allowed to enter many of the palaces/halls anymore, especially the main halls where the emperor’s throne is. You can only take a peek from outside, so be prepared to push and squeeze your way through the crowd who also want to take a look through the doors. Definitely a must see when in Beijing."
"Strongly recommended.
Some areas are still preserved if you want to see what it initially looked like, but all the paint work, while new, is a copy of what was originally there.
While going in the winter months may sound like a deterrent, don't let it put you off. Yes it was cold, but there was no where near the crowds as summer months, and we barely had to wait to get in and when inside we were not being pushed around, we just wondered around admiring the buildings.
When I went it was snowing, which in my opinion made it even better. Especially when you reach the garden in the center, it was beautiful."
"The whole forbidden city is awesome but the museum is a must do. We spend too much on jade, jade, and more jade!"
"We were not prepared for the vastness of the Forbidden City. The architecture was wonderful.
To see inside the buildings was difficult because of the dim interior and trying to see past everyone else craning for a look.
Enjoy the grounds and soak up the history.
November was cold but the tourist season is almost at a close so less people."
"We only had two hours here but there is sooo soo much to see that you could literally spend and entire day. I would suggest at least the audio tour , but if not, be sure to read all of the plaques. Once you are in, you must walk all the way through to get out. Also, be certain to have identification with you. You must present identification to obtain your ticket."
"The palace museum is pretty amazing! I usually describe a lot of the attraction but you know what, this one I won't! All i'm going to say is that it is MANDATORY to go and it MUST NOT BE MISSED.

China has a lot to offer in terms of culture, achitecture and history. Seeing it all is difficult, I can vouch for that one, but seeing it all is very rewarding."
"You cannot say you have been to Beijing unless you have at least visited the Great Wall and The Palace Museum. It is easy access via the subway and be prepared for the crowds of locals and overseas travellers. I had to show my passport at the ticket office when purchasing the tickets for entry, so prepare to bring ID along for backup.
The emperors chair was harder to see as crowds will be gathered at the front taking photos. However, the deeper I had walked in, the more excited I was to explore what had laid beyond the next wall. It was amazing to discover such a historical filled place in the centre of a modernised city."
"Second on our Viator organised one day tour, with our 'Jacky Jacky' guide finding the best photo sites and providing a detailed explanation as we went, the Palace Museum or as it seems better known the Forbidden City was as great an attraction as we had anticipated.

We were there on Tuesday 6 October, in the summer holiday time. Yes, it is busy but the numbers inside this site are controlled to a prescribed number to ensure its preservation. Only in the Palace gardens did movement become at all restricted.

There is a natural order to progress through the 'City'. You need a good guide, as we had, prior research or a detailed guide-book to make the most of your time. Appreciate the size and grandeur of the buildings, their timber construction, the colour in their internal painting and especially the intricate 'roof guardians'."
The sheer size is amazing. The different palaces are gorgeous but you can't go in only view from open doors with hundreds of other people. The insides are dimly lit and even if you could manage to get a good spot the view was muted. We hired a private driver and guide and she provided us insight into what each palace was used for as we walked and walked and walked. I think I would have preferred to use the subway and the audio tour. It's crazy but I most enjoyed after we exited the moat and wall surrounding the palace. In the sunlight it was beautiful.
"The palace was really huge and impressive, at least 2 hours needed to finish the whole journey in there.

Despite there were many tours there and was so crowded, but still it was really worth to see."
"We simply could not believe the sheer size of the Palace Museum [formerly Forbidden City]. It is rectangular in shape and our guide told us it is the world's largest palace complex covering 74 hectares. It is surrounded by a 52-meter-wide moat and a 10-meter-high wall and has more than 8,700 rooms. There is no way you could visit all of it in a day or even a week. But be sure you visit it to appreciate the beauty and size and history."
"I'm not going to lie but my day trip here was not the most pleasant of experiences due to the overwhelming crowds. I am giving this attraction a rating of 4 based on the sheer nature of what it is and its amazing story. I don't think a trip to Beijing would be complete without visit here.

I was underprepared and overwhelmed on my visit. I knew there would be crowds as I had done some research and discovered it is China's number one attraction however I was not mentally prepared for the endless pushing, shoving, stepping on feet, elbowing, tour guides shouting, endless selfies, people getting under your feet, people stopping abruptly, people running into you. Try as I might to be patient with all this chaos I have to say it ruins what should be an amazing experience.

Thats the negatives out of the way, now the positives. It is a truly amazing structure that has been UNESCO World Heritage Listed since in 1987 and listed as the largest collection of preserved ancient wooden structures in the world. The story of the Forbidden City is just amazing. I only did a small amount of reading prior to my visit and was intrigued by what I read.

I toured alone but I would say it may be worth joining a tour group to get the most out of your day and really learn what the Palace is about. The sheer size of the place is another reason to join a group as I would say they take you to the best features as a priority.

The things I would do differently next visit are: join a tour group, forget trying to take any form of decent photography, more use of elbows, be mentally prepared for the crowds."
"Amazing place to be, in the heart of the City. This is the largest ancient palatial structure in the world ! You need to stroll around for half a day, or even a full day, to get a full impression. It is well preserved, so very much worth the entrance fee."
Pay special attention to the centre axis to compare some restored areas vs the others. It is even more stunning after snow.
"Prepare to spend lots of time here. We were thinking we were at the end when our guide said we had almost reached the center. The span is over-whelming, but we could not access any inside exhibits (tour, so had no say) The exhibits we could see from the doorways were lovely but the crowds were so heavy and pushing so that none of pictures came out in focus and I really didn't get a good look. The gardens at the back were beautiful, well worth the trip through all the rest."
"My wife and I had visited this place many years ago. This was our second visit and it is good to see that the renovations and repainting have made significant progress.

It is likely that we will return for a third visit many years from now."
No visit to Beijing is complete without a visit to the Forbidden City. Just make sure you put your gym shoes on and try to visit during warmer months.
"I toured the Forbidden city on Nov 23 when it was very cold. Suprisingly crowded for a Monday. A lot of Chinese tourists were there visiting. I rented the self guided audio tour which was okay....it was only 40 yuan ( a little over $6). My unit seemed a little flaky, but it did a reasonable job. You can do the tour in about 90 minutes to see the main areas in the central part of the Forbidden City...it would take about 3 if you wanted to see all the East and West temples as well. Some tips, you need enter from the South...so the subway stop at East Tiananmen subway stop is the place to go. Exit the subway on the north east side and walk through the entrance right next to Mao's picture. Overall highly recommend."
"We had spent almost a month in China and Beijing was our last stop. So by this time we had seen a lot of ancient Chinese buildings so were a little underwhelmed at this experience. But I don't regret going as the Palace is simply amazing. The sear size of the place is mind-blowing and it is only a third of the size it once was.

You are mostly there to enjoy the architecture of the buildings and marvel at what would have been in Imperial times. Areas were built to serve specific purposes for the Emperor, his queen, concubines, children, advisors etc where all separate and structured for specific reasons, mostly to keep the Emperor safe from invading armies. Most of the structures have been re-built in modern times due to damage in earthquakes, so you're not looking at originals, but excellent replicas.

This place is huge so wear comfortable walking shoes. You don't need a guide, but we pre-arranged one and he gave us excellent information on what we were looking at, otherwise you would be just looking at buildings without the history."
"I've been dreaming about The Forbidden City for years. It did not disappoint.

Get there EARLY. The crowds can be very overwhelming. Take the train to Tiananmen Square East and get through security. Bring your passport or driver's license. Make sure you know where the bathrooms are, because you'll be looking for quite a while to find them.

Once again, get there early. The crowds aren't polite when it comes to seeing the buildings up-close. I'd recommend seeing all the major buildings first, and then taking your time to explore the Eastern and Western palaces.

Overall, this is a must-see. If you can, go up to Jingshan Park and take pictures from there. When I went, the visibility was low, so I chose to stay in the palace grounds. Enjoy!"
"The forbidden city palace is located near a subway in Beijing, and is very easy to get in. You must buy a ticket after entering the first gate, but it's worth it.
Bring comfy shoes and warm clothes if you go in the winter, most of the areas are outside. Be prepared to go through a security check.
There's a gift shop near the exit at the back, and be ready for street vendors to try and sell you things as you leave. They will haggle, and drop prices fast. We had one lady offer one thing at 100 rmb and then ended up offering another item with the first, and dropped the price to 20 rmb."
"We entered the Forbidden City at 10am. We took the buggy and their was mostly accessible access, but we did have to carry the buggy up a few stairs. Due to the cold though we need the buggy to keep our son warm-ish- bought a blanket in Beijing. Our son loved running round the open air areas and enjoyed the hall of clocks, we also did the treasure rooms, but on reflection should have as he had lost interest by then and unless you are really interested in artifacts and history you can get the feel for the city without it. I would recommend having a read of the history before you go and then either downloading a map or our small pocket guide to Beijing had a map, then you can choose what to do and what to miss out . It was worth doing to say we did it, but we were all shattered after trying to keep our little one entertained, as if you want to do it properly you need the whole day and our son got bored about an hour in."
"We took advice from a local friend, and hired a student guide and a car and driver (friends of a friend, via WeChat), and went early in the morning to Coal Hill Park at the north end, where you can hike up the hill to a pagoda with a great view of the whole Forbidden City, looking south. In the morning the park is full of local Chinese exercising and doing Tai Chi or dancing. After the park, we rejoined the car and were taken to the South entrance, off Tianamin Square where tickets are sold. We ( and huge crowds of Chinese tourists) walked through the sequence of courtyards and palaces to the north end, the Imperial Garden. For me, the architecture and the sequence is the most interesting part; with more time you could see the collections in various buildings but most of that was closed on our visit. The car met us at the north end ( facing Coal Hill Park from across the street, and we went to lunch. A fascinating first time, half day visit, of course one could go back many times, but no need to be intimidated at the idea of a huge museum."
"I paid my visit almost 6 years ago. People says this is a must to visit museum, so I went. This is a huge remain kept really well both the buildings and indoor displays.

If you plan to go and interested in historical places, this place will make you stay for a whole day."
"I allowed a half day for this and will be back for more one day. In amongst the huge buildings and pavillions the displays of clothes and jewellery are pretty amazing.
You pay an entrance and then an additional fee for the front gate and Treasury displays."
"We enjoyed learning about the history of the emperors, empresses, concubines, and the dragon lady while touring the Forbidden City. A tour guide is necessary to put everything into context. We walked over 2 miles and it was very cold. The good part about coming this time of year is less people but the wind was icy and we had to be careful walking on icy paths and stairs. For a warm break midway find the birthday celebration exhibit. It is heated and an interesting set of paintings and historical artifacts associated to the pursuit and celebrations of a long life."
"So much history. If ancient Chinese history is your thing, you might never leave. So much to see, you could easily spend as little as 1 hour here and up to an entire day. Like with any major attraction, go early and lines won't be an issue. I went with the audio guide, it was only 40 yuan. Not sure I'd recommend it, there's plenty of signs in English."
"It's best to see the Forbidden City with a guide, who can provide insight on the history and culture of the buildings and the spacious grounds. Expect to walk about a kilometer from the south gate to the north gate. And expect lots of people. I'm impressed that so many Chinese people are taking an interest to see this historic site in their country. I had not realized how large the Forbidden City would be, prior to my visit. There is still a mystique about the place."
"If you only visit one place in Beijing this is it! Please compare how buildings, decorations, plates etc was in 1422 in your country with what you see at this amazing complex. The close connection between the religious life and the ruler is similar to other countries in the same periods and interesting by itself. Bring good shoes and water."
"This is an amazing place and a must-see on any trip to China. I was blown away by the size and scale of the buildings, and the wonderful colours. Even though there are lots of visitors, you can wander around and find quiet places to drink in the architecture and decoration. Breathtaking!"
"...horrific queues!

Yes it is spectacular (and all the other positive things that are said) but the queues are the worst in the World (considerably worse than the Coliseum, Vatican, Tower of London, Burj Khalifa, Empire State, Niagara, etc - you name it). So bad we gave up on one afternoon and came back the following day in the very early morning. Be prepared for a monstrous security queue, followed by a similar ticket collection queue, followed by yet another ticket check queue."
"This is a must go, all day event. You can bring food and drink in. There a benches where you can sit down and eat. There are several rooms with throws (those for law and counsel) as well as museums with odds and ends from costumes to paintings and pottery. In addition to the beautiful architecture, there are gorgeous gardens with rocks and gazebos. Worth wondering around and getting lost in there. There is also a special exhibit. When we went it was beautiful calligraphy with drawings on rice paper scrolls and traditional blue glazed pottery (it was a temporary display and was changing the next day). I am not sure what will replace it. "
Again this was very touristy anda full of colourful tour groups all with the same coloured hats! We enjoyed walking around and exploring bu it felt so big and it was a super hot day so we couldn't stay too long plus they keep the large crowds moving forward all the time.
"This place is way too famous to not visit when you are in China. And deservedly so! It would be helpful to get prepared for the trip by reading up on history of China and this palace in particular, to better appreciate the historical perspective. For sheer scale and atmosphere, this cannot be beaten!"
"Forbidden CityThis impressive structure served as the home of emperors and their households and was the cermonial and political centre of Chinese government for almost 500 years. Built over 14 years, it consists of 980 over 72 hectares It is now a UNESCO World Heritage Site as the largest collection of ancient preserved wooden structures in the world. We were in a tour group and although it was an hour walking through, it could easily have been three hours. I imagine in summer the crowds would be unbearable. We visited in November and the crowds were bearable and we moved through quickly"
First time I visited Beijing and visited this place for the first day. A must go place the tourist should go :D
"We went with Jack the ""Dragon"" tour guide and he was quite informative. We waited patiently as he lined up to purchase our group ticket. There were lots of opportunities for photos. We went on a Saturday morning on a cool wet day after it snowed in early November. There were lots of crowds but we were able to see a lot all things considered. There is a nice museum gift/coffee shop before the gardens where many of us made purchases at set prices."
"No crowds this time of year, had been there before on a China holiday day and was difficult because of crowd. In the evening there is a walk way around the outside of the complex which is interesting by the evening light."
"Be prepared to join a long line, to walk a lot and for lots of crowds in several places. It is a well known attraction visited regularly. It represents another part of the great Chinese dynasty history. It's definitely a fantastic world historic landmark.

There are rest stops available which comes in handy with the long walk that you have to take."
The Palace Museum or the Forbidden Palace is an amazing place with so many building to view. It is a must see in Bejing.
"That's right. As all the museums around the world, you need to know even a bit about the place or the History of the country. Wasn't the best experience"
"It's tough to describe the grandeur and gloriousness of the world's most incredible palace complex in one review - it's really a waste of everyone's time to go on about how amazing and incredible a world landmark is. Instead, I'll give some tips on how to maximize your visit:

1) Buy your ticket online. The Forbidden City sells 80,000 tickets every day, and if you come too late you won't get one. The cues start around 6:30 - I got there around 7:30 and had to wait another 50 minutes before the Forbidden City opened (8:30) to buy my ticket. I also got the ire and rage of many other people in the line (In my experience, the Chinese love to cut cues but hang their heads in shame when someone calls them out) and got spat at by someone shouting ""lao wai"" who then put a finger to his throat making a cutting motion. Like the train stations, better to avoid the lines by buying tickets online.

2) Go on a day that's not smoggy. Beijing's smog problem is one of the worst in the world, and as the Forbidden City is a complex with dozens of enormous large courtyards, it may disrupt your view and photographing capabilities. If you have one day here, that may not be an option, but I went on my last day out of four because it was forecasted to rain and that always clears the air up a bit.

3) Crowds are ridiculous, but not once you get past the courtyards. Following the Temple of Heavenly Purity, you get to a number of small alleyways that made up the Royal Harem a century ago. Here, not everything is traversed by enormous tour groups, and if you're able to wiggle your way through the courtyards, you'll get here before they enter and be unluckily stuck behind crowds for the whole morning.

4) You can't get back in after you exit, so see everything in one go. I learned this the hard way - I waved my ticket in front of a guard while speaking broken Mandarin and was forcefully removed. See the museums, clock gallery, every temple you have time for, and everything else before you go. You can't come back in.

So enjoy this incredible monument, it really is worth all 5 stars and then some, and if you can jump on a tour do it because they go into some fairly intense detail that I can't quite duplicate here."
This is a main attraction to anyone visiting Beijing. Entering via Tiananmen Square the entire complex is vast and at times overwhelmed by the sheer number of visitors. It is worth the effort and with a guide you get more out of the visit as there is just so much to take in.
"Really cool to see the Forbidden City, definitely worth a visit. But a lot of tourists, and many security checks (that seemed just to be there ""for show""). They checked passports, for security checks and for ticket sales.

Be there early!

Go to the bathroom Before, since the only thing they had was a whole in the ground."
"You must go! A must do/bucket list in order to gain a sense of the Chinese Imperial (Ming & Qing) Dynasties and a symbol of China's oriental culture. We went on Tuesday so it was less crowded. We hired a private guide for the day (Yuan 500) which was well worth it as she explained lots of history. We travelled there by MTR/subway/underground which is easy, cheap and convenient. A very cold day, but a great visit. A massive complex. Fantastic architecture & history. Lots of door thresholds - not sure about wheelchair access? A great new museum Gallery of Treasures has just opened with lots of artifacts. Well worth spending several hours here overall. I also bought a book for Yuan 40 which was well worth it.
There are snack bars and toilets dotted around. Plus they have now installed outside seating for visitors. Under the Imperial Dynasties, there was only one seat: a very large, red throne for the Emperor!"
"Very impressive architecture with great detail. It is helpful to read a lot in advance or have a guide to do more than just walk through and take pictures. The crowds on a ""slow"" day in October were significant and you just had to push through if you wanted to see anything - there were no queues or politeness around."
"Also known as Forbidden City, it's a must see in Beijing. Visiting really takes to back to the Ming & Qing dynasties. Arrive early as they limit the number of visitors daily."
Worth a morning or afternoon visit to look into the oppulence of China's Regal Past. A past temple converted into a museum.
"Super crowded, but I haven't any idea why. other than the interesting arcitecture, there is nothing worth the time or money to see. You move from building to building wrestling with scads of other people with no line to peer into a window or door that you can't enter.
It is the only part of my trip that I wish I had not done."
"If you have anytime at all in Beijing, the Forbidden City is a must hit attraction. The architecture and history surrounding the place is amazing. It is well worth reading about the site prior to visiting to get a solid idea of each of the areas on the grounds.

A bit of warning: there will be heavy crowds and it could become overwhelming if you're not used to massive amounts of people. If you speak English also be mindful of the young girls. They are running a scam. The conversation will be innocent enough and they will be friendly and engaging. You'll be invited to have a special tea with them only to be hit with an exorbitant bill.

My policy was to avoid anybody who approached in a manor that seemed nefarious. Granted I talked to many people and you discern people those who are friendly and just want to share the experience."
"Located adjacent to noisy and congested communities, this palace is a wonderful place to rest, meditate and appreciate the architecture and trees a half of a century old!"
"This place is said to have entered the Guiness Book of World Records as the place in the world that comprises the most wood. All buildings are made of both brick and lots of wood. The carvings on the roofs and the paint colors are amazing. The sheer intricacies of the carvings is a wonder. Lovely gardens and courtyards are to be found spread all over. It will take about 4 hours to do a fair bit of the Forbidden City. However it is something that I recommend for you to do as it will help you understand the history of Beijing and of China, including culture. My tour guide was excellent and that's part of be reason why I loved it so much."
"We went on a weekday but the number of crowds was still overwhelming. There was a lot of queuing, locals pushing and shoving (even the local chinese kids would do this) so it would take a lot of patience to bear through that to really appreciate the place. The palace itself was still nice though and still worth seeing,"
"This is one of those landmarks that people come to Beijing for. It's just a must-see if you're here, and it's well worth the time to visit."
"Imagine a museum that is the city of long-gone emperors. Those who tried to enter the Forbidden City but were not expected, were executed. That was once upon a time. Today, it is open to about 80,000 visitors a day. Bring your official identity document such as a passport to get in. Beautifully maintained, it is a massive site, open to the public for a minor fee - there is a reduced fee for seniors and free for small children. We walked for hours looking at one building after another; of course the furnishings are long gone, but the government has developed a few small museum exhibits that a worthy of the visit. After November 1, some exhibits close early (about 3:30 PM). Be sure to see the Imperial Garden, the use of rocks and buildings makes it intriguing."
"Wow what a place.A bit confusing where to buy tickets.If you are over 60 like us take your passports and you can get in cheaper.A lot of walking as it is so huge but well worth it.Sunny day and though lots of people ,easy to walk around.More crowded around the temples and very glad we are tall as could look over people to see inside the temples as many you can't enter.Do go right to the end as the emperors private garden is so beautiful.Various places to sit along the way."
I really enjoyed visiting the palace. There are so many things to see. You need the map for the trail walk otherwise you may easily get lost. I think some buildings need the repairment but in overall they still look great and being the good things in telling the history.
"It is really impressive and huge, be prepared for a long walk! It is always crowded so be prepared :)"
Title says it all. One can only imagine the splendor in its prime. Be prepared for security checks and please bring a photo id.
"Wow - what a place (palace!) to visit. This is worth a solid half day to one day depending upon your interest level. There is a huge amount of area to cover and displays to see. Be warning though - it does get very busy - over 100,000 people per day can visit ! the queues to get in past the security gates can be very long - but do move pretty well. Breath-taking buildings and architecture and a real sense of what it was like in previous eras. The vast majority of visitors are Chinese enjoying their heritage, with a good smattering of every other nationality."
You have to go through security before you get to Tian'anmen square and the Forbidden City. It took my mom and I a minute to realize that the Palace Museum is the Forbidden City. Also we had to use the ATM there because they only take cash. But we found out they have a senior discount. It wasn't written in English but my mom deduced it from the sign. There are also a lot of people there willing to take you on a tour and they will buy your tickets for you. Mom and I decided against it and read our tourbook when going through the palace.
"The first building is fantastic after you walk under the portrait of Mao. Then you repeat this process half a dozen times until you exit. The buildings are VERY repetitive, and I'm a fan of historical architecture.The crowds are insane and we were there nearly 2 weeks after national holiday. The pushing, shoving and elbow throwing by the locals is really awful. Not to mention the omnipresent 'selfie sticks' that can and are used as weapons for getting into photo position. We should have listened to those who said it's not worth it. But suppose it's one of those sites that undeservedly gets a 'must see' status. Really, listen to this and avoid it, you're missing nothing you can't see from the outside."
"This is a huge complex of many buildings, sculptures and walkways. One plaza leads to the next, as you progress through the ""city"". I tried to imagine the entire place filled with people trying to see the emperor or doing business with other dignitaries. That made it more alive for me."
"Beautiful Chinese architecture shown in many Chines ancient movies, however it is always crowded, especially we were there on the Golden holiday. I don't know if it has the least crowded time over all. Anyway you have to buy the tickets to enter, we ""enjoying"" seeing a lot of different tourists from domestic to overseas. Basically we just walked along the center path, don't think anyone could really view every single room. The place is way too big and too many people. Security is very tight, as if you go thru the subways."
"If you have time then do everything, but if you are late in the day and don't want to spend a lot then take the side exit to the Ancestral Shrine (also called the Back Hall) it costs 2 yuan to get in (about a dime or 20p), it is set in a wonderful park and you get to walk around a piece of the forbidden city that is practically empty. As the main part is often offensively busy it make a great change!"
"The Palace is so impressive and grandeur of the imperial architectural complex. The Forbidden City was overwhelmingly embellished with various patterns of dragons. Enjoyed the Palace history, stories, rituals, culture and customs."
Lots of walking and climbing steps required. But worth it. Very crowdy. Well preserved historical monument.
"Plenty of other reviews give the detail, so I will be lazy and simply say ""not on a Saturday or Sunday""

The queues are not worth it!

My daughter told me ""all the buildings look the same and theirs nothing to see"" - I should have listened!

But of course I had to go, and while it is incredible to see and a guide is a must in order to understand the detail and history and of course that's alll wonderful and exciting, but once you've seen one building, imagined the Olympic flame, dancers and so forth, understood the Emperors life, you have kind of done it all in an hour!

Plenty of better things to see n do on a Saturday/Sunday

On a weekday it's probably quiet enough to enjoy it!"
"This is difficult to explain. It is a huge ""city"" and it's worth a visit. But much of what you see are basically huge empty squares overlooked by huge empty buildings surrounded by huge crowds. The tour became more interesting for us when we nearly reached the end. They is where the gardens are. They are beautiful and peaceful. One tip. The tour ends on the opposite side of the complex, nearly a mile from the metro entrance. The taxi drivers try to demand astronomical prices for a ride from the exit - at least 10 times the meter rates. It is terrible for the authorities to allow this, but they clearly do, as there were tourist police watching it all. Anyway, we decided to walk rather than get ripped off. I recommend having a transportation plan waiting at the exit or a pair of comfortable shoes!"
"The buildings are spectacular, but each one is not discernibly different from the previous one, foorbidden City you'll naturally visit the Palace Museum. Most people attempt to see everything in one day but be aware that there are no convenient resting places to speak of. Wear comfortable shoes, Bring water to hydrate and your camera. Son't bother taking pictures of the guards, they'll turn their backs on you."
"It seems silly to rate the Forbidden City (now Palace Museum) as ""average"" but it just wasn't my favorite place in Beijing. It isn't average, it's huge and old and you really have to go see it. Just be prepared for crowds, terrible bathrooms, more crowds and and... crowds. I had to literally push and shove to get to the fronts of buildings so that I could peek inside for 2 seconds before being pushed out of the way. Most of the buildings did not let you walk inside, some just had a doorway to look through or others had dirty windows. Really, it's a fascinating place, just crowded and hard to visit."
amazing place to visit. great architecture and amazing experience. lots to see and be amazed by! defiantly worth a trip
"A wet and cold morning to walk under Mao's picture and into the massive complex that is the Forbidden City...
We visited on a China Highlights morning tour, led by the capable Rachel, who was very good (and had great English language skills). Given the eclectic mix on the tour (party of 12) meant we had a sluggish start as we waited for the late-comers - not the best on a drizzling sky, however, standing in front of Tiananmen Square and then inside the Forbidden City, the scenario held our attention.
It is a large complex of buildings and stairs and, towards the latter half of the tour, mini-gardens and courtyards. Well worth buying the ""go anywhere"" ticket to see these little oases. Note that the public area is heaving with local tourists - which means standing your ground to ensure you get to see everything... but does give a glimpse into local ""customs"" (not sure what it would be like in the summer months?). Rachel guided us adeptly through the complex and was very knowledgeable and engaging.
Whilst not the most pleasant of weather, it is a must-do in Beijing and, well worth doing the tour with a guide (rather than self-guided) as you do pick up on some of the nuances.
Well worth visiting - and highly recommended China Highlights."
"I appreciate the history but the experience was poor. Dark, crowded and uninteresting. If you love old architecture then you"
"Leave plenty of time to walk up to the entrance and to walk though the numerous buildings. We only walked through the centre, but there are numerous buildings to the sides as well. Be prepared to push a bit if you want to see inside some of the palace buildings and take photos. There is a public garden at the exit end on the other side of the road - (Jingshan Park) for the equivalent of 20p you can climb up to a viewing point and view the Palace - pollution permitting"
"A must visit palace in Beijing, one of the biggest palace I ever visited. It was flooded with local tourists and you won't get a picture perfect scenery inside the palace. Tourist are not allow to go into the rooms, all you can do is just stand behind the bar and take a look. However, you might not even have chance to do so because the local tourists seem very keen to do so and you really
have to squeeze into the crowd. It took me 4 hrs to cover all the rooms that stated in the audio guide (you have to pay extra for audio guide)It's worth it because without the guide you won't know anything about it. Some of the rooms were locked and visitor are not allow, I supposed it really depends on your luck whether you can cover all of the rooms. You really have to plan your route well inside the palace because one end the another end is far apart, else you will have to waste time walking here and there to look for the room you wish to see. Well, if you are just a tourist that like to ""been there and done that"" by all mean."
MUST DO while in Beijing. A lot to see and learn about Chinese history. Offers many views and impressive architecture.
The Palace Museum also called the Forbidden City was part of our tour for a day in Beijing. This place was beautiful and huge. After going through several sections however I felt that everything was starting to look the same. To get a chance to view many areas like the throne room be prepared to push and shove. While that is not the way I am use to doing things that is the culture and if you want to see things you will have to adapt. With a good tour guide this place can be explored for hours. Just bring water and comfortable shoes.
"You will be surprised to find more art exhibits from other Nations than it's for the Chinese themselves...there certain exhibits items weren't available when we visited and in order to defeat the crowds all around you is a task alone by itself. As they were limited to 80k people visiting per day to these attractions yet, there seem still a lot of people from dawn to dusts.

We had actually got to see some of Art Exhibits pertaining to Africa which was quite interesting and yet (and I could be wrong) it was a bit disappointing to find out that some of famous exhibits (of the Chinese Arts) weren't available at that time.
.If you're someone enjoys observing art pieces like in the European countries, ie., London, Paris or even Rome...those rules do not applied here....it's pretty much of now you see it, now it's time to go. The conclusion was that there are no chairs are available for your quiet enjoyment, either."
"Lots of walking! The area is pretty big. Lots of different buildings for different activities, meaning and history. I highly recommend the audio tour, they give you an electronic map that has suggested routes based on how long you want to spend there, and shows where you haven't gone yet, where you are etc. For I think 40RMB. I chose to just walk around where I was interested and the audio explains based on area. Some exhibits were closed. But the rest of the place was big enough to fill my time. I was there during end of October and the weather was perfect, I didn't even need my sweater. There's a garden, places where the different dynasty members slept, worshipped depending on for what, and viewing areas of jade, weapons, clocks, etc. It's a lot to look at. This is easily accessible with the subway line."
A lot to see - however beware that the structure is quite repetitive and that you can't go inside most of the buildings - still a must go! Do not go on a weekend or be prepared to queue a bit (not as much as you'd expect seeing all that people). Also - you can only enter on one side and exit on the other. (which are far away 15-20 min walk)
"As there is a lot of walking, ideal time to visit is when there is less crowd and the weather is nice."
"We went on a very busy Saturday to the forbidden city (officially the Palace Museum now) and the weather was perfect. It was fascinating and beautiful to see.

We went independently because the forbidden city was in walking distance of our hotel. We had our own Lonely Planet guide and map and our son used this to direct and guide us everywhere. Make sure you go to the side and through the side gates to explore regions that on not on the main tour trail.

Since the middle of this year the forbidden city is limited to 80000 visitors a day and the Palace Museum website sells 40000 tickets in advance on their website. However as a foreign tourist you can't buy online - firstly the website is in Chinese only, and if you use google translate you still can't register because you must have a Chinese phone number to successfully register. we were worried about this given we were going on a Saturday but going in the morning there was no problem buying our own tickets. You must have your passport with you to buy tickets. We had a personal guide to the wall the next day and she advised that on busy days the tickets had sold out by 1pm so I guess if you know that you are going on a busy day make sure you go in the morning.

This is a very extensive area and there are many different areas to explore . Don't miss the visit."
the Palace museum offers many interesting exhibits connected with the history of Chinese Dynasties and valuable information
Don't rush. Spare more time to check out the collections. Everything is antiques. This is the largest collection of modern Chinese History
"This is not so much a review of the Forbidden City/Imperial Palace/Palace Museum. Most people go up the middle of the palace and see the three great audience halls and the garden in back before exiting out the north door. I want to point out the things most tourists miss: the various little museums hidden away in the west and east residential quarters of the palace. These were the quarters of the former Empress Dowagers, Cixi and Ci'an. In the maze of rooms and buildings on the west is a museum of artifacts of Imperial Concubines. There is also a collection of the toys belonging to the Last Emperor, Aisin-Gioro Puyi. On the other side is a small museum of bronze ritual vessels, another of ancient jade, and another of porcelain. There is also a special museum of Qing Treasures, but that requires a separate ticket. Also, at any given time there might be another special exhibit. During one of my earlier visits was an exhibit of clocks and timepieces owned by the Imperial family. And throughout the various buildings and apartments one can find a number of museum pieces sitting out for the tourists to see. Tour groups never allow enough time for people to see these treasures, but if you come on your own, plan on spending an extra hour or two and explore the entire Palace, and not just the Hall of Supreme Harmony. But if you go to the audience halls when it is crowded, be very careful. Do not keep your wallet in your back pocket, as that is an easy target for the pickpockets who work the area during peak tourist times. I once watched a foreigner scream in anguish when he realized he had just been robbed while standing in a crowd before the throne of the Emperors. By the way, like all the Chinese museums I visit, I have extensively photographed it and placed it on my GaryLeeTodd.com website which I make freely available to everyone."
"It just one of those attractions you can't not see when you come to Beijing.

It has a small amount of awe associated with visiting. Though this has worn thin on me for a number of reasons.

For one, none of the artifacts inside are original, well maybe some but most were taken out of the mainland during the cultural revolution and can now be seen in Taipei.

For another, it's just boring, I suggest walk straight through as fast as you can, exit on the north side, cross the street and make it to the top of Jingshan Park, the summit and the view it offers will blow your mind!"
The place is so vast that you need a lot of time to explore the nooks and corners but it is really worth it. Steeped in historical things and as usual very crowded.
"I was told that to go to China before October 7 would be crazy due to a holiday or festival. We arrived at midnight on October 7th. We explored the Palace Museum and the rest of Beijing on October 8th fairly freely, since most all the locals had gone back to work! I say if you are going, this is a great time of year. I still had to squeeze my way through to take photos, but honestly, even my friend (a tour guide) said it didn't seem like many people compared to usual. I highly recommend seeing the Palace museum. What a rich historic gold mine it is!"
"It was not much as a museum to me but more a palace to walk around and feel the atmosphere as well as admire the unique details on the buildings, stairways etc. There were a lot of people there on Sunday, but the place is huge so it didn't feel much crowded except the entrance. Hint - foreigners are required to show their passports when buying the tickets!"
Did a quick walk through of the forbidden city didn't get a chance to see much. With our guide not suitable for people with mobility problems.
"A MUSEUM!!! A n insight to ancient Chinese history,
What is beauty today, would have been unimaginable to the general populace at the time.Apparently, there had previously been some looting of artefacts etc, so rooms are now limited/ roped off to preserve what is remaining; LOOK, NO TOUCH!!!
How can one describe the scene before one's eyes, I can not!!!
See for yourself. I spent 41/2 hours here, and didn't see all, because, I was visualising each section with my imagination, like a movie set, and time was my worst enemy!"
"yes you are surrounded by chinese tour groups, still amazing. get the audio guide and be forewarned that bathrooms are not delightful at all"
"I would imagine on a weekday a trip to the Forbidden City would be quite enjoyable. On a Sunday...not so much. It was very crowded and some of the visitors were simply rude...pushing, shoving, rushing to get in front of you for some photo op. Many sections of the Forbidden City are quite repetitious in look the inner sections are quite different and ornate. It was somewhat disappointing that many of the places you would like to see...you cannot get past the door and it is very dark inside so visibility was not great. Also, where there were windows, the windows were extremely dirty so again hard to see what artifacts were inside."
"Ok. You're in Beijing so you HAVE to go to the Forbidden City right? Yes, otherwise everyone will wonder why you didn't and you'll always wonder what you missed.

We visited the ""exterior "" of the Palace the day before, as part of an excellent Bike Beijing cycle tour. That let us orient ourselves a bit. We then went in the evening on foot (to see Tiananmen Square mostly) but to check out how to get in. Note: it's a one way in one way out deal - you can't get out the way you came in. This is true of the ticket area and the main palace/city.

We were advised to arrive for 8am to get tickets (they're limited in numbers) but due to hefty security checks around Tiananmen we got there at about 8:30 but were inside by 9am. Your passport is needed for a ticket and helps you get through security checks.

As many others have said expect a scrum/mosh pit/fight club/etc around popular spots and be prepared to be elbowed shoved etc by tiny octagenarian Chinese, even if you are a 6 footer built like a brick privy. Many could find it uncomfortable (and watch your pockets) but we found it hilarious! It's not a reason not to go, if you don't fancy a little wrestling then just don't get into the scrum to look through the window of that particular palace and you won't have a problem!

The good bits (for me were on the West side as the courtyards, palaces and gardens were quiet and tranquil. It was hard to imagine being in busting Beijing! Some sections in the south east were also quiet and nice to see (the ceramic exhibit for example)!

We didn't feel a tour guide was needed, we saw lots in our 4 hours, the best of which is off the south to north main axis. Most Chinese visiting seem to proceed at breakneck speed south to north up a broadly central path.

There's free maps inside (in various languages) and you can get them from Gate of Supreme Harmony on far side of 1st courtyard through Wumen gate. There's an automatic guide available for an extra 40RMB over the standard 60RMB entrance. It would seem unnecessary to hire a guide or join a tour (to me but don't let that stop you)!

There are plenty of hawkers trying to sell guidebooks etc. There are also official shops in the Forbidden City too. Beware the ""overly friendly"" ones as you walk towards Tiananmen and the City - they probably want to charge you silly money to be ""a guide"".

Many people seemed to bring picnic lunches and sit on the benches in the sun (note that all bags will be scanned and you may be patted down before entry)! There seemed to be lots of toilets (some busy) and the one I used was clean and modern with a mix of Asian and western facilities. Some have said bring loo roll and I would advise finding one in a quiet area off the beaten central axis.

There's lots to see and take in but after 2 to 3 hours it gets a bit samey and you begin to tire of red buildings. At some point you'll realise why the Chinese are whizzing through.

There's lots of English signage so that's all good news. Unless you speak no English. Then it's not so good news obviously.

Most people leave by northern gate but we backtracked to East Gate for ease of return to our hotel.

So, go see it but expect some queuing, some rude Chinese tourists and to be walking round for a few hours. In return you'll see the scale and majesty (something photos don't convey) and possibly even find peace and tranquility at the heart of Beijing.

Or a mosh pit.

If you want it.

Enjoy."
This is a very interesting place to visit at any time except during the National Day holidays where many people visit. With that number of people it is almost impossible to stand and study things as you just get moved along by the crowd.
You can enter from either ends of the forbidden city but both options leave you fighting with the large crowds. There are small pockets off the main central stretch (on both sides) that are quieter and interesting for the glimpse of what everyday life was like within the palace walls. It's a shame that this magnificent structure hasn't been more regally or meticulously restored. Not all parts are accessible so what you see is the grand structure and design but not the finer aspects. The museum exhibitions were sketchy and could have been better curatored.
It's really a misnomer. The published pics aren't of the museum itself. It's just a collection of pics and a few artifacts with no international translation. The nearby shop is rather good though.
It is breathtaking and awe inspiring and beautiful. You will have lots of people (mostly locals) with you wherever you go so be prepared and open your mind to it - there is something very charming in observing an old Chinese person seeing for the first time his culture and history so superbly presented. Take your time with plenty of rests so don't feel bad to sit and watch the people go by. Take your own drinks and snacks and loo paper. I absolutely loved every moment I was there.and fell I could go back again ... several times
"The forbidden city is huge and there are lots of people. We had our own guide who warned us to be careful with our belongings, both she and we wore our backpacks on our front. It was a lot of walking so be prepared for that. The place is huge but quite magnificent. Another must do on a visit to Beijing"
visited the place during the time of closing for the day...was overcrowded and had to wait so long for the security checks and getting the tickets...but the wait was worth...advisable to go early since it needs a full day...historical evidence of the dynasties wealth and power...
"This is a nice attraction for kids studying Asian studies, as they can get a better idea of the history of it all. It was good for pictures outdoors but not much else to see as most artifacts are not present. Expect large pushy crowds. It rained the day I visited, so an umbrella is definitely in order as it is all outdoor waking the grounds."
You need to plan to get there early because there is so much to see and it is a long walk around. Be careful of cheats who will try and make money out of you. Two ladies offered to buy me coffee so that they could practice their English then tried to make me cover 1/3 of the bill. I didn't fall for it then later discovered that the bill was ten times higher than it should have been. Also beware of illegal guides.
"Almost everybody had seen several forbiden city pics. But, as in the pyramids in Egypt, you can not imagine the real dimension, the real size until you are there. The desing, the names of the buildings, the strict symbolism of all is awesome. Be ready to spend 4 hours or more in the middle of other time. Crowded even in the middle of october, a lot of local tourist and school children"
"A world heritage site and quite rightly so. The site itself is huge so allow a large portion of your day to visit. Entrance in high season is 60R but beware; although visitor numbers are limited to 80,000 per day a sometimes vigorous ""scrum"" develops at the optimum photo spots. You also need to be aware that the exits are to the east and west gates and not at the main entrance."
"It is built on a huge plot of land that's 961 metres long and 753 metres wide along the north-south axis. In actuality, it is about 2 degrees or so off.

So a good amount of walking inside is expected so make sure you put on a pair of comfortable walking shoes. Images of a whole battalion of Chinese soldiers (those I saw in movies) came to my mind, as I imagined how it must have been like during the Ming and Qing Dynasties when people stood in military formations in absolute obedience if not awe of the son of heaven.

At several places, I had to walk up flights of steps. Elevators and lifts were not invented yet, not even electricity, so I can imagine the poor guys heaving and panting who had to carry the emperor up and down, whenever he did not feel like walking or climbing.

The Palace is said to have 9,999 rooms but honestly, I could not even count 100. Oh well, most of the buildings were locked and so, nobody could count and verify. Like the eastern palaces. I could only go inside and see the courtyards but not inside the buildings.

The Imperial Garden was beautiful. Mainland tourists outnumber foreign ones and it was next to impossible to take photos without strangers in them. To enjoy this place, be prepared to set aside one full day...and feel like you are an emperor, if you so wish. Haha."
"Go there early to avoid the crowds. Massive huge complex, it will take you a few hrs to walk the grounds.Tiananmen square is next to it. Be prepared for the constant jostling & pushing among the Chinese crowds just to get to the front for a photo. Despite this, worth a visit to see the impressive complex in all its grandeur."
"The place is huge with huge crowds getting in there,we arrived around 11 and i waited 15 mins to get tickets. You need to take your passport. Once in, well, your in and you go through, south to north. It is a scrum to see inside the buildings which are dark and a bit samey from the outside. The ceramics hall was good, the clock hall less good, dusty exhibits most of which were from London or France.

However when you consider when it was built it is impressive."
"It was so beautiful, but it was such a bummer that it was so crowded. The complex is very unique and is a must-see site! Go early so you can try to escape some of the crowds. Do not go on any Chinese public holidays or you will be swarmed by Chinese tourists. Overall, very unique and interesting to see."
"I very much enjoyed the Forbidden City but fighting Chinese tourists to the front of crowds for a photo was annoying. The Chinese have a reputation among the surrounding Asian countries for being rude tourists, and you can definitely see why here. Expect elbows in the stomach and selfie sticks in your face at certain buildings in the complex.

Other than that, the complex is great. I would definitely recommend getting a tour guide or an audio headset guide for your visit, because there is very little written on signs inside. You will get more information and a fuller experience with a guide. You can spend several hours here easily, so plan your day accordingly."
"This is a magnificent structure as part of the massive Forbidden City complex. The details associated with this site are unique, standing out at all angles. It really is something to see, in a place you must really see to appreciate the total grandeur."
"I recommend you go to Forbidden city early, for the Tiananmeng Square flag raising ceremony (Google schedule, it changes daily). Since the museum is right behind the square, go get yourself some local breakfast, then walk to the museum when it's not too packed.

The place is HUGE. You need at least 2-3 hours to browse. There are small exhibitions within the palace that you can go into. Some requires additional ticket, some don't. (If you purchase all inclusive ticket by the main entrance should cover everything) I bought the basic ticket and it still took me 3 hours.

It will be crowded, of course. drink enough water as food vendor indoor will charge $$$ for a bottle of water. Bring toilet paper(tissue paper) with you, some bathrooms run out of paper quick!

I would also suggest you to read little bit about the history of the palace. It will make your trip more interesting."
"I'm still looking for something really worth to write about this place . Nothing , so far .
Big ? Yes . Chinese style ? Obvious .
But , what else ? Nothing . Just a big temple , similar all , once you see first , all seen . Well , you are in Beijing so It's a must , but honestly , what a disappointment ."
"Very impressive complex for its size and luxury, and as a display of the lavish lifestyle and wealth of several Chinese dynasties. Spend at least one full day, even if you don't go into the numerous small museums within. But the ""Water Pavilion"" is a surprise for its relative modernity and its style. It was commissioned by the Dowager Empress to demonstrate that China was becoming a ""modern"" country, but was never actually completed due to lack of funds, and then, of course, the end of the Qing (Manchu) dynasty in 1911. Also cool are the almost ""twin"" lions guarding one of the palaces: the male has his paw on the globe, signifying power, and the female has hers on the cub, signifying maternity and the home. As a child, the last emperor Pu Yi, had some of the ""spirit"" thresh-holds modified so they could be temporarily removed when he wanted to ride his bicycle through the palace grounds. The huge water pots were used to store water from the ""golden river"" that runs thru the grounds for early fire protection. In colder months they were covered with quilts and charcoal fires were lit underneath."
"Pros:
1) Magnificent palace - madness in its size and its architecture beauty
2) Takes a while to soak all of it in, so do take your time

Cons:
1) The madness of the crowd (Chinese tourists) really ruined it for me. MInd you we went on a day where the traffic was considered low. Tour groups with uniform caps kept coming like an endless wave of people (it is NOT an understatement). The endless pushing, shoving, these tourists redefined the word rude and crude. Especially when trying to take a peak of the Dragon's throne. Be prepared to be molested in a major way.

To avoid the crowd we skipped a lot of the main attractions. Even then this place does not disappoint. My only gripe is that it would be nice to see more of the interior of these buildings.

Awesome palace, the crowd Not so.

You've been warned."
"The buildings are magnificent and worth seeing.
It's worth mentioning you need ID to get tickets , we didn't know but fortunately had copies if passports which they accepted, also I got a discount for being a senior.
We made our own way there but think a better option is to go with a tour as it makes it much easier.
It cost 60 cry admission, 40 for earphone commentary and extra admission to clock tower etc.

It was very busy and there wasn't a great lot of white tourists making it a bit uncomfortable for two white ladies on their own being constantly stared at and photographed.
Anyway back to the palace lots of buildings looking very similar separated by big courtyards.
It was interesting listening to the commentary about the history of China and the different buildings.

It does take hours to see everything ,we were there for 4 hours before leaving exhausted and not seeing everything.

Worth seeing but go as part of tour and allow plenty of time."
I recommend you to have a map before start to exploring this historical site as the area is too big and you might get lost in it. You can get the audio guide at only RMB 20 to understand more on the history and stories behind this forbidden city.
"stunning architecture, hard to believe the expertise so long ago.very afflulent at the expense of the ordinary civilian"
It was lovely and absolutely amazing for people who appreciate Chinese history. Ppl who don't understand the culture may find it bored tho. I was the one enjoying while my companion finds it very boring n wants to leave after a while. I'll definitely go for a second visit to satisfy my crave for the culture!
A great way to get a good understanding of the history of this fascinating country! You'll need to allocate several hours!
"It is striking for the magnitude of the complex, but i'm not fan of Beijing, so, i can't say that i felt enthusiastic about it. But if you want to go to Beijing, this is a place you cant' miss."
"Really cool place! Absolutely huge and obviously a lot of history. 60RMB entry fee, maybe a touch excessive but its got to be done if you're here.!"
"Having already visited the Temple of Heaven and the Summer Palace, this felt pretty similar but on a much grander scale.
The buildings are spectacular, but each one is not discernibly different from the previous one. Going through one elaborate gate or hall into a large stone courtyard just to be faced with another gate or 'hall' and another courtyard felt a bit like Groundhog Day.

We paid 60 RMB each to get in (you'll need your passports at the ticket office) and each exhibition was a further 10 RMB each, payable at a small ticket office near each exhibition entrance.

We visited the Gallery of Clocks and Watches in the Hall for Ancestral Worship and it was very good. An excellent array of clocks from all over the world, some of which were extremely elaborate and impressive.

The Gallery of Treasures in the Palace of Tranquil Longevity on the other hand was not worth the extra admission.

Make sure you leave enough time to relax and enjoy the surroundings in the Imperial Garden towards the northern end of the Forbidden City as it is lovely.

Buying drinks inside is ok as prices are only slightly higher than local shops (18 RMB for 3 bottles of juice/water).

When you head out into the street (Jingshan Qianjie), watch out for rip-off taxi drivers who don't want to use a meter for your fare. One quoted us 50RMB which we haggled down to 20 but on getting in to the taxi he asked for €20. Given that the fare should have been around 20 RMB, we promptly got out and walked!

We spent the best part of a day inside the Forbidden City and I would say it's definitely worth visiting, but be prepared for a lot of repetition in the architecture/layout."
"Once you're in the Forbidden City you'll naturally visit the Palace Museum. Most people attempt to see everything in one day but be aware that there are no convenient resting places to speak of. Wear comfortable shoes, Bring water to hydrate and your camera. Son't bother taking pictures of the guards, they'll turn their backs on you. Strange, fascinating things to see. You may find some of the English translations on the exhibits a bit baffling, never mind. It's part of the charm."
It's quite impressive to see the immensity of this palace but it does get monotonous as every building looks exactly the same as the one before and there isn't much to see other than the exterior of these 800 buildings.
"I don't really like it when you just can't stand still long enough to see everything
That's what this place was like
Way too many people
But there were a lot of beautiful things to glimpse at & gave me lots of memories of Beijing to take back home"
We entered through the front and the place is just overwhelming. Too beauteous to even try to describe. It was an experience I will never forget.
"No trip to China is complete without the Palace Museum/Forbidden City. The architecture is stunning, and the little tidbits of information provided by most rooms and items is absolutely fascinating. I guarantee you'll leave this place having learnt something, whether novice or pro."
It was wonderful to see the beautiful artwork and I was afforded the opportunity to purchase an amazing piece by a special art show they had on site. Now I have this piece in my home to always remind me of this incredible experience. (December 2012)
it's realy nice to see the place since it's realy known but if you don't have a lot of time it's much better to see the summer palace
"The former imperial palace complex of the Ming and Qing emperors of China stands majestically in the centre of Beijing. Was awestruck and mesmerized by grandeur, architecture and beauty of this monument of human achievement. Once in Beijing, this is the place to go after the great wall."
"This is on top of the list of attractions in Beijing. Although 700 years old, home to 24 emperors of the Ming and Qing Dynasties, this complex of about 9999 rooms over 170 acres has been well preserved and maintained in its original form."
There is so much to see in the Forbidden City that I did not spend a lot of time here. Download a map before you go and you will be all set.
"A surreal experience, if you want an insight into Chinese culture this is the place to be it transforms you back in time. The size is unbelieveable so allow time. The only negative is when you come out of the city everyone is touting for tax's and rickashaws.
This not suitable of wheelchairs, they have wheelchair access but it is a struggle"
"It is only interesting if you listen closely to the stories from audio guide. Tells the sad life of the people living in the palace, explain the structure of the palace and the symbolic meaning of the statues etc."
"I went to the forbidden city already twice and everytime is a magic experience. The colors, the buildings, the garden, the trees, the meaning of animals, symbols, ancient history we do not know in depth about China. Go with a guide, listen to the various explanations on the life starting in the fifteenth century, Get lost on the small avenues between the buildings, savor the beautiful colors wanted by the Ming dynasty. Well ....you know what you have to do."
"Can not get of the sheer size of this place which we did on a free day in Beijing, here and a fantastic Silk Factory all part of our tour arranged by Greatwall Trekclub Tours"
We got down in front of Tianmen square to enter forbidden city through the south gate. You need to walk from south out of the north gate and it takes quite a while going from building to building. You can buy tickets for the Palace Museum entry at CNY 60. Foreigners need to present their passports to buy tickets and do note that there is a limit of 85000 visitors a day so do go early if you are not going through tour guides. We reached around 1130 and got tickets though it was a national holiday and there were large crowds. There are guides who will catch hold of you and offer their services if they see you are a foreigner. However we didn't take any guide and the free brochure you pick up from inside is quite enough for you to navigate around the large complex. There are around 800 plus buildings but we didn't explore east and west but just walked north to south. There are signs in English mentioning what each building was for so that was enough for us along with the brochure that had a map of the complex explaing about the buildings. Glad we didn't spend on guides.
"The entire complex is one. And different elements should not be listed a s different attractions. The forbidden city, now known as the palace museum, is a massive place. minimum two hours of walking.

But, if you are visiting Beijing, this is a must visit place. You cannot miss it. Yes, it is crowded, but that adds to the experience."
"I think it is a bad idea to list separate components of Forbidden City as separate attractions on TA as viewer may not get a complete picture of attractions in Beijing. In my opinion, Forbidden City and Great Wall are must visited places in Beijing. Of course, Forbidden City is a very big place and you will be visiting a big palace with many buildings included. Make sure that you visit the beautiful garden for the king. I will not make detailed review as you will need to read a chapter from any tourbook to be ready for your visit.

My first few days in Beijing was great because Chinese Government limited pollution from cars, factories. They had a great parade on early September when we visited. As a result, clear, blue sky and little traffic can be seen in my pictures.

If you look at my previous reviews, I tend to organize my trip BUT in China, I strongly recommended to join a guided tour as less than 1 in 10 people there can speak little English. By joining a guided tour, you skip a long line at every entrance area, no need to show your passport and no need to use “pretty useless audioguide” which is the reason for many negative reviews on TA. If you need more information than an average tour guide can provide, please do your homework and do some reading at your local library before coming to China."
"Excellent because of its history, scale. Lots of little details to admire, especially the gardens at the end."
"The museum carries out a south-to-north unidirectional tour route. Visitors can only enter through the Meridian Gate (Wumen),south gate of the museum and leave from the Gate of Divine Prowess (Shenwumen)north gate or East Prosperity Gate (Donghuamen). Three to four hours is enough for touring the central part and if you have interest in exploring more about the imperial palace, more time need to be spent in the west and east wings. I would recommend roughly 4 to 6 hours to complete this Palace Museum(Forbidden City,Beijing).

It would preferably have a guide or at least read up on this place even though there are some write up in English but mostly very scantily written up. I was informed there are audio guide being sold. Do expect huge crowds of people if during peak period/seasons. Would recommend to visit during off peak seasons or non public holidays of China if you like to slowly take in the beauty of this place which is full of splendid painted decoration on these royal architectural building wonders."
"It is naturally a must for Beijing. A very important, impressive and interesting site. However there is no particular need to stress yourself to see everything as the architecture is quite consistent and...well..harmonious as the Chinese wanted it to be."
enjoyed taking the Palace Museum tour for the second time for me and the 1st visit for my wife. Takes a few hours to really explore everything to offer. Must show your passports nowdays to gain entry. Some limited food options inside to choose from
If you go to Beijing you must see this place. (AKA The Forbidden City.) Go in the afternoon after the tour groups have gone. I walked right up to the ticket window and got right in. But I spent a solid 4 hours from there. I bought the english language audio guide which added a lot even though many signs are in English. There are two additional areas at extra admission fee and they are worth the small cost. This place is BIG. Prepare for a lot of walking. You will enter in the south and likely exit at the north unless you want to walk all the way back. But there is no subway near the north exit to you must walk even further or take a taxi when leaving. This is a don't miss attraction when you go to Beijing!
"Spent 4 hours here wandering through the grounds, buildings, and gardens. Loved it! Even though it was busy when I was there (it was a national holiday), it was still possible to find quiet areas away from the tourists. Be sure to bring your passport, as you will need to show it when purchasing a ticket. Try to get there early to beat the big crowds."
It s better to go with a guide or buy a book about the palace. Because there nothing written anywhere inside. August is a hot and humid month in beijing so buy an umberella and take water or juices
"Cheap and lots of history!
Of course crowded but this is a place to check out!

Try to be here early!"
"Arrived at Qianmen subway and then took a while to walk to the entrance, once there though buying tickets and entering were very simple - make sure you have ID though otherwise you cannot get a ticket.
Inside was layer after layer of halls and palaces each one serving its own function. The throne rooms were difficult to get close to due to no queuing etiquette and lots of pushing.
Just as you think you are done, there is something else to see and by the end you are palaced out.
The gardens are the rear are one of the highlights.
Go there, see it but don't expect any personal space to enjoy it.
P.S. The palaces in Seoul were much better."
"Sadly no longer ‘forbidden’ so expect huge crowds as you pass through this huge complex of palaces that stretch from the Gate of Heavenly Peace.
The tourist authorities haven’t yet quite got handle on exhibiting interiors so expect to be underwhelmed with glimpses you get into the palaces.
There are ‘five star’ toilets about half way through; that's five stars on a European scale of seven. Top tip – always carry your own supply of toilet paper!"
"If you're in Beijing, you have to go to the Forbidden City. Expect crowds- as you should at all tourist attractions in China. The site is massive and difficult to navigate for those with disabilities. Definitely recommend a tour guide so you know what you're looking at. Be sure to rub the knobs on the doors for good luck and don't miss the gardens.

As a bonus, my hotel was nearby, so I was able to run around the exterior in the early morning. You'll see lots of fishermen at the moat."
"The Palace Museum aka Forbidden City is a large complex of mostly restored, ancient (ca. 1400 AD) buildings in Beijing. It was declared a World Heritage Site in 1987 and is listed by UNESCO as the largest collection of preserved ancient wooden structures in the world. It's scale can be overwhelming - to properly visit all the sections would take weeks, However, a few hours are enough for a visitor to get the general idea."
"We started the walk from Tianmen square and as we were walking towards the palace the horror began. Security check! That served as a sneak peek of how crowded the palace will be.
Being in China before their national holidays was a tormenting experience. Never go to China in the first 2 weeks of October!!!
Walking among millions was absolutely frustrating. Of course we were prepared for the crowds, but this was impossible.
We really tried to keep up a good spirit, but it was harder and harder after every new gate we entered. It all looked the same.
I truly regret entering the palace, because seeing it from above was breathtaking and gave a better feeling of how big the Forbidden city is.

I apologize for the negativity in this review, but regardless the crowds and the rain, still not worth the nerves."
We loved our time at the Forbidden City. It is well worth buying an interactive map and the audio tour as there is just so much to this place. Easy to spend a half day at least here. Some of it is currently closed as previously mentioned but I believe this is due to restoration work and there is still plenty to see here.
"Make sure you take in the Palace Museum while in Beijing well worth the visit. A great collection of very ancient artifacts.
If you like old history artifacts take this site in"
Just at beautiful... Also known as the forbidden city. Easy to spend half a day if not a day here. Really well preserved and restored. The signage is good and in both Chinese and English. Much of the city is still closed but I believe the are restoring more and opening it next year.
"Must go place!

Extremely interesting architecture and history!

Not expensive to get in!

Go with a Guide, this way you will not get lost inside of such a huge place!

Guide will take you to the right spots!

A complete tour should last around 3 hours."
I had no idea how huge the Palace would be. As others have stated it is very crowded. Our tour group did not walk into the side passages which were even more crowded so we did not get to see it all. It was very impressive and definitely worth a visit.
"The place is huge and you can spend hours walking around from one building to another.There are a few buildings with various interesting artifacts to explore.Worth visiting for the historical value.Best to get there early as they only have an 80,000 limit."
"Wow - the size and scale is amazing and you don't get to see all of it. Get there early as they restrict numbers to 80,000 per day I gather. We were there at 9 am on the Sunday and already 30,000 tickets sold. We hired a remote audio guide - set by GPS, which worked quite well. Definitely a must see if you are in Beijing, but be prepared for crowds and a lot of pushing and shoving from other tourists."
"The Forbidden City is the erstwhile abode of the royal family. It lies in the heart of the city at the Tiananmen Square.

It was earlier closed to commoners & hence, the name Forbidden. Now, it's open to public and has acres of gardens, monuments & walkways.

It's a great place to stroll provided the weather is conducive."
"I guessed it's a must go place when you are in Beijing. At least once.

The palace is huge and very very crowded. On top of the foreign visitors, there's many groups of visitors from other part of China visiting as well. You need to squeeze with the many tour groups (basically different groups are wearing different colours cap) to catch a closer glimpse at the various hall and court etc.

Do find a nice corner, ignore the touts that are going around within the palace asking whether you are keen on Great Wall Day Tour, take a good look at the vast palace and imagine the splendour of it in the olden days."
"May be a long and tiring tour, but you have to do it to appreciate China's long and ancient history."
"this place is huge and really beautiful. all the buildings, the ornaments, the colours, the history, the size of it, it's a really nice place to visit and spend a full day."
"A guide makes all the difference here I feel - to show you the highlights and bring out the history and grandeur of the palace. A pity we didn't see the side shows, as it would have taken far longer than the kids could endure - the place is massive! Spent about two and a half hours, including a fast food break.

One thing Beijing lacks is interesting children's guide books on the attractions for its non-Chinese speaking visitors, which would have made a good souvenir for the children. They should take a leaf out of the British Museum's book for this."
This place is almost an enigma. It is beautiful and so big that two things happen...you cannot see it all (both due to size and not being allowed in some buildings) and some areas are not well kept. But it still a must see when in Beijing.
"There is an incredible amount of people visiting, mainly Chinese. For Chinese, the Great Wall and Forbidden City are the 2 things to visit in their life... and keep in mind there are 1200mio of them. Stay away from the center line to avoid being pushed around and get a chance to find some emptier spots. It's a wonderful place and my favorite moments where those sitting in a quiet spot listening to the audioguides storys about concubines and their tragic careers within the palace... Audioguide well worth the money by the way."
The palace is beautifully preserved with the possibility of hiring guides on spot. Would recommend reading up on its history before visiting
"High expectations for the Forbidden City, truly one of China's cultural and historical icons. Yet ultimately a very disappointing attraction. Despite its grand size and imposing nature, there is very little to see of the city with much off limits. Neither of us enjoyed it too much, maybe a tour would have been better."
Fantastic. As usual need 3 days to see it all. Recommend good walking shoes. If you have not been before rent one of the electronic guides. Buying tickets requires Chinese ID or international passport.
"I suppose I should start this review by saying that it has always been a dream of mine to visit the Forbidden City. That said, I can say that it totally lived up to my expectations. It was breathtakingly beautiful.

A little bit of reality though. If you aren't as enthusiastic as I was about seeing this ancient city, and particularly if you dislike crowds, this might not be an enjoyable experience.

There are a lot of people here. At the entrance, loudspeakers will tell you they have limited entries to 80,000 (!) people per day to prevent too much damage on the site. I suspect every one of those 80,000 turned up at 9am as I did. Take a patience pill of it'll be a long day.

If you'd like to see anything in one of the great halls, experience in a mosh pit or rugby scrum is a prerequisite. Just remember that the throngs of people will literally elbow their own grandmothers in the face for a good shot (seriously though, I saw someone do that).

Take it all In good humour and you'll have a great time. I found the local visitors friendly and despite the crowds I was able to find a few quiet spots to rest."
"LOCATION: just very near the Tiananmen Square. You can't miss it.

COMMENTS: a must if you want to understand the culture and the historical depth of Chinese. Just awesome walking around, and seeing some marvelous artifacts.

Bring some water, umbrella/hat, and prepare to walk for 2 hours."
"Not to be missed. To think you walk the path where only emperors could tread is truly a thrill. Beautifully organized, safe and wonderful things to see."
"It is a must go when you visit Beijing. The place is huge in size as well as in history; over 600 years of history. Ironically that is exactly the problem. There is simply nothing anyone can do to properly maintain and upkeep a 9,999 room Mansion (?) Compound (?) Estate (?) Chateau (?) for 600+ years. There is also no way to renovate the place after a hundred years of disrepair. After all this is said, there is no other place like it in the world, so GO! For heaven sake, some of the trees in the Emperor's private garden are over 600 years old. You need a morning or an afternoon."
"An absolute ""Must See"" venue!
You can´t have been in Beijing without having seen the ""Forbidden City""!"
"Well, basically if you're in Beijing, all the history that each site has it's measured in thousands of years. This one is no exception. A must do in your to do list while in Beijing and like all others, listen to the tour guide explain the history and take pictures."
"It was a part of our visit in the forbidden city. We arrived at about9:30 am. It was so crowded. The security check was slow and the amount of visitors very high.
the tickets offices were fast. Do not forget an I. D. A passport or a driving license will work.
The buildings are amaizing however you cannot enter inside. All the items are behind windows. So after we took some photos we just left.
a visit is a must while staying in Beijing but it is overestimated."
"I've been here a couple of times and I honestly never get sick of it.

Tips: bring your passport to buy tickets.
Order tickets online ahead of time if possible.
Bring walking shoes.
Come on a weekday in the early morning.
Be prepared to shove. There are over 80,000 visitors/ day
Bring your own snacks and water.
Be prepared to stay 3-4 hours.

The palace is so gorgeous and full of history. If you want a feel for china, it's this and the Great Wall. Everything else is gravy."
"The palace museum known to the outside world as the Forbidden City, however the Chinese do not know it by this name even if you translate it to mandarin. They know it as "" Gu Gong"". So if you're taking a cab there, you have to tell them driver ""Gu Gong"".

This place is really huge and very impressive. However you can't enter into the buildings, but can look into it. The place does attract a lot of tourist, but because of it's sheer vastness, it does not feel that crowded. One of the must-visits in Beijing.

The palace museum shop does sell some interesting souviners, I especially like the fridge magnets in the various shapes and designs of the emperor, empress, princes and princesses. You can also get these cute designs on a kids t shirt too."
"you can see the history of old traditions and ways of life.
Personally found it interesting and totally different way of life from the west."
"you won't go to Paris and not see the Eiffel Tower, or to Rome and skip the Colosseum, so in Beijing you can't miss the Imperial palace.

however, this historical landmark is hugely important for chinese to visit, so expect hordes of tourists.

I have been to the Palace Museum several times, here some tips based on personal experience:
- go as early in the day as you can.
- avoid weekends and national festivities
- stay off the middle line, that is where everybody walks, try to stay on the sides, less people and a nice overview of the whole palace.
- in the coffee shop (just right before the living quarters) there is a small, but quiet hall, where you can sit away from the crowds.
- in the living quarters, to avoid tourgroups, keep walking till you get to the last one. Chances are bigger there are less people."
"The Palace Museum in the Forbidden City is a world unto itself, one of the truly amazing, overwhelming tourist venues in the world. Its vastness and beauty must be experienced to be believed, and it is in the heart of Beijing! Your number one stop in the city, whenever you visit."
Museum is huge. After a while all buildings look the same. Our tour guide made a visit much more interesting with additional information. Don't forget to bring your passport. Security is tight. Better to book tour trough agency as visit typically needs to be booked ahead of time.
"Really, really wonderfull to dwell around the palaces and learn about its history (take a guidebook and/or the audiotour with you). Imagine life in the palaces for all the different people on its good and bad days!"
"First and foremost, be ready for the huge crowd. And I really means loads and loads of people visiting the place.

There are tickets touts around, and if you are not visiting with a local, do not attempt to get tickets from them. It is illegal as there are plain clothes policeman waiting to catch them in action.

More about the place. Remember to wear good walking shoes. The pavement is uneven and the place is huge. Sunblock, umbrella, caps, shades during summer months, definitely a necessity as there are lots or outdoor walking.

The museum is not well maintained, but given the that it is so old and huge, with loads of tourists all year round, I think it is reasonable.

Nice place to know a little bit more about China history, but if you are travelling with young children, ensure to keep an eye on them. Getting lost in the crowd is a real possibility.

Take note that they offer translation headsets for a price, but most of the buildings have their history written in English. So you are not missing out too much."
The negative here is the quantity of people visiting..try to stand in the middle of any of the openings and image being by yourself..now start feeling like the emperor...
"Before you go here, you should read up on history or watch some documentary / movie to get a better idea of this place. The grounds are very large and there is a lot to see here. For one, you should visit here with a Tour Guide (Catherine Lu is really good) as they usually can give you a nice round up of the place and will help you relate to the history as they show you around.
The place gets very crowded as there are hoards of locals who also come to visit this place.
All in all, I would say that you've got to visit this place if you visit Beijing. Also, once you are done here, goto Jingshan Park to get a good view from the summit."
"I went there for twice, 2010 and 2015. This is a MUST go area in Beijing, The ancient palace acoss from Dynasty Ming to Dynasty Qing. The essence of China and historical. I went there with my father during the early Spring season, walked along the way from Wu Gate to Xuanwu Gate. Unforgatable Trip in my life."
"Lovely and impressive place to see and walking around wih no hurry. Don't forget to go into the park just by the north exit to have a upper view (with a symbolic price). But bear in mind it will be very crowd, I think always... Enjoy!"
"It is the world's largest palace complex and covers 74 hectares. Surrounded by a 52-meter-wide moat and a 10-metre-high wall are more than 8,700 rooms! This is a must for all visitors to Beijing!"
"Beautiful palace, be prepared to walk for long time (not so many places to sit there).
At the entrance, when you buy the tickets you will be asked for your ID."
"There is no doubt that the Palace Museum must be visited, at least once. It is a testimony of the past, but no longer lively. Some ""refreshment"" would be worth."
"Who would think of ping to Beijing and not see Forbidden City?!?!? Give yourself at least 3 hrs. Crowds are big in summer as many Chinese like to go as well. The place is expansive, beautiful, too many museums in there for you to see, so plan to spend a day there. Then if not, 3 hrs and the rest of the time at the stores surrounding Tiananmen Sq. There is a Starbucks at the opposite end of Tiananmen which is the best place to get an inexpensive healthy lunch and good coffe to tide you through the rest of the day."
"The Palace Museum - or commonly known as the Forbidden City, is one of the most impressive historical sites in the world. The vastness combined with symmetry, detail and architectural splendour is hard to rival. While navigating through the numerous halls and courtyards, it is easy to imagine the former times of this country with its deep history.

Impossible to take in, in one day - be selective on what you want to see. The northern area has the most variety including the antiquities museum, 9-dragon wall and noh theatre. The southern area contains the grand halls, with beautiful bronze lions guarding the gates.

The authorities have a done a great job on the curation and preservation of the complex - ensuring that it retains most of its historical authenticity, while being able to accommodate 80,000 tourists a day in the summer peak season."
"Don't tell people you've been to Beijing unless you've been to the Palace Museum. This is the must go place where you will discover history, relics, architectures and ancient philosophy. Do go early to avoid the crowd."
We arrived early to beat the queues but there were thousands of people around. The scale of the place is immense. The queues moved fairly well and we were soon inside the Forbidden City and start to learn the history of the site. It is difficult to comprehend such a large city within a city. Huge temples abound. Be prepared for many hours of walking if you want to explore all the 'city' has to offer.
"Acers of land with great architecture, imperial collections, beautiful landscaped gardens. You need alteast 4 to 5 hour to explore it completely. Visit only if you have interest in history and architecture."
"The name Forbidden City is still more appropriate for this attraction, as it is a huge complex of palaces within a huge area of Beijing. Be prepared to walk for hours and also to wait for a chaotic line up to buy tickets - unless you're part of a tour. Don't miss the gardens!"
"You wander through the first two courtyards and you've seen it all. As you can't get inside any of the buildings (except some exhibitions whose interior has nothing in common with the original anymore) or climb some of the walls the rest feels like seeing copy + paste.

Sure this place has a rich history, but the way it's presented doesn't get anything of it across.

If you have enough time to spend in Beijing it's fair enough, however if not so, go for the summer palace first and see the forbidden city from above from Jingshan Garden. The sheer size of the place is way more impressive from there.

Tip: If available don't forget your student's ID. Also foreign ones will save you half the entrance fee."
"Not much to see of consequence in this vast museum. If you want to see the real riches of the PRC, you must to Taiwan."
"We visited by ourselves without a tour guide. Its pretty straight forward, you can easily get the bassic idea just by reading the signs. Of course we missed a lot of details but its doable. Veryyy crowded and you will walk a lot!"
"The forbidden city is really wonderful in the world. the buildings are very amazing, everyday many people come here to visit."
Please employ a guide if you don't you will miss many of the details of this site. Guides are cheap and they really add to the tour.
"The Forbidden City is absolutely incredible. It came as a close second to Great Wall Mutianyu for our group. You definitely should wear sneakers because it's quite the walk through the palace grounds, but it is so worth every step. Amazing place!"
"You must be warned that there are LOTS OF people in the Forbidden City, especially from July to August. It's China's summer holiday. It's extremely crowded and noisy. I would suggest that enter into the Forbidden City from Northern Gate and leave from Southern Gate. There are many small halls in this place but each one is quite different based on it's function. It's says that there are 999 rooms there, but you never know as only part of the Museum is opened to public."
"Get this one done first on your Beijing trip as the opening hours are relatively short and the popularity of the site can cause difficulties. The Great Wall is definitely the other ""must do"" and can be done in as little as 4 hours from the outskirts of Beijing. I have missed out on the Palace on more than one visit due to closures.
The Palace is staggering, the history and the idea of life behind these walls is fascinating. Who could manage over a thousand concubines??"
"We actually visited here in 2008 but that year isn't available on the choice of dates. I could have spent much more time here but we were on a tour and limited to just a few hours. This place is gigantic and with 9,999 rooms, you really need much more time to peek in the windows and see everything. Very crowded time when we were there in May and lots of school groups as well. Would love to go back on our own to spend more time to enjoy it."
"This place you have to see. The place is full of the old Chinese fashions for the royal family. You can see original crowns and clothing of the Kings, The detail in the silk garments are amazing. there are examples of the plates bowls and jewelry from every dynasty. Please visit if your in Beijing, you will not regret it if you do."
"My husband and I had 6 days in Beijing and this was on our must see list and we weren't disappointed. Our hotel helped us book tickets on line. This is new but the web site is in Chinese and I think can only be booked with a Chinese credit card. It helped enormously as there is now a limit to the number of persons who can visit per day and the lines can be very long.

We had read quite a lot about the city and elected not to hire a guide partly because we were hassled so much in the street by guides and were put off. We showed our online ticket and received a swipe one ( the security staff directed us to the right window we would never have found it) and the queued up again to go through security. I hired an audio guide... Ok only 40 yuan

We took our time admiring the architecture and paid the extra 10 yuan to see the treasury which was well worth it. We spent 4 hours there, yes it was crowded, yes it was slightly repetitious at times and yes it is amazing despite the above, though in the treasury part you can go into the buildings and get more of an idea about the grandeur."
"Years ago I toured the interior royal room which were spectacular. Today you see these same room through scratched cloudy glass which creates an impersonal feel to the forbidden city. It is now just a collection of a 100 buildings with similar architecture surrounded by concrete walkways. The rock garden in the north of the city was the most pleasant part of the tour. There are some small museums set up in the outer buildings which were beautiful and fun, if can find them. You can not skip this number 2 attraction of Beijing, but be prepared that it is a 3 hour somewhat boring walk. Entrance fee is 60 yuan summer. Skip the audio player because it just reads the sign posted on each building, it does not contain much history."
"The place is always crowded and usually hot, so come with the right frame of mind/ it's worth it. As you go through the main gates, bear off to the left corner to buy your entrance tickets as many former reviews have stated. As you walk to the ticket booth you will be approached by many private tour operators. I personally use these people instead of the headphone alternatives. Many of these private operators are very good. I have had college professors trying to Mske a little extra cash and professional tour operators who had down time off to make some extra money. Just a quick few questions and you can tell if you have a good guide / a few more questions and you'll find out that it's not very expensive (you'll probably give a bigger tip than what the person asks for a fare.) then forbidden city itself cannot be missed - it is a must see! So much tradition and history that could have been lost forever. Take advantage of the rarity. Also , at the very end of the your, just as you are about to leave the north gate, look to the right and go thru the old red doors, they lead yo the most unique museum gift shop ever. It's almost impossible to find. But is the place you want to go if you want original signed Colography art from the cousin of the last emperor, this is a great place to find it and other very unique original pieces."
"Obviously, it is a must visit in China. Nevertheless, it gets really crowded, the audioguides don't work well at all (they don't finish the explanations, they change languages on their own, they don't provide a good audio, the information they give is poor and not very interesting and the guys that speak in your language are Chinese people with a terrible accent that is barely understandable). We got bored after seeing that the Forbidden City was all the same but getting bigger and bigger every time. You can visit the courtyards but not enter the buildings (you can just see the inside from the door and you almost see nothing because there are no lights in there) except those which have a kind of museum inside. The expositions displayed are not very well presented. It is interesting to go up to the hill of the Jinsheng park in order to cope with the dimensions of the Forbidden City. That is breathtaking."
"We went to the Forbidden City the day before the national holiday (October 1) in 2014. It was crowded, but after a terrible experience trying to get to the Great Wall it wasn't so bad by comparison.
FYI, the interior of the Palace Museum is closed on Mondays. We were unable to go inside, but the grounds are huge, so we were still able to spend several hours walking the grounds and seeing all kinds of beautiful architecture and landscaping.
My fiance and I did not have a tour group. We just took a train to Tian'anmen West Station and walked to the lineup. It took a while for us to get through security, but I found that they tend to let Westerners through the security checks without much hassle. They were taking water bottles away from other visitors, but didn't take them from us.
My advice is to just wander and enjoy whatever you see! There were many temples to the east of the palace museum, and we saw several brides getting their engagement photos taken around the buildings. We learned later that it's common for a bride and groom to have hundreds of bridal portraits taken before the wedding so that they have big albums of photos to show their friends and family. It's a very extravagant affair so it was really cool to see them in their different costumes (the photographers provide costumes for them...they don't usually wear their actual wedding clothes for these pictures).
As with any Chinese tourist attraction, expect to be charged for a ticket to various areas of the grounds. The tickets never amount to much money, so you may as well just get them."
"I should explain that title... We travel w 3 young kids aged 3,6&7 and being in a hot and crowded place on the first day in a new city was not the smartest holiday plan!!!

Our guide had an unfortunate incident and cancelled that morning and when we reached the palace all guides had been taken so we ended up renting these automatic guides. Not very good.

It took us about an hour to buy the tickets - tip 1 buy tickets online
The cobbled courtyard was not very stroller friendly but we managed by sticking to the sides - tip 2 carry toddlers or get a very sturdy stroller 😉

When you walk into the first courtyard it's like walking into a movie set such as The Last Emperor. We were almost expecting soldiers to come running in...

Despite the crowd, the sheer size of the place means that u r stil able to get away n immerse yourself into the historical atmosphere.... Until my child's shrill brought me back to reality 😜

Around the Palace are some quaint streets w little shops and local eateries ... Ideal after the long walk in the Palace...."
"The Palace Museum also known as The Forbidden City is a MUST place to visit in Beijing. Be prepared to walk a LOT. This place is expansive. Its a vast complex of buildings, courtyards with many different directions to wander off and explore. It does get very crowded, lots of tourist. Ticket entrance fee is 60 Yuan, and make sure to bring your passport. Try to get there early, the line for ticketing gets very long. That will also give you more time to look around and not so rush. Make sure to bring bottle water, snacks. Take your time and pay attention to the details. The scale and grandeur of this place can be overwhelming, as well as the massive crowds."
"Amazing to see the attention to detail surrounding the Summer Palace, we went when they had summer holidays and yes it was very crowded, but the whole experience was worth it."
"Check the operation schedule before you depart as their operation time will adjust according to season. Avoid their public holidays else it will be congested by people and no fun at all. In Beijing, the sunrise start at 4 am in summer time. Get up early and go early. Entrance is at south gate. Take MRT to tiananmen. Get a tour set if you are solo traveler. Do not rush, inspiring their historical background back in 400-500 years ago ! After the palace museum, you may walk to opposite to jingshan park. From the hill, you may get an overview scene of the palace. Awesome !"
"Toured on a very busy and hot weekend day. Our guide said they limit the number of tourists to 80,000 per day. Spectacular buildings and significantly larger than I expected. Book a tour that starts on one end and picks you up on the other or you'll have a serious hike back to the start. Well worth paying for an English speaking guide to explain the culture and history of the Chinese empire."
"Take yourself back to 1420. Henry V sits on the English throne but in China the Ming Emperor is completing his magnificent Forbidden City, which will be occupied by the next 24 Emperors of the Ming & Qing dynastys. The last, Pu Yi, became Emperor at the age of just 2 only to see revolution change China for ever just 3 years later. Thankfully the Forbidden city was preserved and is now considered one of the worlds 5 most important palaces. Whilst very busy, visitor numbers are limited and there are areas where you can find an uncrowned spot to admire the magnificent and well preserved buildings, with their beautiful colours and decoration. As you pass through various doorways you will find that you have to step over a small step, which was apparently to keep the ghosts out! Don't forget to look up at the rooflines too, some of which have lines of carved dragons, the symbol of the Emperors power. There are numerous items of furniture etc on display and also a beautiful garden to the rear. It is definitely one of the highlights of any visit to Beijing and all the more interesting if you know a bit of its history beforehand."
This place is huge and crowded. Get a map or guide or you will probably get lost. Much of the inside looks the same and one can easily get turned around with all the passages available to visit. There are several museums on site even though the whole place is a museum now. Some of them charge extra fees to enter though. Plan to spend at least several hours if not most of the day here to truly see the place. Be warned that patience will be required if you want pictures without heads in them and there is shoving involved as seems to be the norm in most of China now.
"The Forbidden City is so massive, don't expect you would be able to finish touring the entire museum. But try not to go on a weekend because it gets crazy crowded.

For a first-timer in Beijing, the palaces are very beautiful and exciting because I'd only seen these in pictures and not in real life. The courtyards are so huge, it takes a while to get to one palace from another. And in between, there are steps and there are many good picture spots.

What I really liked was the museum that housed watches that were made for the emperor back then. There were also a lot of clocks given to the Qing emperors by Swissmen, Englishmen and etc.

If you want some good souvenirs, you can also buy some legit paintings made on silk, and don't worry, they aren't fakes because souvenir shops in these landmarks are government-regulated.

Also, make sure you bring your passport because sometimes they check them. Also see if you can get away with a student priced ticket if you have an international student card.

Also, for first-timers in China, don't be surprised if tourists cut you in the line and keep pushing everyone when lining up for the toilets--it's standard Chinese (uncivilized) behaviour (not saying everyone is though!) Just make sure you keep your spot and don't be afraid to tell people off if they're pushing you too much."
Visited during a business trip. Huge amount of history and a lot to see as to how the Chinese lived their lives. Well worth a visit.
The Forbidden City [known as the palace museum] was excellent. Amazing structures. Must see. Hire guide or go with tour.
"I have been to the Forbidden City twice now, and must say that it is a very impressive structure. There are not many words that I can use the describe the magnificence of the palace, but I can speak on the crowds. MAKE SURE YOU GO ON AN UNPOPULAR DAY, because in all of my travels of the world, this is by far the MOST CROWDED ATTRACTION I HAVE EVER BEEN TO. It is definitely worth it, even if you can only make it on a day when there will be many people and tours, you should still go, but you will have an exponentially better time If you go during the week."
Another very interesting place that gives you a good idea of how the elite lived in the days of the dynasties. The workmanship is very well done.
"So many others have commented on how unique and impressive this is, so I would just note a visit in August guarantees very large crowds and very sweaty waits. Oh, and buy your ticket in advance online vs standing for > 1 hour because the tickets have your passport number on them. They say it's to limit visitors to 80k a day, which given the crowds I completely believe. I'd like to come back in, say, February :)"
"Amazing Museum! Very expensive ticket but worth it. The Museum is huge. I recommend taking the entire day to see it. Also, there are many people so you must come on a weekday.
This is the best place to get to know ancient Chinese culture/ architecture. However, if you have already very familiar with ancient Chinese culture/ architecture, the museum may be a little boring. Definitely be prepared to do a lot of walking and to be outside. Also, you must present ID to buy tickets so bring everyone's passports. Also, bring a lot of water and food for everything is very expensive in the museum."
"though the service quality is relatively low, people flooded in and out, it is still the best place to go if you love chinese history and antiques.

save your time on buying souvenirs there, the quality of souvenirs are not good."
This place is a little disappointing considering the great amount of history here. Especially having to deal with the mobs of people just to get here. I think it's a must-see because of it's fame but I won't be ever going back!
"Very enlightening visit, the commentary helped a lot too. Beautiful grounds and it was a pleasure to walk around it freely."
"Not only did we have a fun time looking at the summer palace, but we enjoyed looking at the artifacts in english. The best part was not the summer palace, but the fact that some Chinese people would dress up in authentic clothing and ask to take pictures with us (americans). It was funny and enjoyable to feel famous for a bit."
"Home to 24 emperors, and the heart of China for 500 years, the Forbidden City is simply breathtaking. Huge, detailed, exquisite craftsmanship...and all designed to be seen by the emperor and his entourage alone. There are 800 buildings and 9000 rooms, together with courtyards, pavilions and gardens. Understandably much is closed to the public, but the sections which are open go on for ever and will keep you enthralled for hours. Only downside is the crowds - up to 40,000 per day. Get there early to avoid the worst of it!"
"The Forbidden City was high on my list of 'must see' places in Asia so I was excited to be able to visit on a brief trip to Beijing. The Forbidden City itself I think is amazing but it was just impossible to really take it in or enjoy it with the hoard of other tourists there (I realise that I was one of that hoard to other people there!). We went early and midweek but it was still so crowded and there was no concept of 'personal space' from a lot of the tourists there, who were often happy to barge straight though anyone in their way. Not an experience I enjoyed unfortunately."
An amazing collection of history and culture! Expect large crowds and miles of walking -- and you can't see it all in one visit. Take the optional side tour of the 9 Dragon Wall and see more of the palace jewels; it's worth the few extra RMB.
"Incredible, but there are so many People that it is difficult to enjoy the visit. It must be visited with a good guide. That is important to learn and enjoy even more the visit."
"I was very glad to see Forbidden City not just reading about the story.This Palace is huge, spend couple hours to see and enjoy the magnificent architectures.
The crowds is crazy and I suggest morning time is good for visiting the palace or during the week day.
There are steps and long walk to get to the end.Please prepare your comfortable shoes before you go."
"There are many gate to enter inner palace area ; Superb crowded with local and foreign people. The main hall building are impressive; The Chinese dragon style carving on each column & pole & rooftop. Famous stone carving stairway ; the Chinese half crescent moon bridge. Twin lion or Pixiu figure places front of each gate to prevent evil spiritual came in.

There are some ice cream/soft drink &souvenir shop service before exit but a bit pricy. All in all these are such a lovely historical place if you ignored those bumpy crowded."
"Aside from the wall, of course forbidden city is a must see but there are herds of humans everywhere it's crazy! I'm not when is the off season but yes go then so you'll get the real feel."
"Touring the Forbidden City when visiting Beijing is a must, but don't spend more than half a day there. The size is immense and that alone is impressive - particularly when considering the time it was built."
"Must Visit when in Beijing.
The entrance fee was 60 yuan and audio guide 40 yuan. I did see signs stating that online booking of tickets was possible so I would recommend that since the ticket lines are quite crazy. Personally, I found the audio guide to be a great option as it has a GPS tracker whereby commentary flows as you enter different areas. Since this site gets extremely crowded, I found this to be much more helpful than if I had taken a tour as I saw a lot of people struggling to catch up or hear what was being said.

The whole Palace took me about 2-ish hours moving non-stop, on a very crowded day but I've known people to take upto 3-4 hours.

Another point to note is that when you exit the Museum on the Jinshan Park side, there are very few public transport options. The cabs charge a bomb (despite me bargaining in Mandarin) and the closest Subway station is a healthy 2 km walk away. It's advisable to ask around for bus routes to get to the closest station."
"This place can be as active as you would like! Lots of walking and stairs. Well worth the lines getting the ticket and inside. So many people everywhere. Be prepared to be in large crowds and walking a lot. The palaces are magnificent, the gardens are majestic and the views are phenomenal (with smog of course). I came here via public transit so it was relatively easy to get to (right across from Tianamen Square). Be sure to wear comfortable clothing and shoes (I wore tennis shoes). After leaving the vast palaces, the walk back to public transit is filled with little shops of knick-knacks that ar fun to look at. I highly recommend this place as a must when in Beijing."
"A nice place to see for yourself where the Emperors of China lived. The architecture was nice. You can get to try the royal-family-style clothes at an additional fee. However, the place was very crowded. It was very hot and sunny (I visited in September)."
"Add this to you visit to Tiananmen Sq. Didn't see a need for a guide. Everything self explanitorty. Be prepared walk heaps. Like IKEA in one way out another. Exit is quite a distance from entrance.
This is a very interesting place with lots of history."
"Another must-do on your Beijing list. It can be very busy. I think you should either go well prepared and know what it's about, or let the information just flow into you via audio guide or sign boards. Personally, what was impressive for me that it is really immense, but the buildings seem - for the untrained eye - just the same over and over again."
"I can only agree that the crowd in July was too much. Not only do you have to queue up for the ticket and the security and then again for an audio guide but you simply can not enjoy the place. Too many people.
Additionally my audio guide worked only half of the time and was hard to understand (it gets noisy with all the tourists). Too many of the buildings are closed and with the crowd it is difficult to even have a peak inside.
The area is huge and would need a lot of time. Anyone seen smoker-areas? Me not."
"I really do not understand the hype about the Forbidden City. Yes, it is large and yes it has a very fascinating history attached and yes one should see it if in Bejing but going to Beijing just to see this sight is not advised. All you see are a few buildings from the outside (you cannot enter any of the buildings) and a tiny part of the garden (which is lovely). Mind you the buildings are very similar (and present the typical chinese architecture with wonderful roof features). And the crowds in the summer at least (we went in July) were unbearable. You're essentially pushed through the site. The entire experience is once again very touristy as all sightseeing in china. I was very disappointed."
"It was really interesting and thankfully we had a tour guide to explain things to us. The only reason I gave it this rating is because there´s too many people, I could barely walk. And many information signs were only in Mandarin, which means they were not realy ready for tourists. Aside from this, it has beautiful architecture and history."
"Just like everyone else, I was mesmerized by the palace. I took the time to read the history of the palace prior to visiting and the time really paid off in understanding. Architecturally it is magnificent and it takes time just to take it all in. You can make history come alive with very little imagination. You have to see this site if you are inl Beijing."
"The Forbidden City is beautiful and tells the story of China's great dynasties. The security has changed. You must queue before entering. This is VERY important, bring your passport. You can't purchase a ticket without it. We were very lucky our hotel let us know. We might have spent all that time and could have been turned away."
"My son and I visited the Forbidden City by taking the subway to Tiananmen East and getting out at exit #C. The entry fee was 60 yuan, and we had to queue to purchase tickets which took a very long time. Although the ticket lines did not seem very long, persons were continually giving ID's to other persons in the line to buy tickets on their behalf, and other persons were walking up the exit lane to buy tickets to avoid the queue. I would advise to purchase tickets online if you are visiting this attraction.

There were so many visitors, that we decided to walk straight through from the South to North Gate, to minimise the time spent here. We had previously visited the Xiyue Temple, Shenyang Palace and the Puppet Imperial Palace and were impressed by these attractions. The size of the forbidden city and it's architecture is impressive, but I found it much more pleasant viewing the architecture of the Xiyue Temple and Shenyang palace, where you could move at a slow pace without crowds. The exhibits at the Shenyang palace were much better and more interactive, and the architecture was similar.

In our opinion the palace garden was the best part of the tour, as there were few people here and we could stroll through the garden and view the surrounding buildings. The gift shops in the forbidden city were well stocked, but were probably the most expensive that we had seen on our visit. If we had to make the decision again, we probably would not have visited, having seen the other sites mentioned above."
"The Forbidden City is opposite Tiananmen Square - yin/yang and you go through a Security check when you go from the one to the other. You do not cross the road although there are security points where you can cross the road - you go downstairs through the underground. It is wide and safe and clean.
The Forbidden city is probably if not bigger than Tiananmen Square with many local and international visitors. There are no shade or Gardens only big squares with big buildings. Only the Emperor the Empress and the concubines lived in the Forbidden City. Every building had a purpose like a building for the residing doctor but he had to leave at a certain time of the day. Building where all the jewels satins and jade were stored. The Forbidden city is one big place and my suggestion is to go with a local tour guide so you can hear the history but there is so much to see that you could probably go back the next day to investigate more. Although there is no garden inside the Forbidden City the garden is at the back. It is one beautiful garden with old trees and rocks and buildings a surprise to see after the buildings and stone in the beginning."
Excellent despite the crowds. I've been here a few times and have found that a guide helps to understand the significance of things you'd miss with just a book.
"This is a great experience, the place is massive and as you walk through it it just seems to keep going and going. One of our fav experiences in China"
"The Forbidden City (also called the Palace Museum) is one of the top two sights in Beijing. Expect crowds, and avoid weekends when it is most crowded. I visited before the daily limit on the number of visitors was put in place. There were long, but fast moving, queues for tickets.

You must enter from the southern end: Tian'anmen (Gate of Heavenly peace), buy tickets and then enter the restricted part of the palace from Wumen (Meridian gate). You can exit only from the northern end: Shenwumen (Gate of Divine Might). It is a long walk to a metro station from here, and taxis are not easy to get, so make sure you know which bus to take from the exit.

We spent a full day here; not much when you consider that some emperors spent their whole lives inside. There is a limited variety of food available inside the palace, pick up a tourist map when you buy your ticket so that you know where these are. There are also multiple souvenir shops with which seemed to give the best value for jade artifacts which I've seen. Walking along the central axis takes you to the main throne halls, palace, and the Imperial gardens (in that order).

You may want to explore the sides. Immediately after Wumen on the left and right are the Halls of Military Eminence and Literary Glory, which house collections of paintings, calligraphy, jade and porcelain, which are worth looking at. Straight through is the Tiahemen (Gate of Supreme Harmony) and the main throne halls. After that on the right are the Nine Dragon Screen and the quarters of the Qianlong Emperor and the Empress Cixi.

The maximum crowds are near Tianhe Dian (Hall of Supreme Harmony) which contains the remains of the Dragon Throne. I have to go back once to see this, because I was jostled more than I've been on the Mumbai local trains while trying to take a look."
"There are a couple of things to be aware of when planning to visit this place.
First, since June 2015 the Palace Museum (aka ""Forbidden City"") limited the number of visitors to 80.000. You can buy a ticket on-line, however the website is in Chinese only (Good luck! and by the way, Google Translate does not work in China)

Then, be aware of ""local guides"" who offer their services.

Last, but not least, you can only enter from Tiananmen Square and once you passed the Meridian Gate (where they check your tickets) you can only get out through the other side (it's like a one-way street)

A lot of tourists stay on the central part only, but keep in mind that there are a lot of small buildings and souvenir shops on the sides as well."
"Very important to be with a tour for this huge complex (I'm sure I'd still be lost) to get a better understanding of the many buildings, courtyards, and gardens. a must do excursion!"
"must see in the middle of the city, be early at least at weekends, since the ticket line is huge - millions of guests; the inner exhibitions require additional tickets"
"Our visit cannot be described other than a disappointment.
You appreciate the size and the history but on a hot Wednesday in July you just felt lost in the massive crowd.
Icy water on sale was appreciated.
Buildings however were closed to the public. Some places allowed a rare glance through windows.
Just appreciate that it is the largest palace and that no access had been allowed for 500 years."
"So many of the things that we had learned about the Chinese became ""part of the day."" They were very friendly and when we were able to visit the rows and rows of chinese warriors they talked to us and explained things that we would never have known. It was fantastic and also truly a learning experience."
"I don't like it.,it's too much walking with not so much thing to see..it's not worth the money and waste time..go to summer palace much better"
"Second time around and I was still disappointed with this attraction. Maybe because of the large crowds or the lack of organization when buying tickets. It was our first day in Beijing; I forgot to bring enough cash so I asked an employee which window allows me to purchase with a credit card. She directed us to the tour guides line but when we got to the window, saleslady yelled and told us only tour guides in Mandarin...Okay...we went back to employee, she said it's okay, you can buy it there. But saleslady was too scary to risk going back and getting yelled at. So we went to another line that displayed the Union card logo. When we got to the front, saleslady asked manager and I guess they didn't want to use their credit card machine so he told me there's an ATM machine at the far left side, all the way to the left of the ticket windows. So we went and got cash. Third time's the charm-we purchased our tickets successfully."
The amount of history overload one has after visiting this place is just astounding. There is just too much to see and take in and it can almost overwhelm you. But overall a pretty spectacular experience. A must visit...
"Worth visiting. Ticket office wasn't very well sign-posted and nobody seemed to speak English. I had applied (and been accepted) on The Palace Museum website for a free small group tour with an English speaking guide, when we got to the Museum nobody knew anything about the tour! We used one of their audio guide which was very good to begin with, but after a while would keep returning to the start and not the room we were in. The space and buildings were terrific but very empty!! We didn't go to the ceramics room, but the treasure room only had a few display cases in them - I expected 'props/costumes'. It would have been great to get a real glimpse into what the rooms looked like at the time of use.We went at 2:30 pm when it was a little quieter, tickets weren't too expensive. Watch out for taxi drivers wanting to rip you off!!!! YOU NEED TO SHOW PASSPORTS."
"It is a ""must see"" place in Beijing. Full of history! Try not to go during weekends, it is more crowded. Do not, under any circumstance, take those tuc tuc or passsenger motobike. They want to cheat you"
This is easy to access in town and worth the visit. It is a fascinating historical overview of a complex Chinese society. I really learned a lot of background to help me understand the Chinese culture better. And it is an easy attraction to see on a business trip as opposed to others that took too much time to get to.
"It's important to plan in advance to visit this site because the Chinese government has set limits on the number of tickets that it will sell. In the summer Chinese tourists from other cities flock to Beijing, so the government sets the limits to protect this World Heritage site. The website for The Palace Museum directs visitors to reserve tickets online, but unfortunately, that portion of the site is only in Mandarin. Most foreign tourists will need to have a hotel concierge or tour guide reserve tickets -- a process that also requires your passports. There may be a limited number of tickets available on a walk-up basis, but again, you'll need to bring your passport.

Set aside 2-3 hours to see this attraction (formerly known as the Imperial Palace), wear good walking shoes, and carry bottled water with you in the summer time.

Entry is through the southern gate, and you can exit either through the northern or eastern gate. If you exit the eastern gate, you'll find yourself on a street lined with good, inexpensive restaurants...perfect if you've toured the site in the morning and need a lunch with substance."
"One could not possibly go to China and not visit. It is one of the first questions you are asked when you return. We were fortunate to be on a tour, so very glad to not be in the long entrance queues. I don't think we could have got as much out of this tour without our wonderful tour guide. Like other reviews noted, it's big, it's uneven, it's crowded, it has little to no shade - but it's worth it."
"What an amazing complex of buildings. And the walls and gates. Everything about the Palace Museum is spectacular. Go, take your time, don't forget the camera, ignore the crowds and the noise. And don't miss the gardens."
"Top 5 things I wish I knew before going to the Palace Museum:

1. Be prepared to wait in the sun in a looooong queue. So bring your umbrella and lots of water. If possible, book tour tickets online and collect them at a much shorter line closer to the entrance.
2. Bring your IDs. You are required to present a government issue ID when purchasing tickets (passports for foreigners and national cards for locals). Make sure you make full use of your students cards since it does give you a discount by a huge margin!
3. Walk. Walk. Walk. To avoid future regrets and ruining the rest of your trip, bring your most comfortable shoes. You WILL be walking. ALOT.
4. Make sure your take your time. Try not rush through the entire place and the view does gets better as you go deeper into the palace. Also, don't just look around and at the ground. LOOK UP. The sky line is amazing and the details on the pillars are amazing.
5. Do not expect to exit where you entered. The human traffic has been designed to be one way so there is not way you are getting out where you got in, the guards will direct you in the opposite direction and make you rewalk all the way back. Therefore, just follow the signs and the crowd to get out."
Caution: The forbidden palace is huge and will require a long walk. Wear comfy shoes with good traction because the stones are very slippery when wet.
"First of all, watch for the scams. (1) If you are over 60 or impaired, you are entitled to a half-price ticket on production of passport or government ID. Ticket vendors like to charge foreigners the full price, issue a discount ticket, and pocket an easy 30RMB. (2) The taxis and three-wheelers at the exit are motorized thieves. There is no requirement for them to know where anything is, regardless of whether you have a name and directions written in Chinese characters (note: they're all literate). You are quite likely to be dropped somewhere unfamiliar and distant from your destination, and then presented with a card that demands more money - in some cases, ridiculous amounts, like 300 RMB. Best plan is to use the metro or alternatively, arrange for your hotel to send a taxi to pick you up.
The audio guides are not very good quality and my companion felt they actually interfered with her enjoyment of the palace. The signposting is adequate, but the routing is not clearly laid out. You cannot see many interiors, certainly not with any comfort, due to the crowds and noise."
"Came here by myself in July 2015. As other reviews have stated, the Palace Museum (also known as the Forbidden City) is majestic. Its scale is almost incomprehensible -- how did one family (I use the term loosely) manage to occupy so much space? A definite must-visit when in China.

Some tips for your visit:
- come early, around noon. They are limiting the number of visitors to 30,000 (I think) per day, to preserve the site.
- prepare to line up for tickets in the sun. I lined up for 45 minutes.
- bring an umbrella because it's going to get sunny, and there is no shade."
"Extremely big, so many Chinese tourists. Try to get there early to avoid the crowd and get good walking shoes. And go to the top of the park at the north to et an nice view of the Palace and Beijing. Expat living in Beijing"
The Palace Museum is better known as the Forbidden City. Plan on spending at least 3 hours as it is quite large. It becomes crowded during the day so you should be there when it opens or shortly after. Across from Tiananmen Square there is a great view from the top of the Entrance which has steps just to the left when you enter. For best information you can rent a tape and ear phones that tell you what you are seeing step by step. Several languages are available.
You need good sport shoe when you go this place. But you will never regret it. Its give you different perspective on how past China Emperor live like.
There are so many people even I travel in the weekdays. Do expect to spend an hour for the ticket. Bring along your umbrella not just for the rain but for the sunshine in summer time because it is so hot in Beijing. It is a big palace and I think I will travel alone for at least one day to see evertything again. It is so beautiful!
"China opened the doors to the public when it comes to places like The Palace, as we all know was closed to the public in the past. Make sure you have lots of time so you can go around the Palace. Coming early enough will give you lots of time we didn't have. Unfortunately in the Palace you're not allowed to use you camera, obvious reasons.
I have managed to still few pictures of the guards training, but was soon approached (in politely Chinese way) by the security and asked to switch of the camera.
Do not forget to carry a bag full of water coz it is very hot walking around."
"With 1,000 or so buildings and courtyards set in approximately 180 acres, this is an enormous complex, but its size isn’t immediately obvious. There’s no vantage point where you can see the entire city. Instead, it opens up like a nesting doll – pass through one courtyard and building to find another beyond, and another and another.

The city was built in the early 1400s as a showpiece to reflect the wealth and power of Emperor Yongle (also responsible for the Temple of Heaven), and was home to 24 Ming and Qing emperors before China became a republic in 1917. Many of the original buildings fell victim over the years to fire – both accidental and arson – and have been rebuilt.

The rooms used for ceremonies or occupied by the emperor would have been sumptuous in their day (much less so for the myriad concubines, whose modest quarters are tucked quite far back). You can see inside some rooms, but you can’t enter any, and on our tour we saw nothing on display by way of clothing, art, calligraphy, jade, ceramics, etc. I was glad I’d had the chance to see many such treasures from the Forbidden City when they went on show in Vancouver last year as part of a travelling exhibition. The Forbidden City is now also known as the Palace Museum, so I’m sure that if you’re visiting on your own and have a bit of time, you’ll find some building displaying artifacts.

The imperial gardens at the far end of the complex are peaceful and somewhat less crowded. The original moat still surrounds the Forbidden City and the city gates still exist, but the ancient city wall was torn down in the 1950s to make way for a ring road, one of six that encircle modern Beijing."
"The scale and grandeur of this site can be overwhelmed by the massive crowds streaming through.

I arrived at 10:30 on a Tuesday morning (having gotten lost on the way there) and then spent almost two hours in the blazing heat trying to get inside. The ticket line alone took over an hour! By noon the site was completely overrun. All my pictures are littered with other people.

My advice if you're traveling during the Chinese school holiday: show up really early, preferably with ticket in hand, and then escape before the summer sun starts testing your endurance. I just wish I had another day to try it!

Alternately, see the Lama City or Temple of Heaven instead. They're hardly interchangeable but similar enough if you're unfamiliar with ancient China."
Great history to walk through and you can imagine how life was in the old days. Make sure youo have read the history befor you arrive or view the Last Emperor movie. Best what I can recommend is to spend some money and and time and go with a qualified guide. you will then see the hidden corners of the forbidden city !
"My mate and i just recently went to the forbidden city and was a approached by female tour guide to take us through. My mate and i thought it was a good idea, to get more inormation about the place,but found out the hard way it was a big mistake. She rushed us though, taked really fast and couldn't take the information in. Also didn't give us time to do any photography. never told us we couldn't walk backwards through the forbidden city to do photography after the tour. PLEASE everyone stay clear of a giude called Marsha she is bad news!!!!"
"I visited the Forbidden city on a Saturday in May at the end of a bust business trip and it was hot hot hot. It takes a couple of hours to make your way through and explore so just as well there are little shops in there and a cafe where you can get water, ice creams etc along the way. It was lovely. If you are traveling alone I recommend hiring an audio tour kit, it consists of headphones and a tablet that tracks your location as you wander through and will give you the history of the area or palace you are standing in. As you go from palace to palace and see the thrones and sleeping quarters for the concubines you get transported back in time, as it has been preserved so well. Bring a camera as you will take tons of pics. The palace garden at the very back of the palace is lovely and if you have some time take a moment to sit and breathe in all the tranquility before you go back to hustle and bustle of Beijing. It was once in a lifetime for me and I loved it."
If you do not see this and are lazy not to photograph this museum where allowed you are likely to confuse it with similar structures that abound Beijing
"A truly incredible place
Far bigger than I had imagined (and i had high hopes)
I must have taken hundreds of photos because there is so much to see, and the place is very photo friendly, almost every angle is incredible

I was there after peak season, and it was crowded even then - be careful not to loose who you are with as its very hard to find each other again
I went on a day with clear blue skies, it is possible in beijing, so do try and wait for a smog free day"
"The entire experience of the forbidden city is greatly ruined by the amount of scams/con artists/dangerous people in the surrounding area who are simply there to harass and rip off tourists.

Do not under ANY CIRCUMSTANCE get a tuk tuk anywhere near here. We couldn't find the entrance and so had to but greatly regretted it. We ended up in a particularly bad situation (the exact same thing happened to another traveler we met meaning it's an ongoing scam) which thankfully we got out do with only losing 20yuan and being shaken up a bit.

Do not under ANY CIRCUMSTANCE speak to anyone other than who you came with. This sounds bad but we were approached by multiple different people- men and women, young and old and all were varying types of scams. Do not believe anything you hear! Thankfully we didn't have any other problems in any other tourist attractions."
"Absolutely was amazed at the shear size of this place, stunning building with most of them having what they were used for on signage, would highly recommend a guide to see forbidden city as they can give you more detail.

This for me is the number 1 thing to do and see in Beijing, a must visit on any trip to China."
"This is an impressive museum, with beautiful grounds and structure - a must see for anyone visiting Beijing.

However, the most important treasues were taken to Taiwan by the Nationalist Party government. To see the best pieces, one has to visit Taipei."
"Another attraction in the heart of Beijing city. You can visit Tienanmen square with capital museum, forbidden city, war hero's monument in single place. This place is full of buildings created according to ancient Chinese architecture and you can walk in this large area for more than 3 hours if you really interested."
"We started in Tian Anmen Square then entered the Forbidden City through the ""Gate of Heavenly Peace"". This is not something we would have attempted on our own, it was very helpful to have our Viking tour guide, who also happens to be a Beijing native. He explained all the cultural significances and history, pointed out many interesting sites we would otherwise have missed. We took hundreds of pictures, beautiful ceilings and rooftops, a marble lined moat and marble bridges, huge brass urns... everything is just so scenic."
"I know this is one of those must see sights that the crowds might make you think nah. Forget about the crowds - go here! Thank god the Red Guard didn't get into the place.

Be sure to see the smaller buildings off to the sides of the central axis.

The gardens were the greatest surprise for me as I never saw a single photo of them.

Try to come on a weekday - not Monday it's closed then - to avoid the biggest crowds.

Watch out for the scams. I had a pretty young woman strike up a conversation with me. She wanted to ""practice her English"". When we got to where the ticket booths were - BRING YOUR PASSPORT! - she said ""too busy let's get some tea or coffee"". I had forgotten about this scam but really it didn't matter as I had only one goal to see the Forbidden City. When I was definitive about not wanting to wait to enter she left me."
The list of surprises and wonderments that are in this area are uncountable. The view of life of the average soldier and peasant to the inter court happenings are very well displayed here
"It's hard to begin to imagine the balance in every single item you'll see, from the tiers of marble stairs to the meandering mote. The detail in every inch under the roof is awe-inspiring. There are limited areas where you can view room interiors behind glass, but it's worth the look. We had a guided tour, but I don't know if there is a recorded tour available. If so, get it. Make sure you get to the center to see the throne. Easy to find -- that's where the densest crowd is! I believe they just reduced the daily traffic from 100,000 to 30,000, but you may need to get there VERY early or have a reservation.

Hint: Watch ""The Last Emporer"" - 1987 before you go, and you'll appreciate it even more. I believe this is the ONLY film that was ever made here."
"This was by far the most unforgettable UNESCO World Heritage Site that I have ever been to.

The five centuries of rich history of this massive palace complex will truly captivate you as soon as you enter the Meridian Gate (Wu Men).

The sheer grandeur of the series of buildings and structures were truly mesmerizing.

All of the palaces and halls exemplifies the best in Chinese architecture.

I suggest you dedicate an entire day here as every step and turn reveal yet another fascinating rooms, chambers, garden, etc...

I made a mistake of not reading about the history of the Forbidden City but will be prepared the next time I visit as I am certain it will help me appreciate more the fascinating stories behind every brick, tile, marble and log used to build each and every stunning structure in this expansive palace complex.

A truly fascinating and indescribable historical site.

Not visiting this place is like not seeing Beijing at all."
"The place is amazing, as you walk by you can imagine how the emperors lived here. The roofs of the buildings are the most beautiful part of the visit. Be prepared to be amazed."
"So packed of people and tour guides, but with a amazing architecture and view. It's a stunning place, great time there. It'll be really hard, I dare to say impossible to take a picture there without a single head, but still is worth it."
"Overall, we have not impressed that much with the forbidden city!
There are several buildings including the kings and queen palaces. The number of the buildings are too many so you may need at least 5 hours if you want to visit most of them. But anyway most of them looks almost the same!"
"Great place to visit, so big and well presented. Makes you wonder how one family could occupy such a large space. Well preserved"
"It's very big, very cowded, a lot of groups trying to see the same objective at ones, but also a lot of things to see. I spent half a day inside, but there were more to see. I give up because my legs were very tired and went back to the airport not to loose my flight back :)"
"The place Its so big, all mármol and still many closed areas, so Its bigger, unbelievable. So much history, Amazing the ancient Live in this Palace. And wait to see when soldiers stop tráfic at morning and aftenoo for the flags at Tianmen square, they are Like robots, so perfect walking at the same time. All palaces looks smaller when you visit the city. For many Old chinese people Its great visit for first time, because was not ALLOWED to get they were young."
"One of must see in Beijing...we had a fantastic time in the Palace Museum...lots to see..and lots of walking..the staff were very friendly and helpful when we asked for assistance, grounds nice and clean.."
"Goes without saying, see this place. Grab an ear piece at the door and spend 2hrs walking through. The ear piece has suggested paths based on how much time you have. You walk from southern gate to northern gate. Here is like a hunting ground from rickshaw drivers. I suggest you cross the road and go left then right, takes you to the lakes park and also via some chinese ""restaurants""."
"The name itself makes one wonder what is inside the city. I have been there many years ago and was awed wealth of China history it held from the Ming Dynasty all the way to the Qing Dynasty. These day the protocol for entering the grounds have become more complicated by security checks of bags and even IDs. We went without a guide and it was winter so it wasn't so crowded. You can read about the palace and its grounds beforehand in books or just google the history up. Then, when you are there take your time to stroll about reading the plats that tell you about the building or history. My children enjoyed the trip and it was good that they had a chance to visit the Forbidden City."
Do it. Worth doing and we had an interesting time. Hired a guide from out front (don't think that was 100% legal but he stayed with us the rest of the day)
"It's big, its crowded but lots to see and a lot of history. We went with our guide and I would recommend you do the same since otherwise you will miss quite a bit of the buidlings and the history behind them. Worth a visit if in Beijing and you can do the Tianamen square before since it is adjacent to here."
"Don't be confused by the strange name, this is actually The Forbidden City. An absolute must-see when in Beijing. But you wil need a Guide to explain to you the history of the place or it will simply be a collection of impressive buildings. When entering go to the right side of the complex as this is less busy than the left side. There is no entry to the Throne Room, you may only pear inside and try to take a photo. The Concubine Quarters are definitely worth a visit, interesting museum pieces displayed here, including that of the Eunuchs."
"It is almost obligatory to see Tiananmen and the Forbidden City. But I must confess, it is not that impressive. It is huge, yes. But you see it from the outside. Few of the doors are opened, and there is so much people struggling to see the interiors, we gave up. Anyway, if you do not go, how to know..."
It could take about the whole day for visitors to explore this amazing palace. You will learn a lot about the history of China-Ching dynasty during the visit which is so meaningful for people who are interested in the culture of ancient China.
This was the centre of the Chinese empire for a long time and is full of interesting buildings and history. It's a must visit if you go to Beijing and sits right in the centre of the city. I enjoyed the visit a lot but it was just too busy and a lot of the buildings were too crowded to get anywhere near. I personally preferred the hill opposite the exit gate where you can get a view of the whole city.
"My 2nd time here and this time came with a guide. The palace museum = forbidden city, and the entrance is tiananmen gate, which is all pretty confusing

Past the tiananmen gate, you enter the forbidden city, which is basically the imperial palace , and transformed into a ""museum""

You walk past imperial gate after imperial gate, and really experience the vastness of this palace and the past greatness of the emperors . You'll need a guide the explain the significance of the buildings, stone lions, 18 layer stone floors etc.

Most rooms in the palace are closed off, and the 2 or 3 opened don't have much in them. The treasures were looted and shipped to Taiwan during the civil war!

Go after lunch if you want to skip the crowds"
"The crowds can be off putting, but the artefacts are brilliant. More than 2000 years of history. The timing says 9 AM, but gates open at around 9.15 AM and weekends can mean long, but fast-moving queues. Budget at least half a day if not more."
"The Forbidden City is an amazing place in Beijing, and something everyone should see when they're in the city! The history of the Palace Museum is fascinating. The Forbidden City itself is very big, so if you want to see it all I suggest leaving at least 2 hours free for visiting.t is one of great museums in the world. It is the refine anitque palace of China whatever from the architectural design to royal family used items, no anywhere can compared with this.From there you may lean a lot of Chinese history.
The only I complaint is too many visitors."
"My wife and I spent about 4 hours walking around here, we had the audio guide which is activated by GPS to give us some insight into the history. We also paid for tickets to see the clocks and the hall of treasures (an extra 10 yuan each). As many people mentioned, it is very busy and people can be a bit pushy around the main attractions, all in all the visit was ok (the grounds and buildings are quite impressive), but the experience was average due to the crowd..."
"It took one hour from entering tianmen square, security check, line up for ticket and finally through the south gate, the new park policy enter south-exit north gate, limiting 80000 visitor per day is now implemented. So entering by north gate is no longer available.

Its a big place to explore, prepare with good shoes, umbrella, water, food etc. 2-3 hours definitely wont do but that is good for me and what average visitor recomend and before exhaustion takes over, so depends on the individual. basically the same looking structure and historical stuff, bit dusty, relic and dilapidated. Cant enter the rooms or hall, understand they have to maintain the historical value and its good too because it would tripple visiting time and you would never finish covering the grounds in one day.
Restoration works i guess will always be on going even when there are visitors. Being there to appreciate a part of history is always kind of cool and evokes some emotion eventhough not directly connected to it.
For ¥60 and an hour waiting in line to get in. Its worth it. Caution on bringing children and take care of belongings. The crowd is just too huge. To fully enjoy the historical nature in there, the only way is if the crowd is lesser but, that wont happen any time soon i guess."
"I'm thinking this review is for the Forbidden City since when we visited it was called the Palace Museum. It's somewhat confusing.... Loved the gardens around it more than the actual ""museum"" which is one identical building after another... very staid. Not to mention... a sea of humanity. But, it is worth a look."
"First visited in 1998, then 10 years later in 2008, and 2011, 2012. Last time visited, Nov 2014, it's basically still the same as before with the wonderful palaces beyond the heavenly gate. Souvenir shops are around and photo stops are available as well for you to take photos as a memory. You make the best choice. Only problem, don't come in August nor July, too HUMID AND HOT AND WORST OF ALL--CROWDED!!"
We walked around alone so didn't really get to understand much of the history. There are audio guides available which we regret not purchasing. We found it very busy and that was a 'quiet' day! Lots of walking out in the sun so come prepared.
"Amazing, even despite the hordes of people. Honestly I was dreading it beforehand due to the mob scene outside, but the place is just so absolutely awe-inspiring in scale, the other tourists didn't bother me at all. Cool muesums. Obvious must-do if you are in Beijing, but it really is as good as it's made out to be."
"The basic idea is to take a full day and start at the south end of Tienanmen Square. If you're with a local guide (recommended), you'll learn things that have never been in print about the area and it's history. I prefer not to mention some of those facts here, go there and find out what really occurred in the square and behind those Palace walls.

You work your way to the entrance of the Forbidden City, an immense complex that's both a network of palace buildings and great squares. Take lots of photos, look around, and learn the history. My only concern is that you can't enter any of the main buildings, just look in thru the doorways. There are small museums you can enter, like one dedicated to the Last Emperor. Bathrooms are available in the Forbidden City but not in the giant Square South of it. We were with an educational tour group thru Gate One."
"so much history here - be sure to rent the self-guided media player as a minimum. Again, not happy that there is a minimum character count for a review."
The sheer size of the palace is breathtaking and the rich history behind it is worth visiting! It is closed on Mondays so make sure you check the day before you go.
"Firstly go on weekday if possible. We went at 10am on a Thursday and crowds were not excessive. But note it is closed on Mondays.
Secondly if you don't read Chinese the English signposts can be confusing. You do not need ticket to enter first and second courtyards. The first ticket booths on the left are not for tickets to Palace Museum inner courtyards. They are for entry to Tiananmen building. I saw foreigners including overseas Chinese confused and queueing. Next to there is a bag storage. If you are going into Palace do not leave bag there. Due to one-way system once you enter palace museum you can only exit the North exit and cannot retrieve your bags.
The ticket booth for Palace museum is in second courtyard on left. Adults are rmb60. But if you are over 60 yrs old even foreigners can get half price ticket by showing passport.
Thirdly, when you exit at the North there is trolley bus available for rmb15 per pax going to Wangfujing and Qianmen. We found this useful to go for lunch and shopping. The trolley bus has guide pointing out interesting attractions along the route, but all in Chinese."
"I had a hard time finding this attraction on TripAdvisor because I was looking for Forbidden City, but I now see it was Formerly known as the Forbidden City, but every movie and book called it the Forbidden City, and now I can say I have walked the entire complex, thanks to our Gate 1 Tour. We began at Tiananmen Square, had popsicles for 10 cents in the entrance garden area before the ticket booths, and then walked through square after square to temple after temple along with the other groups of tourists. Do not miss the concubine area that house some 3000 year old pottery. Our guide led us to the gardens and gate at the far end, so we walked the entire complex.The history, scale, and architecture are fascinating. Definitely a six star attraction."
This is a must for any visitor to Beijing .The old great Chinese rulers handiwork.You can enjoy different tastes of the rulers.
"We visited the Forbidden City as part of the Virgin Taste of China tour and we were able to spend a couple of hours looking round. Before we visited it is fair to say that we did not know a great deal about it but thanks to the services of our guide we came away much better informed about the history of the City. Work is ongoing in restoring the buildings housed in the walled city and it is a really fascinating tour of the City. You need the services of a well informed guide who will be able to tell you some of the history of the City, who were the people living there and where they lived. It covers a large area and is a lasting monument to the rulers of China over a period of 500 years."
"Without visiting the forbidden city it is hard to imagine just how big it is, and how many sections it has. It looks very organised. Well worth seeing. We had our own guide and I think this was a good decision, as there is much to explain and point out. Others had the audio guides.
Easy to access, we went to Tiananmen Square first then through to the forbidden city through Tiananmen gate. No fee go go into the 1st part so that bit more crowded. Buy ticket at the next gate. It was raining on our visit which did spoil it a bit but wouldn't have missed it"
"Close your eyes and think of China? What do you see? Chances are you're seeing The Forbidden City in your mind's eye. Along side The Great Wall and The Terracotta Army, The Forbidden City stands out as one of the ""must-see"" locations in all of China.

Now, we visited The Forbidden City as part of a tour group on a trip to China last year and it's taken me until now to find the composure to write about the experience. That, and I'm a bit lazy, what with real life and all...

Now, the site is full of amazing buildings and structures, it's hard to know where to start and what to describe. The first thing that will probably hit you is the sheer size of the site, it's pretty big, surrounded by a wall of which the best known entrance is The Meridian Gate. The second thing to hit you is the sheer volume of people. Make no mistake, this isn't a quite stroll in the park, this place, particularly some of the more iconic buildings on the site gets rammed! I'm talking Black Friday, closing down sale, and student discount at the same time rammed! So, as usual, keep an eye on your belongings...

Perhaps the most well known structure in The Forbidden City is The Gate of Supreme Harmony leading to The Hall of Supreme Harmony - the largest hall in the city. They weren't kidding when they were naming these things, they truly are supreme. Everywhere you point your eyes you see amazing looking buildings, ornate rooftops and painted ceilings, as well as collections of vases, sculptures, paintings, and one of the largest collections of timepieces on Earth - apparently there are 1,000+ separate clocks from all around the world here.

Basically no review or piece on the interweb can adequately describe the sense of history and cultural importance of The Forbidden City, it has to be seen and experienced in person. You could easily spend a whole day in there and not see everything.

This should be a must on any sightseeing itinerary to Beijing, just make sure you enjoy being within huge swarms of people before you go, people aren't exactly friendly and will push and shove, and climb over your body to view things such as the Throne room.

Oh, one last tip. bring a face mask and your own tissues, the toilets (like many in China) are disgusting."
"Most of the Chinese people I met referred to the Palace Museum as Gu Gong. It is a massive complex and when I went mid-May was filled with thousands of people and tour groups. You don't really need to be part of a tour, you can see this immense place at your own pace with the audio guide available in many languages. Save yourself some money and be able to decide how long you want to stay by touring this independently. My max was an hour and a half inside because of the crowds.

The royal gardens were very nice and I also enjoyed walking around the perimeter from the South entrance to the East entrance- nice views of the moat. It's very open to the elements, so wear a hat, sunscreen/sunshirt"
"I expected this to be the highlight of my trip to Beijing but I must confess that I was slightly disappointed and enjoyed other places, particularly the Temple of Heaven and the Lama Temple far more. It was incredibly busy when we visited but then so was the Lama Temple so it was not just the crowds that made it slightly disappointing. Other places I visited in Beijing seemed more 'alive' - this felt far more 'museum' like even though there were few actual museum displays. The buildings of course were spectacular as one would expect but you were not allowed in to them which meant crowds gathered at the door to each one to take the obligatory photo usually with a 'selfie stick'. The whole complex is vast but the two and a half hours we were there seemed more than enough time to go past and gaze into the various palace buildings and halls. For me the best part of the visit was the Inner Court (where the Emperor, Empress and concubines actually lived) and the Imperial garden with it lovely pavilions. Obviously this is a must see site but probably best to have lower expectations than I did and then you won't be disappointed and will think it's fantastic!!!"
A show of how tiny we are. The palace is endless. Go on a cool day. It should be pleasant and educational. But the number of people inside is simply unimaginable.
"This is one of the must-visit attractions when visiting Beijing. It houses many valuable historical and cultural artifacts and exhibits. Slowly stroll through and appreciate historical and cultural information in this museum. This museum can be very crowded during holiday season. So, the required time for this attraction can end up longer than you've planned."
"The Chinese call it the Palace Museum (this was confusing to me because I was looking for 'Forbidden City').
We visited as part of our Viking Imperial Jewels of China tour, so had a tour escort and pre-purchased tickets, which takes away any hassle of queuing for entry tickets. The Tour Escort took us through the city in stages, describing what happened in each part and allowing the group to progress through a huge complex maze of rooms and courtyards with tens of thousands of other tourists. Apparently from 13 June 2015, they are going to start limiting numbers to 80,000 visitors per day.
Some highlights for us were seeing the throne rooms and the screen which Empress Dowager Cixi sat behind the throne (The Last Emperor movie), the concubine quarters still furnished and the Imperial Gardens."
"There are so many areas to explore, it's a real palace that you get to explore where others were once forbidden. Lot's of outdoor walking so bring your sun block. It was fun to see people trying on traditional clothing for photographs and to get a feel for the lifestyle of the rulers of China."
"Mostly replicas, you want the good stuff, you will need to go to Taiwan, the cultural revolution really played a bad move here. The buildings are nice though."
"What an awesome display of Ancient Chinese history in this museum. 60 Yuan got us in the door, a further 10 Yuan for the Hall of clocks, well worth it. Photos were virtually impossible to take as strictly forbidden. Watch for pick-pockets & enjoy the outing."
Very interesting to visit. I found the audio guide (available in most common languages) helpful. The gardens near the north gate are exquisite. A good insight into the lives of the rulers and their families from so long ago.
"Don't think that coming early (or late) will help you avoid the hordes of Chinese tourists. They are always there. Always. After you have been on the picture with like 10 Chinese people (if you are a Westerner, they will come to you to take your picture), you can continue to the main gate. The Chinese call it the Palace Museum (this was confusing to me because I was looking for 'Forbidden City'). The ticket boots are located on the left side (after you passed the entrance with the portrait of Mao).

The audioguide was ok. We speak Dutch and there was a Dutch version and the lady at the booth even understood 'Nederlands'. Normally, the audioguide start automatically when you pass a certain point but that didn't always work...

The center of the city is crowded with Chinese tourists. If you go to the left and right parts of the city, you can enjoy some quiet time. You can easily spend a whole day here. There's not that much to eat inside the city, mostly snacks."
"EXPERIENCE:
I love love love visiting places like the forbidden city. I love learning about the past, about China's history, about ancient things. This was an unforgettable experience even though I wasn't able to visit the entire place during my visit. The buildings are beautiful and the place is so so big!! Because I watch a lot of Chinese drama about Chinese ancient history, I enjoyed visiting the palace even more. I would picture the scenes in the dramas while walking pass the areas that are similar to the scenes. You'll be walking on some improvised staircases which are slightly more to the side instead of the nicely carved stairs that are in the middle.
You aren't allowed to walk into each of the rooms either as they are blocked with metal bars to preserve the rooms as they are. The rooms are dusty inside and the smell isn't very pleasant...you can feel a small breeze coming from inside sometimes which feels nice on a hot day (except the smell). You can see the dust on the furnitures..
They start closing some doors inside the palace around 4:30 and start kicking you out around 4:45. You'll be seeing people in scooters honking and yelling at you to make you leave the palace.

I went on a Friday around 3pm...needed more time...since they started to kick us out around 4:30 :(

TIPS:
Make sure to arrive there early to have enough time to visit the whole palace and to avoid huge crowds and the sizzling sun.

Go on a weekday instead of weekend to avoid huge huge crowds

If you're afraid of sunburns, getting tan, or hate the heat, you could bring an umbrella like the rest of the mainlanders

Bring water and snacks!! The prices in the palace are usually double if not triple...and there's not a lot to choose from

Some parts of the floor have holes(needs to be paved again) and if you walk too fast, you might sprain your ankle...so be careful.

HOURS: 8:30AM to 5:00PM everyday

PRICES:
The ticket is ¥60 for adults and the automatic guide is ¥40 for all languages except mandarin which is half the price (¥20)."
"An amazing place to see. Very unusual by American standards. The buildings are generally not open, but if you review the map and have a walk through, you get a pretty good idea of the history."
"My wife and I were surprised by the hugeness and the long lasting architecture of the various buildings in that area. The detailed design and the beauty of the architecture is hard to fathom as they didn't have the computerized skills we now have. Also, be ready for a constant stream of visitors."
"The Forbidden City aka Palace Museum is an amazing site. Be sure to take in the details from the statues, to the stone drain pipes (dragons), the paint used at each gate. Be sure to pay extra to see the Clock room, and the Hall of Jewelry...both very impressive. The gardens in the back are also a sight to experience. This place takes the whole day so don't try to rush through it."
"I got a chance to pay a short visit to the palace. The buildings, monuments and other historic stuffs were pretty interesting. The entire place takes about 2 hours to see completely."
"This is a place I spent much of my time as I love museums.
I disliked having to leave and visit other remarkable places."
"Fantastic landmark, if you have only 1 option to visit in beijing this should be it. But be ready to share with thousands of other visitors (mostly domestic)"
"we couldn't believe our eyes when Mainlanders do the poo-culture even in The Palace!!

mind your steps for all the pee, poo and spit! nevertheless, this place worths a visit, at least once in your lifetime."
"We booked out trip as an all-inclusive from Canada, there are a few different packages in price and we did pick one of the few hundred dollars more believe me it was all worth it!

Our entire trip from Beijing all the way to Quilin, our agenda was top knocks, from Hotels, foods, attractions. We never have to wait at any entrance at all, there always a different door for us to get in without waiting in line which saving so much time for us. (Remember this is China, with massive people traveling, so a long line in any attraction you are visiting is typical).

Forbidden City, the empire ended under the Qing Dynasty 1911. This is a massive scale of Architecture and engineering at the time, it should be 9999 rooms ( at the present time it may only 1/3 still in the maintenance and restoring )to house the Emperor with one empress plus 3000 concubines then maids, servants , Eunuchs and so on….They did picked the best land to crated this enormous buildings, the art works, the hand crafts creating into details in each stone stature, each door, each Conner, each Hall, each Room, each Roof are represent the ranks of inner city of those women who live to sever the Emperor or higher ranks official ( inside the city beside the emperor then no male is allowed , even the prince has to move out after reaching certain age).

Over the years, I have been watching too many movies; dramas about this world wonder, standing in the middle of Forbidden City, my heart just dissolve into the felling of those women who would not make out to this high wall …. You must read ahead before your trip, I will make it so much more interesting and understanding view. As for me I am proud to say “I have been there” whenever I am watching my new drama from now on :)

Here is the links: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forbidden_City"
Set aside lots of time to view the enormous site and arrive early. Also would suggest getting a guide but be careful of random people out front offering to guide you. The official government guides can be very good and their price is quite reasonable.
"I had no idea how big this is. The scale of the palaces and grounds is second to none in the world. Be advised, it can be very busy.
It is an absolute must see in Beijing."
"If possible, do not visit the Forbidden City on Sunday. You will be greeted with throngs of people that sometimes all you can see are heads. The vast land area still allows for beautiful photos of this wonder of architecture but the pleasure of sightseeing experience is diminished greatly than if you go where there are less people.

Nonetheless, it's still a must visit!"
"It's a massive place and worth a visit.. Try and go early and on a weekday as this place, like any other in China, gets crowed as the day progresses. Also this place gets closed after 3pm and full day on Mondays.. So plan your trip accordingly."
"2nd time in the Forbidden City and it still amazes me. The architecture and the details are so intricate. A must see in Beijing. We came on a Sunday, it was packed but I suppose it is packed every single day of the year. The queue for tickets can take easily an hour.

The palace is huge and seems never ending. If the sun was not so hot, we will probably spend a little more time here. We also took pictures wearing the costumes from the ancient Chinese. What an experience! The Imperial Garden was the nicest area in our opinion. If there were fewer people, we would have enjoyed it more."
"I spent a whole day at the Forbidden City and it was amazing. It's history just before your eyes. I learned a lot and was impressed by the size of all this. It's better than ""chinese versailles"""
For someone who is interested in ancient cultures. Best to have a guide who can give you all the information concerning the ancient artefacts.Vast area to cover in one day.
"Definitely a must see if you come to Beijing, but expect a lot of people, most rude people. Our guide said this was not even the busy season yet and there were tons of people pushing us. Be careful if you have small kids, it's easy to lose track of them with all the people. The city itself is huge and the architecture is amazing. It does get pretty hot because there is no shading so bring sunblock and lots of water"
Well..sorry to say i loved it. I got my directions in details and directions written in cue cards by my wife so i knew how to go!!!!!
"When you see a living thing you've seen many times on film may be disappointed to impress more or to experience a strange feeling, but it will not stay indifferent. I can say that I imagined it right, but the architectural ensemble is superb with fantastic sonturi of buildings and wonderful color combinationWell, hang in there - there all sorts of military, police and bodyguards, but that only reinforces the sense of realism."
"If you are not used to jostling a hundred people out of your way to see big dark rooms with few artifacts, then this place is not for you. Went on a Monday to see the Forbidden City and still got jostled around pretty good. Staff are brusque unless you appeared obviously to be a foreigner (I.e., blond hair blue eyes). Drinks and food are expensive so if you go, bring food and water. The imperial garden is nice but at the very very back of the compound. If you happened to exit at the back of the compound, I recommend taking the green tourist bus to get back to the front. You would be crushed up against other tourists, but at least you won't have to walk 45 minutes back to the front and then have to wait an hour in line to get through the security gates, crushed against other tourists. Overall, did not enjoy it. At all!"
"To get a full appreciation of some of the history of China, this place is a ""must see"". You will be at risk of seeing too many fantastic palaces, and you really do need a good guide to take you round the site. It does go on and on and on, and in my opinion is pretty special as a place to visit."
"Come very early (before the opening) if you want to avoid big groups of tourists.
Few shops inside but nothing to eat, so bring eventually something.
It is quite big. You'll need around 2 hours of time."
"Beautiful palace buildings, wonderfully preserved and on a vast scale. In spite of the crowds, this was a hugely enjoyable experience. We were led by a Beijing-based tour guide who took us along the quieter side route rather than straight down the middle, and told us interesting stories about the Emperors and their concubines. This gave us some historical context it was possible to use our imaginations and picture palace life as lived when this was a closed city. Highlights were: Golden Water, the Gate of Supreme Harmony, the lion statues, the marble carriageway, roof guardians, the hall of supreme harmony, hall of middle harmony an d hall of preserving harmony and the gate of heavenly purity. We exited via the Imperial Gardens, which were interesting, and then along the large moat around the palace."
Save your money... don't hire a tour. An audio guide is available for a nominal fee ($5) in many languages that give a decent overview of the facility. Just make sure you leave >3 hours to visit!!
"The well preserved Emperor's Palace of China is definitely the number one destination for your visit to Beijing. Immerse yourself and imagine the life of the Emperors, Empress, concubines and eunuchs. Awesome experience!"
"The complex is fast.

We went with a tour, totally unsatisfactory.

We got a glimpse of the place. Only to the hall of supreme harmony.

The Chinese tourist can be quite nasty when viewing the hall of supreme harmony. There are only 4 openings to see inside the hall and people are jamming themselves to get a glimpse inside the hall. A very old women basically elbowed me and wife, really hard, to clear a path for her. People are pushing each other, almost a stampede. A very old man tried to use the opportunity to touch my wife inappropriately. Be careful when you are trying to look inside the hall.

I would go here again though, don't mind wandering whole day."
"So much history at the Palace Museum and things to learn about ancient China. Yes it is very crowded but it's hard to imagine going to Beijing without visiting. The sheer size of the place is overwhelming, so wear comfy shoe. If you're really into learning about the history and learn the stories, I'd suggest getting a guide for the visit, a real person and not just the headsets."
"I live in Beijing and every time I walk into the Forbidden City I get chills. This is one of my favourite things to see in Beijing, it's simply amazing."
"This Palace Museum is a time machine which brings you back to Ming and Qing (pronounced as Ching) dynasty. By entering the museum, you are going back to 500 years before and stepping into the home of 24 emperors of Ming and Qing Dynasty.

For those who has visited the National Palace Museum of Taipei before, please drop the expectations that you are going to stay indoor and looking at artifacts. They are different in the way that The Palace Museum of Beijing has both indoor and outdoor, and not advisable to go during rainy or stormy days.

Besides the fact that it is the home of total 24 emperors, what else that attract visitors throughout the world flocking to this old wooden palace? The magnificent palace has total of 980 buildings and covers 72 hectar of land. (However, only a small part of it is open to public) Also, this palace has been listed as UNESCO World Heritage Site as the largest wooden palace in the world.

Even though a great numbers of artifacts are kept in National Palace Museum of Taipei, we still can see a fair amount of artifacts here. (but the entrance fee of timepieces and jade collections is not included in your RMB60 Palace Museum ticket)

If you plan to visit the palace as solo or couple visitors, without tour guide, it's advisable to rent an audio guide. Audio guide in Chinese language is RMB20 while other languages is RMB40, and to be returned at the exit point. Another option is to hire a tour guide from the customer service counter. The cost is RMB250, with the maximum of 5 visitors in a group. Additional charges of RMB10 applies for every extra headcount.

From the exit point, you are pretty far from the MRT station. What you can do is to take the shuttle bus, Line 1 or Line 2, depends on your next stop. This special tour bus charges you RMB10 per pax and bring you around the nearby attractions with a tour guide inside. Just tell her your next stop and she will tell you where to alight.

And, the last thing is ENJOY your trip to Palace Museum!"
"As one of the most well-known features of Beijing, you should make sure not to miss the Forbidden City during your visit. The architecture is beautiful and there are some very pretty gardens. It would probably take about two hours to stroll through. 60¥ per person for admission, pretty reasonable."
"Nothing downtown Beijing (museums and such) are open Monday.... Don't waste the trip, only open Tuesday-Sunday.

You can enter the walls of Forbidden City, but you can't get into the palace at all. Also, one direction walk through the walls of the Forbidden City. Once you find out it's all closed you can't back-track to get back to Tiananmen Square."
The emperor certainly knew how to protect himself and his family. With six massive walls surrounding what feels like peeling another layer we really where mesmerized by the spectacular size and significance of this place.
The place is huge and very popular. It deserves at least half a day in order to see the less obvious parts. The temptation is simply to walk through the centre of the complex with everybody else. The queue for entrance tickets can be quite daunting. Information available in many languages via audio guides. Well wort a visit.
"This is a must see in Beijing. The place has incredible structures and history attach to it. Everything inside has meaning and might take you more than a day just to understand the history. We content ourselves just to tour around for about 3 hrs and it's just simply amazing to see the palace, the rooms, the garden and carvings. It's a city within a city and really huge. There are also massive beautiful stone carvings and makes me wonder how where they able to do this in the past with no cutting machines etc...

History here is very rich. You get to feel the past due to the way they preserve the forbidden city.
There were new improvements but still with a touch of China's rich culture."
"I visted the Forbidden city in mid May 2015. Crowd wasnt too big, quite inexpensive and definitely worth a visit whilst in Beijing. What i did note is that although the site is thousands of years old the buildings and attractions within them are lacking authenticity. Much of the structures and historical elements of the place are long gone due to fire or vandalism and the place really didnt hit the mark for me from a historical point of view. For instance the day i visited there were workers building a hall from scratch which really took away from similar experiences ive encountered in other acient sites around the world. The other thing i noted was how repetitive the place is. I was over it within 15 mins. The city is a series of gates ultimately protecting the emperor's residence however they are almost identical which can get old quickly. The gardens at the end are quiet nice and tranquil. Overall worth a visit but dont go in with massive expectations."
"this is also know as forbidden city.

this city is good peice of architect and very huge. you can see the big rooms and furtniture and royal garden.

must advise to go on top and see from 45 degree from where you can get the whole view of the palace. it take you around 3 hours to visit."
"This is great day spent,the lines can get pretty long to go through security checkpoint to get into palace museum.if you just want to visit the museum which there is alot to see in the palace grounds Just follow the crowd but if you want the full forbidden city sightseeing ticket do not cross the bridge to enter palace,instead the2 large ticket booths on either side of the entrance sells a complete forbidden city pass."
"we've all seen pics of the Forbidden City but until you enter through the gates you won't realize the scale of the place....and then you step into the next courtyard and you get blown away by what surrounds you....and then you reach the next courtyard and you wonder how they could fit what you see into the space....and then you venture into the next space and your eyes open wide again. to me the architecture and coloration is all similar but with different variations of scale, height and width. no matter what it is still WOW. please pardon all the fellow tourists who may get in your line of sight when taking a photo. be prepared for the mass of Chinese visitors who may be visiting Beijing for the first time. you can spend an immense amount of time here if you desire or you can just enjoy the parts you want to see (though some have additional fees). despite the crowds you can find plenty of areas where you can take a break and enjoy the view."
"It's huge, you could spend hours exploring it! Just seeing that many people wandering around is pretty amazing. Very overwhelming."
"Initially I was going to skip visiting the Forbidden City, although that seems like sacrilege. It sounded rather boring to see building after building that look very similar and the reports of the crowds made me really not want to go.

I went there early on a weekday. I was there early by Western standards, but not Chinese ones ;)
I got to the ticket booths around 7:45 and there was already a line formed. The ticket booth opened right at 8:30 and initially moved very slowly, but then sped up. The security line moved fast though.

Once I was inside the palace, everyone walked in a steady stream to the main buildings, but I usually stayed off to the sides and I was the only person doing that. I did peek in some of the main buildings, especially the living quarters, but was fine with missing out on some of them in order to avoid the throngs of people (though I have to say it really wasn't bad at all at that time). I loved going off to the sides and it was fun to image what life must have been like when the Palace was in use. It was nice and peaceful in many of the parts of the compound. It was very impressive to see the magnitude first hand. I didn't hit any big crowds really until I got the gardens at the end (which were lovely). I am glad I ended up coming here."
"I'm not sure how this can be anything other than five stars. It is the centerpiece of China and has been for hundreds of years. Yes the crowds are oppressive, welcome to China and Beijing in particular.

For less than $10 you can see one of the greatest complexes built by man. The history and sense of grandeur are palpable, and if you get off the well beaten path and into some of the side areas, you can find moments of solitary peace and contemplation to imagine what it would have been like to be in the lap of luxury yet a prisoner of your own home.

Clearly not something to be missed.

Just a couple of quick points; you can no longer enter through the north gates, only through the Tianenmen side and the tea house and rickshaw scams are alive and well upon exiting by jianshang park. Also cab drivers are near extortionate. Push and you can get a break, but will likely still pay double what you paid to get there to get home again."
"The Forbidden City complex is huge and beautiful. The paint work on the eaves of the buildings is amazing, and the Imperial Garden has some amazing trees. However, I expected a little bit more information about what it was actually like when the emperor and others lived there. You can't go into most of the buildings and it's tough to visualize what life was actually like. If I went again, I would probably get the audio guide. Students, show your ID! I got in for 20rmb with a Canadian university ID."
"Most important of all when planning to visit the Forbidden City is that you should not underestimate the size of the Palace; It is a vast complex of buildings and courtyards with many different directions to wander off and explore before returning to the centre and moving on.

The buildings and their contents become increasingly impressive so if you are short on time, if the crowds are especially busy or if anyone in your group is likely to grow weary of the tedious process of walking 200 yards, photographing a building, joining a slow queue to peer inside and snap a few photos before walking the next 200 yards then feel free to quickly move through the first four or five courtyards. Certainly we found the gardens at the North exit to be amongst the most beautiful part of the complex especially compared to the restored and furnished Royal Apartments which force you to peer through dirty windows to snatch the barest glimpse.

At each entrance and exit you'll find the usual local sellers with souvenirs and refreshments."
"I was determined to see the palace complex and Forbidden City while in Beijing, and it was an ordeal to say the least, but I am not sorry I went. We waited in line for close to two hours to get through security on a Sunday morning. If you don't purchase tickets to see the palace museum you can't go farther than the first couple of courtyard areas. Once inside the museum section it is difficult to see the throne rooms because of all the crowds pushing and shoving. It was handy to be a little taller than many people because I was able to get my camera higher to take some pictures of the buildings you can't enter. The Imperial Garden was a welcome relief from the acres of hot rocks and buildings. There are some incredibly beautiful buildings in the garden, as well. I would not go back should I ever be in Beijing again, but in spite of the huge crowds, pushing and shoving, it was worth the effort to go once. I got to walk on the same ground I have seen in countless movies about Chinese history."
"The Palace Museum/Forbidden City is a massive, impressive complex. All the buildings have a similar red exterior with gold roofs, but the special part is the interior decoration: gorgeous painted ceilings, thrones, richly carved columns, etc. Be sure to check out the Clock Gallery and the Treasury for some rich treasures you wouldn't otherwise see up close. The damper on our visit here was the crushing and pushy crowds along the main axis of the palace (go into the side palaces or galleries if you need a break as I did). The palace is something you should see in Beijing, but be prepared to be a little overwhelmed at the size of the palace and the crowds."
"The Palace Museum is a huge complex of marvelous buildings and courtyards with traditional Chinese artwork and yellow roofs. You can enter from Tian'anmen square, where you should be prepared for a security check. It is free to visit from Tian'anmen gate to Meridian gate, after which an entrance ticket needs to be bought (RMB 60). Some local tour guides offer their services at the entrance to cut lines. For the two of us, we got a quote of RMB 480, for the guidance RMB 300 and for the ticket RMB 180 (asking for an extra 60!), which was ridiculous. We got our tickets in 10 minutes and conveniently visited the main sights in 90 minutes. Of course, a whole day could have been spent here if we had the time. On the weekend it was rather crowded, locals recommended weekdays to visit."
"The Palace Museum is really a must-see in Beijing. It's an incredibly important landmark in Chinese history and the literal center of the city.

The crowds are really make this location tough to enjoy. You will be pushed and may see a glimpse of a throne room if you can stand the environment. I chose to be on the outskirts and take in the architecture and pure expansiveness of the space - so in that case it was an enjoyable stroll through Chinese history.

I was disappointed that you were charged for a ticket and then charged again if you wanted to go to certain sections of the palace. It felt as though they were squeezing money from you. Also, I would not recommend the audio tour. It's 40 RMB and not super informative. There are signs in English throughout the palace that provide historical and cultural context."
"It is undeniable that the sheer scale of this undertaking is colossal, which is what its builders intended it to be. Every visitor to China should see it, true, but the visit is not a very enjoyable one. It is vast, and on a hot day very tiring to get around. But the main problem is the sheer numbers of people on the site. The crowds are relentless. It is difficult at times to move around, let alone take decent photographs. The crowds dull the sense of history I normally experience. Thinking back after the visit, all the magnificent but similar buildings merge together in your mind into one large red building.
The Emperors' gardens are quite exquisite, but again impossible to enjoy properly due to the crowds.
I am glad I went, another thing to cross off my list, but there are so many better travel experiences to be had in China!"
"I visited the Palace Museum in early May. I think it's a must-seeing attraction when you travel in Beijing, it's a good place to learn the culture and history of China. But just a little bad is that, there are too many people, and a little crowded, arrange the travel schedule according to the actual situation will be much better I think."
"It is a very interesting insight into the past and the culture of early China. I found the crowds were not too bad, however if you suffer from claustrophobia I recommend getting there early. Our guide was very good, but that will be a later review"
"We went to forbidden city already with low expactations and it was quite that. Huge wall palace to walk and nothing much to see. Very repetitive red buildings using exaustively the word harmony! I considered heaven palace and summer palace a better attraction with older history and with better views. If you dont have to much time, i advise the heaven palace."
"The place is impressive itself in terms of its history but it is very badly managed. The crowds are unbelievable and its hard to enjoy it. Actually, impossible to enjoy it. Much better place to go is Summer Palace where you can actually stop for few minutes without being pushed etc."
"First and most important, to really enjoy and understand what you are seeing here, you really should have a guide with you to give you a real insight and be able to answer the many questions that you will most likely have. We were on a private tour and we really enjoyed it because we talked with our guide (Angel from tour.beijing, Champaign Travel) and she was very knowledgeable about the Chinese history we were seeing. There is a lot of walking, but you stop and go and you just keep going and going. There are a lot of people, but the area is very very large so you have a lot of room to spread out. Bring water, if it gets warm, because there really is nowhere to buy it while you are touring the grounds. Before you go through the Forbidden City, you will stop at Tiananmen Square first which is a short time visit before the larger tour. Took a lot of pictures because I love architecture, and there is a lot of beautiful structures that are very interesting and detailed to enjoy. This is a big part of Chinese History. Glad that we visited this."
"This massive palace ground contains so much history and with some of the builds beautifully restored, it's a must see for Beijing. The concentric ""ring"" of buildings provides awesome views of the palace."
"Anyone who saw The Last Emperor must come here, and it's magnificent. The grounds, bridges, temples, carvings, steps, and so on are well worth the visit. We went during the week and crowds weren't too bad. Loved seeing it all, quite impressive. Was in awe much of the time."
Amazing to see the palace where the emperors used to live. I regret I did not rent an audio guide or booked a guide for the visit. It's so huge!
"Palace museum, formerly known as the Forbidden City. Very large and full of interesting buildings, but grossly overcrowded, with people pushing a jostling to look into the various rooms where one was not able to go inside."
Was an amazing place but go early to avoid crowds. The general admission ticket does NOT get you in everywhere which is disappointing.
The Forbidden City is simply overwhelming in size and the history of it. I don't think it would advisable to do it without a guide as they assist with getting tickets and give a brief history of the huge complex and share some facts at each point. It was not possible to view everything as we only had a few hours. During March it was not too crowded but can imagine that it could get quite busy in the warmer months. The views into the various buildings and rooms are a bit limited but the feeling of being there was awesome.
"Be patient with the lineups, they are not as bad as Tian'anmen Square. Enjoy the fortifications and row upon row of gates and moats. Admire the carvings and of course the temple roof corners."
"not worth it at all as most of the palace is not accessible and only can view from outside. second, its too crowded. plus the time I went was raining, its freaking cold. didn't really enjoy it."
The information supplied at the palace museum was helpful for the visitation of the Forbidden City. Very good map.
"The Forbidden City is simply magnificent, but it's waaaay too crowded.
If you manage, come very early in the morning, otherwise you'll have literally to wrestle to take some pictures (no kidding...)
Once you are done, reach the top of the Jingshan (Coal Hill) Park.
From there you'll enjoy a fantastic view of the whole city.
Simply amazing..."
"First of all most part of the palace is inaccessible. The part of palace which is accessible can only be seen far far away from the door. For example, to see the King's chair, we can only stare 10m away from the corridor. This goes to all other part of the palace. I find that it is no point going to Beijing to visit Palace Museum and just sit infront of tv to see as it is much clearer (view of the chair) with better explanations."
"Along with the Grand Palace, the forbidden city is, to my knowledge, the most amazing man made structure in Asia. The tour takes 2-3 hours. The audio guides are very helpful and they have a dozen of languages available. A must see!"
"No visit to Beijing would be complete without a visit to the Forbidden City. This immense site contains hundreds of individual buildings, several dozen courtyards, formal gardens,
and a number of exhibits of royal artifacts. It was the home of
Chinese emporers in two dynasties for nearly 500 years, as well
as the seat of government. The architecture is stunning, and
their are numerous stone carvings, statues, and oddities. The
site cannot be seen in less than half a day, and even then there
are many aspects that you will miss on your first visit. Reading
about the palace complex in detail prior to the vist would be wise, and a good guide or book to assist is invaluable.

Be prepared for enormous numbers of visitors sincve this is one
of the premier tourist attractions in the world's most populous
country, and in a city of 21 million."
"I had not heard it referred to as ""The Palace Museum"", Have always heard it referred to as the Forbidden City, either way it is a must see atleast once while in Beijing. A good guide is needed to help explain in context what you are seeing."
It was incredible. There's so much history. We had a fantastic time. This is an absolute must to see in Beijing.
"After 5000 reviews before me I have not much more to add, go there! Impressive, huge, crazy people trying to get a picture of an ancient throne (or other stuff in the same category). Interesting clock museum, very nice garden in the back part of the forbidden city. Take at least have a day!"
"Definitely worth a visit. The largest Imperial residence in the world occupies 720000 sq meters. You need at least half a day to see the highlights located along the main axis, and a full day for a longer route encompassing the buildings in two side parts.
The entrance is through the south gate, exit through the north gate. The audio guide is not bad, if works properly (ours did not)."
"It seems odd that the commonly used name 'Forbidden City' is only attached to restaurants and hotels on TripAdvisor, as that is how I imagine most people think of it.

The main impression that it left us with was the sheer size; as you reach each pavilion you think you must be nearing the end, only to be confronted with another large open area and a further pavilion in the distance. It comes almost as a surprise when you reach the end.

What it does illustrate is the scope of Chinese imperial power, and the proportion of the then unknown concept of GDP used in creating this huge series of imperial and administrative buildings.

It is a definite 'must see', however crowded it is (and it will be crowded). It is also a useful introduction to the need to display nifty footwork and sharp elbows in China if one is not to be simply brushed aside by the large number of internal tourists.

It will take time to get through it, so ensure that your programme reflects this."
"Visited the site while in Beijing. The history/story is way more intriguing than the actual palace itself, but it sets an excellent stage to tell the story.

As an English only speaking tourist strongly suggest you pick up a guide at front entrance as opposed to the automated headsets. It provides a more personal touch. Our group of (5) paid a total of 300 RMB for roughly 3 hours of touring. They are easy to find, as we stuck out which made it easy."
"The palace is currently undergoing a 15 year renovation programme. The buildings are beautiful and between each group of buildings there are enormous paved squares. The whole site is huge (180 acres) and you need a good 2 hours to get a sense of what is here. Half a day would be better. You are able to see through windows and doors to view the inside of most buildings and the contents and decoration are well worth the push through the crowds. The Forbidden City was begun in the 15th century and encompasses palaces, gardens, quarters for the Imperial family and offices for bureaucrats."
"Centuries of history and an architectural wonder, the entire complex is humbling to experience. Nothing else exists on this scale and grandeur, and it is worthwhile spending as long as possible here, at your own pace.
Despite the crowds, the ticketing is well organised, staff helpful and there are plenty of places to rest and take it all in. The changes in China over the last few decades are reflected in the visitors and it is wonderful to see locals coming to admire the achievements of their own culture."
A must see while in Beijing and very interesting but don't miss Jingshan Park to the north. Beautiful view of the Forbidden City.
"A must see in Beijing. There are options to rent the English audio guide machine (my version wasn't working as well). It would have been great to purchase the tickets ahead of time and you do get discounts for tickets if you are a student with proof of ID.

There is long security lines for entrance outside Mao's portraits. I would budget the whole day if you want to see the entire city. There are other possible exploration modes of 2 or 4 hours. Do bring lots of snacks and water. However, there are MANY small souvenir shops that sell gifts and food throughout the grounds.

This place is a must visit!"
"It is fantastic to be able to see the splendor of a palace fit for a King. Definitely worth the trip. It is nice to see so many securities and guards in the place. However, those guards should be used to orderly and lined the visitors at each place for viewing ie people are just pushing to the door ways to view the throne etc. If a proper orderly line is in place then everyone can have the chance to view and take photos without having to push themselves to the from."
Wow what an interesting place to visit. For individuals who really want to understand China and it's history a great place to pay a visit
Very interesting site but it is hard to see the main areas due to the shear number of visitors. be prepared to elbow you way through endless tour parties if you want a good view of the main rooms. Much better when you get away from the central area which is the only areas the organised tours visit.
"The Palace Museum is a complex of many buildings. Most of them can be seen only from the outside. The rooms don""t have lots of furniture. Also the place is overcrowded. The security check alone to enter the complex took us about half an hour. If you have to decide to see one place - prefer the Summer palace. Much more interesting."
Walking through these magnificent buildings gives one a sense of the lives of the former rulers. The yellow and red structures are grand and well preserved.
"The Forbidden City is a huge complex. I was part of a tour group, and it is certainly worthwhile having a guide with you to explain the history of the complex and each area that you visit. You cannot quite believe how large this complex is, but when you consider the number of people housed here can certainly see why it needed the amount of space that it takes up. You can look through the windows into a number of different rooms to view what was in the rooms and see the ornaments and furniture on display. There are lovely gardens in some areas and a food area where you can purchase ice creams and a variety of different meals. It was quite busy when I was there but not overly crowded. It was great to see many of the Chinese tourists dressing up in the Emperor and Concubine outfits having their photos taken near the exit.

You need to be careful when walking around as the surface is quite uneven in parts and you can easily trip over. You definitely need about 3 hours to walk around the Forbidden City.

This is a fascinating place and a must see in Beijing."
Visited the 2nd time but never fails to amaze! Imagine life when it was occupied by the Emperors of China during its heydays. Every nook and cranny of the museum tells its own unique story. A visit of a lifetime!
"Nice place, but I bet it is waay more interesting if you have a guide to tell you about the history. We were just walking around taking pictures.. Not really something i recommend. Find a guide!!"
I hadn't really appreciated the scale of the Forbidden City so it was a revelation to visit. An absolute must-see on any trip to Beijing
"Always wanted to visit the Forbidden city but somehow couldn't manage it even though I traveled to Beijing a few times. This time availed the opportunity and was amazed.
You feel a part of the history when you walk through this vast property. There are so many POIs within the complex that you can spend hours together. But then it gets tiring as it is a long walk so generally one needs to optimize it in about 2 to 3 hours.
For travelling to the ticket counter from main road, conveyance is available but after the exit again it is a long walk.
Overall a wonderful experience !!"
"The guide books and online information show you why you need to visit. If you have been before, go again - 10 visits would not be sufficient to see this place properly. This is history in tangible form. One can only be grateful that the Chinese authorities have preserved it for the world to see. It is a Chinese national treasure but it is more than that: without exaggeration, the Forbidden City is truly a glory of world heritage.

You will encounter unbelievable crowds. You will be pushed, jostled and given no personal space at all. If you want to see things properly you will need to be assertive - not aggressive, but not shy - and push your way to the front: if you don't, everyone else will. But remember the Forbidden City is on every Chinese person's bucket list too; and they are not being rude when they jostle, just acting in a way considered normal and inoffensive.

I strongly recommend you go with a guide. If you can afford a private guide you should arrange one in advance. It doesn't get you past any lines but you will understand more of what you are seeing.

Don't miss the exhibitions in the Treasury - an amazing exhibition of timepieces (mostly clocks) and, separately (for another entry ticket, not expensive), an exhibition of jewelry and some phenomenal, massive pieces (weighing tons) of intricately carved jade."
"We visited the forbidden City in the beginning of april. It was very crowded due to a Chinese holiday. You couldn´t explore, just had to follow the stream of people."
"We visited here 28 years ago and it is still as impressive as before. The difference is that now you can not enter the main temples but can only look inside. Also, 28 years ago we were there with about 20 other people, now about 20 thousand other people. Welcome to the ""new"" China, but that is part of the experience. Still the highlight of any trip to Beijing."
"Years ago I watched the film 'The last Emperor', and from then on wanted to see the Forbidden City, and was really pleased to visit during a tour of China last November. The sheer size of this is amazing, it just seems to go on forever. There are different sections separated by open squares. Apparently the Emperor had 3000 concubines, with their children, and other servants, etc. These numbers give you some idea of the amount of rooms there. Some of the buildings have been restored, but others need restoring. There are some of the original fittings in some rooms, but many have been removed. The Emperor has a dressing room, where it used to take him 4 hours to dress for meetings. We didn't have a problem with crowds, but we visited when Beijing was rationing car use because of Barack Omaba's visit. Well worth a visit."
"The size of the complex is incredible. It is hard to believe that an Emperor lived here with his various wives, concubines etc.... The pomp and ceremony can only be guessed at. It would be amazing to go back in time and spend a day here!"
"Like many of the other reviewers have said this is a must see. It is also very crowded with locals enjoying their history. At times it is deafening as hundreds of competing tour guides each with a microphone and speaker, tell their group the history of the Forbidden City. Despite all of this we are pleased we went."
"I did the forbidden city or the Palace Museum alone on our last morning in Beijing, while the rest of the family slept in at the hotel. Being alone allowed me to move quickly & not worry about a lot of other issues, like baby food, stroller friendliness, etc that we now look for. But having said that, I made observations of those none the less (guess by default). Mentioned along is my experience from yesterday morning:

Getting there: Forbidden City is easily reachable. Get off at either Tiananmen East or West & a 5-7 mins walk will get you to the entrance of the venue. Tickets are available only from 8.30 AM to 4 PM except Monday, when the place is closed. The venue itself is open until 5 PM on all days, except Monday of course.

The details: tickets are available on the inside, once you enter the South gate (the one that has Chairman Mao's picture). The ticket counters sell only the entrance tickets & for self guided tours, there is a separate counter post the security check. Cost of the ticket is ¥60 per head (children below 1.2 meters go free, if accompanied by an adult). There are additional costs for doing the Clock Tower & the treasure gallery. Post the ticket purchase, there is a security check & right after is a counter where one can pick up the self guided tours. Like with most places, a choice of languages are available. It costs about ¥40 for a self guided tour apparatus & there is no play back. So once you've visited a particular area, it does not give you details more than once.

The Amenities: the Forbidden City is huge & the excesses of the Qing & Qin dynasty is for everyone to see. In terms of stroller friendliness, it's kind of mixed. There are lots of open spaces where a stroller can be used, but the stairs are not stroller friendly at all. Food is limited inside the complex & even right outside. As a result, it is recommended that you carry your own water & snacks, as required. Lots of open spaces to sit down and relax a bit, if you feel the need (recommend the garden near the twelve palaces right at the back as it's very pleasant with lots of shade).

The outside: Getting out at the north entrance, I headed to Jingshan park, which is a 300 meters climb via stairs to get a birds eye view of the forbidden city. No - a stroller cannot be used. The view is tremendous from the top & I recommend spending a few minutes taking it all in. There is also an area where you can dress your kids or yourself up in traditional Chinese costumes & get photos taken. There is a Buddha statue at the very top & the overall experience is positive. The park at the base boasts of multiple flora & fauna and to some that might be of interest too. Right outside the park, there are multiple rickshaws who offer a trip around hutongs - if you choose to do it, then make sure you bargain.

Getting back: Once out of the North Gate, there are limited options available. In my case, I walked almost a couple of kms East (to the right with your back to the gate) before I found Donsi Subway station. I believe the cabs don't stop there and there is a bit of a walk before you can find a place where the cabs stop. Alternatively, you can take the rickshaw, visit the hutongs & then get dropped off at a cab station or the subway."
"Beijing's main site to see the awe of how the emperors ruled. It's so big, flat and crowded. Prepare yourself - queues don't exist or at least etiquette of waiting in line.
It's really stunning as you approach the main gate arrow tower. Opening up into the 5 bridges and main throne. It's a highlight. Keep going to the 2 other thrones then sleeping quarters and concubine quarters. I really enjoyed the garden area. The stone and flatness is overwhelming but the gardens are a nice respite from the palace.
It's crowded but that's expected."
"We went around 11am and that was already busy..so I have to share the former feelings totally:: Yes, the palace is very impressive and a must see introduction to chinese history. I'm glad I went, but after a short while I was ready to escape. The flow of tour buses with domestic tourists is endless, and the tourists push and shove their way to peer through the windows of the various buildings. It was not easy to escape these crowds.... and this was mid-week in April 20th. I shudder to think how crowded it is on weekends in high season.

The highlight was watching the soldiers do drills The second best highlight was the feeling of relief when I exited the complex and headed to hotel due to overheating..."
"We came to Chine for our first visit at the end of March, and wherever we went we became increasingly thankful for this fact! No queues for tickets , no vast crowds of people and the possibility to linger and admire the beauty of this place , but also to get a real sense of its size and complexity.
You could easily spend a week exploring this place, but on a short 5 day visit we only had time to admire the Palace itself , without delving into its specialist museum collections. The scale of the ensemble of buildings is just staggering and when the ongoing refurbishment of the whole complex is complete it will be a true rival to legendary Xanadu! Once through the main South / North main axis of halls and palaces, wander off into the hidden corners of the gardens : in March it is a riot of plum blossom!"
"I was blown away! This was the first place my Chinese hosts took me at the start of a two-week visit so it was obviously important to them. I was awash in jetlag, sensation and easily bewildered but was amazed nonetheless!
I have to disagree with the reviewer who said there are are only empty buildings and clocks to be seen. It's true that many treasures were carried off by the eight nation alliance in response to the boxer rebellion and others by the Nationalists in 1949.
But much is preserved in the Hall of National Treasures and even in the main and ancillary pavilions. Off the beaten path, delicate jade and crystal tree sculptures were evident. Photographs and artifacts were in many places helping me to better appreciate all I saw.
These massive wooden structures, in total the largest collection of historic ones in the world, thrilled me especially after learning they had been rebuilt hundreds of years ago after tragic fires!
Initially I confess I was a bit put off by the show of opulence, considering how many worked so hard for the luxuries of a privileged class. I thought the pre-communist Revolution of 1911 was admirable in that regular citizens threw off the Manchu yolk. But then, because the Manchu invasion beginning in 1618 took over all of China, it must seem appropriate that post Qing China includes Manchuria. And, the artistry to create such works recalls how Mozart and other European geniuses were patronized, made possible, by the very wealthy royalty to produce such art.
Politics aside, the remains of Qing and Ming China's glories are overwhelming! Foo Lions guarding stairways, marble dragon steps, iron cranes and tortoises, thresholds to step over, spirit baffles facing entryways as found in northwestern American native lodges, primitive fire suppression systems, a ""clepsydra"" or water clock, fanciful creatures on each roofline, serpentine canals, tea sets for sale at lunch confessions, the absence of beggars, charming towers, gardens, pavilions and rocks; all astonished me! the wholes impact is greater than the sum of its parts.
Bernardo Bertolucci was only one artist to film here. Jackie Chan and others have also. But Bertolucci introduced this place to me. As a film, as art, the Last Emperor's qualities can be debated. But he captured a faded era magnificently and I walked where his camera rolled! At film's end, in the Hall of Supreme Harmony, the elderly Pu Yi, after sitting in his former throne, is not seen again! And then, the museum's business day begins with tour groups and distorted sounds from portable loudspeakers and colorful pennants above tour leaders, just as I saw!
This place is revered.
In my eyes, it is so for good reason.
Yes, it's loud, crowded, commercialized and ""too much.""
It is larger than life.
See it, with open mind and eyes!"
"Yes, the palace is very impressive and a must see introduction to chinese history. I'm glad I went, but after a short while I was ready to escape. The flow of tour buses with domestic tourists is endless, and the tourists push and shove their way to peer through the windows of the various buildings. It was not easy to escape these crowds.... and this was mid-week in April. I shudder to think how crowded it is on weekends in high season.

The highlight was watching the soldiers do drills and play basketball on the plaza where you buy tickets. The second best highlight was the feeling of relief when I exited the complex and headed for the hilly temple park across the street."
"we went in late afternoon, the place was overwhelmingly packed. This is a huge place. You can now only enter from the south entrance (Tiananmen square), exit to the north. you must go through security. some parts are closed on the west side for renovation. but this place is definitely worth seeing. make sure you get the audio tour, this helps.
we didn't allow enough time and didn't get to see all the exhibits. You want to allow atleast 2 hours, probably need 4 hours to see it all."
"This is a HUGE palace that it took me a whole day including a 1/2 lunch break to fully visit every section and exhibitions. I followed the map which I bought when i was queuing up to buy ticket. The map is very important to make sure I missed out on nothing. If you love history, palace, treasures, gardens and most of all WALKING exercise, then you must visit this amazing place! All the calories I consumed was leisurely burnt there!"
We arrived at 10 am to Tiananmen Square on a Wednesday and had to wait in a lengthy security line outside in Tiananmen Square and then again before going into the Forbidden City. Once you pass these 2 security checkpoints we waited in a 15 minute line for tickets and then a 10 min security line again to enter the Forbidden city. Then we were able to enter the museum. We were staying just down the street at The Grand Hyatt so we walked over. (Prob a 1/2 mile walk?) From the hotel to entering the palace museum it took us 1 hour and 15 minutes! I have young kids so this was an unexpected amount of time to wait at the start of our day. Once inside it is of course extraordinarily busy but that is to be expected. The palace is huge and quite a sight to see. The long queues and immense security was a bit overwhelming though. So just know that going in.
"The rich history and the incredible architecture might be what draw people, but the absolutely massiveness of this ""city"" and the throngs of people honoring their history is most memorable."
"This place is huge and on a Saturday it seems like all of Beijing is there. The palace buildings are closed so you can only fight your way to a window to look at a throne inside.
The gardens are relatively peaceful but a bit of a maze, so bring a map and plan your route.
There seems to be one toilet in the whole place, use your imagination about how that one works.
Could not wait to leave, but at least I've seen the place and never have to again."
"The Forbidden City is a must visit place. We didn't have much time to spend there; but our short visit showed us that it was a most amazing place. The buildings are gorgeous and the courtyards are so large. There are some very nice museums throughout the structure; but we didn't have time to visit them. I was a bit disappoint with the dinginess of some of the halls. We couldn't go inside; but could look in to see the various thrones. Most of the halls needed a good cleaning and some maintenance to bring them up to the level of beauty they once were. The ceilings were quite dirty and many of the rooms needed interior painting. But even without that maintenance, it is a fascinating and enjoyable place to visit."
Reading some the other reviews I was a bit disappointed with my visit. But We ware with a tour group so we had limited time and all we saw was the buildings. These were impressive. My husband and I have seen quite a few Chineese films so recognised everything. Take your time here if you can and don't be put off by the number of people.
"lots of exhibits from Shang Dynasty to late Qing. A good walk to see the building structure, ancient science an also luxury life. Some of the small museums were closed but there is already enough to spend a whole afternoon there."
"This place is a must see when in Beijng. There is so much history one can learn from the visit.

And more so when you can actually see thousands of years history in reality- in the many displays & artifacts. The rich experience of seeing all the real stuff here is invaluable.

We had a knowlegeable guide who brief us throughout the whole visit.
It took few hours to finish & could be tiring though.

Bring your own water/snacks as these are expensive here. Quite normal in tourist attractions.

After this visit, our understanding is clearer & richer. Well worth the tiredness."
Entrance fee is around RMB140 less 50 percent if you have a student ID. Prepare for the long lines during weekends or holidays. Devote 4 to 5 hours here. You can get a guide or an electronic guide available in different languages. You will get a grasp of China and the Chinese people after touring the Forbidden City. Bring some water and sweets as they are more expensive inside the museum. An early morning or late afternoon visit may give you better photos.
"Spent a good half day at this free museum. Start down in the basement were the ancient china is clearly portrayed with good clear signage and english explanations. The exhibition on higher floors ""The road to rejuvenation"" is a fascinating insight into how china views its struggles and its journey to were it is now. remember to take your passport to enter"
"The forbidden city itself is a must for all travellers to Beijing.
A huge place...give it the time it deserves..it's a full day through bthe city and then out onto the nearbyy hill to look down on its splendour."
"I visited this place in may while i was in a trip to Beijing, it was worth to visit this place to feel the history of Chinese Culture. I recommend not to miss this place."
"This is a BIG place and on a nice Spring weekend a very popular attraction for PROC natives and a few westerners like myself. My recommendation is get there early...the ticket booths didn't open until 8:30 and there were hundreds if not thousands in line at that point. The scale of the place is very large, lots of walking, but make sure to take the time to wander along the sides of the complex, not just the central corridor that most seem to stick to. I'll admit that I was a bit disappointed that it didn't seem to be as well cared for as I would have expected for a major national monument and tourist destination. While it was impressive in size, with many temples and structures and a heck of a long wall, it felt a little tired and after a while many of the temples seemed nearly the same to my untrained eye. My favorite part was the garden area near the north entrance with gnarled trees, blossoming trees, interesting and varied temples and rock formations. One warning...by 10:00 AM the place was loaded with people and seemed to be building as time went on. Start early."
"I agree that if you'll only visit one place in Beijing, here it is!

The Palace is truly huge and full of history. The rooms inside the Palace may not be maintained properly or presented in a good order. Yet, just by visiting the Palace itself you could be able to understand how great / rich / cultural the Kingdom once was."
"Wow wow wow. This was truly awesome. The city within a city. You need a good tour guide and a while day to really appreciate the scale, history and sense of this Imperial Palace. Parts have been refurbished but work continues. If u are lucky and have a low smog day it makes the colours of the buildings stand out more. The intrigue of the dragon lady is worth hearing about. When u exit on the far side where the man made mountain was constructed you will see where the soil came from as you are confronted with the massive moat surrounding the city. Go in spring to see the beautiful buds of the new flowers. Go early and spend the day. Beware street hawkers outside the city along he moat street after your visit."
"The Palace Museum or the Forbidden City is a place one must visit in Beijing as it tells you how Chinese Emperors lived once upon a time. It is decidely grand in scale and takes hours to walk through. One must beware however that the tour of the Palace is a one direction flow from South to North. That is you enter at the Meridian gate in the south near Tiananmen Square and exit at the Shunwu Mun at the North. If you are dropped off at the North gate, then hard luck, you would have to walk the entire length outside the Palace wall to gain entrance in the south - and mind you that is a ""long"" walk. So be sure you approach Tiananmen for the proper and only entrance. It is difficult to say in few words how magnificient were the structures and the refined craftsmanship done decades ago - you have to appreciate them at your own pace. Other than the grand palace structures like the biggest Hall of Supreme Harmony (Taihe Dian), you will find interesting corners like the Terrace for Getting Dew, the Pavilion for Bestowing Wine, the Well where Concubine Zhen was drown by empress Cixi, the Nine Dragon Screen Wall etc etc. And do not miss out on the turrets at the four corners of the Forbidden City. You can see them on either sides of the North Gate when you exit the Palace. There is also a fee charging museum where they show some of the Palace Treasures but considering the collection which I have seen on the day of my visit, I would say that it is not something which you would miss compare with national treasures I have seen in other countries. When you exit the Forbidden City, go across the street and you will find the entrance to the Jingshan Park. Get up to the Wanchun Pavilion on top of the hill (more than 200 steps) and you will be rewarded with a panoramic view of the entire Forbidden City as well as other parts of the City of Beijing."
"I don't bandy the word around lightly - awesome it is. Despite being busy, it's massive scale means you rarely feel jostled (apart from when peering in the palace doors). We were there several hours and only scraped the surface."
"The one ""must see"" attraction of Beijing. Full of history, culture, architecture, and beauty. Lots of buildings and exhibits to appreciate. Never disappoints!"
"The place is HUGE and even on a weekday over crowded ( by Chinese standards)
I would not suggest any traveler to attempt it on a weekend or a holiday as most visitors are Chinese and not westerners.

The spectacle is beautiful and a must see. The interiors of the building are not much to see and can be avoided. The only place worth visiting was the hall of watches / clocks if you like to see some unique time pieces.

The hall of jewels was a let down. I have seen better jewelry in small town museums in India.
On enquiry I realized why , as 3700 boxes of jewelry were taken away to Taiwan.

If you go there , be prepared for uneven stone paths, dirty toilets, warm beverages (which are supposed to be cold) building with no wheel chair access.

If you are not an enthusiast you can be in and out in under 2 hours."
"Have dreamt of this visit after reading the history and tbh watching The Last Emperor movie decades ago and loved every minute.
The sheer size of the place and the architecture are stunning. It was incredibly busy but it's so easy to walk away from the crowds and find yourself alone.
The interior buildings aren't accessible so you're really just walking through the grounds but it still is very impressive.
Like everywhere else in Beijing it seems you're constant prey for the scam merchants. Take your own refreshments as they'll rip you off in here and ignore the dozens of rickshaw drivers at the rear exit as it's not too far away walk to the subway or back to town."
"The Forbidden City, or Palace Museum, really inspires awe, in the original sense of the word. It is simply mind-boggling. Huge, well-preserved, beautifully maintained, in a pristine condition despite the crowds. Yes, there are many people. But the complex is so huge that there are quiet spots, where you can relax almost on your own. I visited on a Friday in spring, arriving at the ticket office 15 minutes before opening time. There was already a queue of about 25 people in front of me, but when 15 tickets boots opened at 8.30, I bought my ticket after only about 7 more minutes. Very efficient system. The audio tour at RMB 40 is worth it: a calm female voice explains the different sights, and the experience of visiting is definitely enhanced by the information. I spent three hours there, then the crowds got a bit much. Definitely a must-see and a once in a lifetime experience."
"Also known as Forbidden City, the tour may take about half to one full day to explore this whole vast complex. We start our tour from the Tiannanmen Square and into the Meridian Gate. There are several quarters inside the palace which you may be lost during wandering there."
"Trying to go in to the forbidden city was one of the most exhausting things. The taxi driver took me to the back of the forbidden city, I didn't know it was the exit and there are hundreds of people just screaming at you, I did not know what they want. Finally I caught a ""taxi"" he asked for 80 CNY to take me around, I just said yes cause I was just so tired. It costed me only 40 CNY to get there from my hotel.
But as soon as I went inside, it all seemed worth it. It was beautiful."
"Palace, Gates, Guards and everything is unique over there. Enjoy the history and architecture of the area. Beautiful statue of Dragon Turtle."
"Okay - this site has some warts. First of all, it's quite large, so be prepared to walk a couple of miles from start to finish. Next, it's quite crowded - about 20,000 visitors on an average day I was told. Finally, you have to run the gauntlet of folks trying to sell you things before and after the site.

With that said, the Forbidden Palace is absolutely a must-visit. Ironically, the day before our visit I saw an article on CNN that listed the top ten visited palaces and castles in the world. The Forbidden Palace was #1 on the list, which included places like the Summer Palace in St. Petersburg and the Louvre in Paris (former Palace itself).

Do this with a guide to make sense of the site. It is reported to have 9,999 rooms (9 is a lucky number in China). The palace was the site of the last 600 years of the Chinese Dynasties, which ended in 1911 (although the last emperor was allowed to live on site until 1924).

Best of all, it's in the heart of Beijing and just a short ride away from any reasonably located hotel."
A must visit in Beijing the palace museum is otherwise known as the forbidden city. Too much inside to explain in detail- get a guide or good guide book. Entrance opposite north entrance to tianamen square. Wear comfortable shoes this place us huge. Various food outlets inside and toilets. Allow time for the gardens at the northern most point- the exit
"Visiting the Forbidden Palace was my childhood dream, and last autumn (2014) I eventually realized this when I had a short stay in Beijing.
It was a weekday but there were a sea of people there. However, this was not a big problem.
Did a lot of walking but it was worth it! I planned to explore every small palace in the inner harem but was able to enter only some with others being closed for restoration.
The Qing architecture is fantastic. Will definitely visit it again in the future."
"Have seen many dramas that feature this forbidden palace, so it is a must visit to this palace museum during your stay in Beijing. The place is so huge that you can actually visit the place the whole day by slowing walking around. During the time i visit this place the museum actually have some buildings doing some renovation, thus unable to enter to take a look, a bit wasted though. The place will always be full of tourists and super crowded, recommended to start from Tian An Men side and walk till the end and from there you can take bus to the clock tower and drum tower."
"Of course you have to visit, but there's so much more great things to spend time on in Beijing. Present checks, ""1 million"" hustlers that wants to sell ""everything"" (makes this worse than the ""old"" - it's much better now - Silk Market) and the crowds of hang around people has made the visit a much less attractive place."
"I had a private guide tour of the Palace. It was very crowded and cannot imagine being there during the highest of tour season. My guide, Alvin Benton, did a fabulous job of providing me with enough information without being too overwhelming. Alvin said he could spend 7 hours there (we ended up being there about 3). The history behind the palace is long and interesting. It is not a palace as in the western sense, but definitely worth a visit. Make sure to check out the details on the roofs."
Forbiden City is amazing but with all the people around it's difficult to see all. You can't enter any palace. there aren't many places to rest.
"You need to visit this place for a couple of days to see it all. It really transports you back and you feel you are among the emperors. Stunning architecture, this is really an amazing experience but can get very busy. Go on a wet day! The place is much bigger than you think. Good luck and enjoy"
"We visited here in early November 2013. We had booked a private English-speaking guide and driver package through Indochina Travel which included 2 full days in Beijing, a day in Xian, entrance fees, lunches and very good personal service. One of the first attractions we visited on our first day was The Palace Museum (Forbidden City). This is set on a huge site and houses China's largest and best preserved cluster of ancient buildings. It shows the order and sophistication of the life and power of the emperors during the years they lived in this enclave. You pass from one gate into areas where the buildings can be looked into, then through another gate and so on, each time the buildings becoming more important and sacred. It would help if you could download a map of the grounds from a website such as Wikipedia showing the different buildings in relation to the whole site as we did not have this and just kept moving on and on through gates and looking into buildings not remembering the names and importance of them. I have since found a map of the grounds (Wikipedia) and can now identify what the buildings and gates in my photos are of. Don't be surprised at the number of people all trying to look into the temples. You will need to be a bit pushy to get to the opening otherwise you will not get to see inside. No-one will stand back to let you in. As we wanted to buy a book on the site, our guide would not let us buy from inside the grounds. He said that the same book was available outside and could be bought cheaper. He negotiated this for us. Just watch out though that you receive your change in 20 or 10 yen notes as counterfeit notes for 50 or 100 yen are common. The person our guide purchased the book from handed over a counterfeit note and our guide picked this up immediately, handed it back and asked for 20 yen notes. He explained that even notes drawn from an ATM can be counterfeit. He said the biggest give away is the slightly thicker paper. The thread through the notes is not always in the same place so this does not necessarily indicate that the money is fake. Was really impressed with the huge grounds and the moat around the site was shrouded in smog but gave a wonderfully ethereal look to our photos. Really amazing!"
"This is the main attraction in Beijing, so you've got to go there to see what it is and to learn all the history behind.
From our understanding, the emperors that lived there had a life to make any king jealous.
There are more buildings than you can count.
Each emperor had 72 wives but there is no word about 72 mothers-in-law (maybe that's why they call it ""forbidden city"" - I guess they were not allowed in).
All other men inside the city were castrated to prevent temptation (and for sure competition).
All this huge complex was there just to please one single person, the emperor.
Enough about history.
To get into the main part of the city (the palace museum) you will have to pay an entrance fee (less than US$10).
There are places selling food as well as souvenirs.
You should wear comfortable shoes since the place is simply huge.
Most of the main buildings just have an altar that you can only see from the outside but you have to fight for a good spot with the locals that will simply jump in front of you without excusing themselves.
Once you exit at the back you should turn left and come back to the front through the park besides, which has the best views."
"The Palace Museum is the centre of the historical sector of Beijing. My son & I stayed in an interesting traditional hotel 5 minutes walk from the Palace and the walk to get to the entrance was past delicious hole in the wall ""take aways"" where we chose our breakfast and ate on the sidewalk. Arriving at the start of the walk through the Palace one is amazed by the number of people and they keep coming in waves. To enjoy this experience do yourself a favour and arrive early and be amounts the 1st to get going as tour groups and the sheer volume of people going through this attraction is mind boggling. It is hard to describe the beauty of the Palace so I offer you a pictorial experience in my BLOG - http:/hennopsrover.blogspot.com. We were there on Saturday 14th March 2015, just the other day!!!!!"
"The Forbidden City/Palace Museum showcases the ancient Chinese Architecture in great detail from wood layered structures with no nails, paintings, curvings and detailed items of of wood, steel, porcelain, etc. the city has a meridian from east to west, 1st gate to last gate. The city depicts the the day to day life of the emperors and is an amazing experience and a must do in Beijing. The best time to go is in winter when there are few tourists, wear comfortable walking shoes as it is set in a huge acreage in the city."
Don't miss this during your visit to Beijing.Bang next to Tienmann square the museum showcases the palace where the emperor lived.Don't miss the house of clocks which is very unique at a nominal extra 10 RMB
"This is an amazing sight, it has only been open to the public since 1929 and was forbidden to enter since 1420. An incredible array of palaces that the emperor used and a very large area to visit."
"Like the Great Wall, Forbidden City is a “must-see” in Beijing because of its historical value and significance. But be prepared – the visit can be a bit frustrating.

I’ve been there several times – on work days and holidays, in summer as well as winter. The place was either very crowded or extremely crowded. Last Dec, I brought my family there. We entered via Tiananmen Square. Just to past the security gate leading to Tiananmen Square, we waited in line for nearly an hour.

Luckily, the Forbidden City is huge. Once inside, we didn’t feel so jammed. But major points of interests and displays were invariably swarmed with people. The noise and the pushing made it a bit hard to savior the moment.

The good part is, there really are a lot to see – the architectures, the gardens, the exhibits, etc. We stayed away from the “big attractions” and managed to find a few quiet corners to slowly enjoy ourselves. We spent the whole morning there but still only had just a glimpse of it.

The sheer size of the complex would command at least half a day to have a quick tour. This whole place is actually filled with stories. It could easily take a full day if you have a guide to show you around everything. Either way, just go. It may not be a visit that makes your day but you can then proudly say, “I’ve seen it.”"
I think the Forbidden city is a must see in Beijing but the crowds were large even in the off season. The tour groups were large and very pushy. It was difficult to see in most of the buildings because people were pushing and shoving. Still I think it was worth half a day to see how the emperors lived.
"This palace is huge. The amount of tourist took away from the experience but it is still worth a trip. Make sure and wear very comfortable shoes and don't bother in winter. I went during the week and it was crowded with tourist, mainly from other parts of China. I say this because be prepared for them to pay more attention to you than to the Palace through pictures and video. I can't imagine at the weekend the amount of people so I say go during the weekend go with a tour guide for better understanding of the history of the palace."
"The place is huge! A lot of people. Take a lot of pictures. It would take a lot of time to see every building, but try your best and see the main ones, check with the tourists info and go for them first."
"We visited on our own and found that when you reach the East Gate entrance (exit only), you have to walk left around the outside to get to the main entrance. Even when you get there, you have to walk further left to queue at the main ticket office, get the tickets and then go back to the main entrance. Once inside, you walk right through to the other end and then either exit there or come back to the East Gate exit. There is a lot of walking involved, lots of steps and plenty of cobbles. For those with walking limitations this could be a challenge. Mostly the rooms are largely empty with most items now in museums although there are a few items on display if you can get to peer inside. We went off season, I hate to think how crowded it will be starting next month. It is a place to see but largely to stroll through. There are few signs in English but there are plenty of photo opportunities. There is a little bus from the East Gate to the Main Entrance but the queues seemed quite long so it was quicker to walk."
"This place is worth a visit if you have a guide telling you the history of the family that have stayed there or other history facts.

I felt the audio guide just describe how the palace is built or what it's made out off or how much wood they use. I think they could have taken a better approach having a narrative of the place. Also the audio guide has a different audio socket so you cannot use your own headphones. The headphones they provided is very uncomfortable. Also the audioguide auto plays depending on your location which can be annoying at times.

Also when the forbidden palace is featured on videos or poster card it shows how well maintain the place is. When I visited the place was very dusty. The paints were coming off. Most of the decorations on the buildings were chipped off.

I didn't like how I have to pay extra to see the treasury gallery.

You are not allowed to exit at the entrance of the palace. And at the exit the subway is not convenient located. You can take bus 2 and it's about 15 rmb where it can take you to the entrance or stay for 5 stops to wulumqu for food/shop place."
"These tour guides as soon as they see you are a foreigner try to get you, they asked me 200 yuan per person and offer me to avoid the ""huge"" line to buy the entrance ticket, since, I almost accept because of my daughter and wife convenience, but then I stare that actually was no line in front of the many ticket windows that only cost me 40 or so with my student card, and also at the main gate I get a recorded guidance device for only 50 yuan, that was activated automatically by location sensors and came in almost 8 or 9 languages.

The place was big enough to hang around for 4 or 5 hours, and souvenirs shop was inexpensive and saves the issue to go to pearl market for them, by the way that pearl market is anything but a good choice for shopping.

You can get much more for less money at a regular mall."
"Great place to take the family and explore. You have to pay extra to visit the clock museum, but well worth it."
The Palace Museum or Forbidden City is an absolute must see. It is enormous so allow lots of time to wander down side alleys and into all the concubine apartments and side museums once you have enjoyed the majesty of the main pavilions.
Only place in China that wasn't destroyed by the cultural revolution. Amazing history and art. A must see for any traveler to Beijing.
"The Forbidden City (Y40/pp) was our LEAST DESIRABLE venue in Beijing, and very difficult to appreciate with the multitude of LARGE tourist groups, each with their banner-waving guide with a loudspeaker strapped to their chest, and their groups of tourists with wacky, colored caps. From buying the entrance ticket to the pushing/shoving experienced with getting views/photos inside buildings, the historical significance gets lost in the stress . To make matters worse, upon exiting the Forbidden City, you’ll also have to run the gauntlet of very pushy souvenir vendors lined up in both exit directions on the sidewalks – UGHH !! Unfortunately, our visit to the Forbidden City did not turn out to be as enjoyable as we had hoped."
"This was one of our must see places. We were surprised how big it was, you know intellectually but to be there WOW!!! If you only see one thing in Beijing it has to be this, make sure you leave yourself plenty of time at least 3/4 hours to get the best out of it."
This should be on your list of to do's while in Beijing. May sure you wear you good pair of walking shoes.
"It'll be hard to avoid this attraction as it's considered a world heritage site and a ""must-see"" attraction. Keep in mind that it gained this status on cultural/historical reasons. If someone had built this in 1980, you'd have to pay people to come see it.

As you can already gather, I was rather disappointed. The first few halls are impressively large but the rest of the park is simply a copy-paste of the same building, pavillion and hallway. I suppose if you were really into ceramics and other relics you could lose yourself in here for the day.

If you have a limited time in Beijing (<3 days), I'd focus on the great wall, lama temple and temple of heaven. And if you do visit the forbiden city, do yourself a favour and DO NOT miss jingshan park which is just across the street after you exit the city from the north gate. The views from the top are breathtaking."
"This whole site was just fantastic. Be ready for plenty of walking, big crowds and many steps but you will not remember this only the great site. We had a guide that was a great advantage as she took us directly to the major sites and the hidden gems. Can's say a bad thing about this site, just go!!"
the Palace Museum is the new name for the forbidden city which will take a whole day if you plan to tinker each nook and cranny of the 9999 rooms. I recommend that you segregate half a day and include Tianamen Square and end the day at Jishan Park there is a great view of the forbidden city there.
"I really think we have to visit this place as we get to Beijing, but be prepared to walk a lot and not to get as excited as you thought you would be. Anyway, after visiting such a place, we feel as we are really part of the planet, for this is unique!"
Theren is plenty written about the palace museum/forbidden city so I will just add that it is best to avoid weekends and make sure you don't visit during Chinese public holidays. The place is still going to be crowded during weekdays but at least it is not going to be shoulder-to-shoulder.
"Visited on a Sunday!
Extremely crowded but worth it!

Tips:
Start early at Tiananmen Square, prepare to be shoved and pushed going through the security line.
Cross the road to the palace museum, forbidden city; the long lines for tickets and security move along fine.
Read up prior to visiting, and take your time walking through, will not feel the need of a guide or tour.
Accept that people will be in all your pictures.
Wear comfortable shoes, place is huge; bring water, some food available inside.
Entrance is from south, exit from north gate; upon exiting, cross the road to Jingshan park, great view of forbidden city from top.

Important: Around the entire outside area, ignore anybody who comes up to you, offering guide/tour/transportation/other services or politely wants to 'help'; just keep walking!"
"The last time, I visited Beijing, it was closed for 'renos'. But this time round, I managed to get in. Please bring your passports as they are very strict and without one, they will it allow entery.
It is very huge, four floors of China's history, but, I felt like it was a propaganda place for the locals.Mostly, about the acheivements of the ruling party. I was disappointed as I was really wanting to look at the history of the Ming and Qing Dynasties. They have very superficial notes or writting on those two dynasties."
"A Quick visit to the Forbidden Palace on the first day of 2015 during a day tour with my guide Terry was a sight I won’t forget quickly. This place is awe-inspiring, the grand design of it all to the smallest carvings on a handrail. There is so much to see, the place is huge from the moment of looking at the Palace from Tiananmen Square across the road, a large road that separates Tiananmen Square and the Forbidden Palace, to walking through the first huge red door under the massive picture of Chairman Mao. I know easily I could have spent a lot more time in there looking at all the buildings with intricate paintings that adorned nearly every surface, also covered with little and large sculptures, to the sculptures that are throughout the whole site, tree’s that are 500 years old and trees even older than that, amazing gardens and rock features, even just the tiles on the roofs of each building were fascinating to look at. There are signs on a lot of the buildings and relics that describe to you what they are as well, even having Terry my tour guide giving me great and fluent English information about everything I was seeing, reading the signs as well helped to immerse me in the enormity and beauty of this site and of China in general. Yes there were a lot of people and this was in the off season as well but when it comes to certain tourist hotspots in the world you have to expect this. Having a good guide helped, as I think it would be easy to get lost within the walls as there are just so many fascinating things to look at. In general I agree that this is certainly a point of destination to see when checking out China."
"If you are visiting Beijing, it will never be complete if you have never been to the Palace Museum. You have to be here to get the actual feel of how lavish it was (even more so if it is well maintained). It's a huge area so expect to walk a lot. Also, since everyone is going to the forbidden city, both locals and foreigners, be prepared for the crowd...everywhere!

As with other places, each pavilions/buildings/structures has its own meaning and functions. If you are not familiar with the history, everything might seem to be repetitive. You may want to choose which are the places you wanted to visit beforehand because one day is not enough. But it is still a great place to visit.

Remember to check the weather forecast. Do bring umbrella if showers are expected as there are a lot of unsheltered paths."
"This is a a must-see, obviously, but it won't knock your socks off with its splendour. It's beauty is in the little thing: it's size, it's symmetry, it's history. Despite it's size, I don't think you do yourself any favours by spending a LOT of time here. Everything looks the same and you will probably have the same experience after spending two hours here that you would after spending 4+. Do a walk through and move on to something else. If you insist on being thorough, then I would recommend doing it in two sittings, because honestly after a while you will just start skipping over things anyway."
"This also known as the Forbidden City and here you must stay at least one day, then you will see ca 50%. Reccomenden is to use 2 days in here. Be aware almost no food to buy there and very few toilets"
"The forbidden city is surrounded by a river, the place is vast ,must see if in Beijing.One will spend at least two hours just walking from the front entrance to the back exit.Entrance about $6"
"The Forbidden City is huge and even though we spent all day there we didn't see everything. We bought the audio guide and it was good enough for us. If you only have a limited amount of time, pre-plan which buildings or places you want to see and view them first, otherwise you may run out of time. Certain parts of the Forbidden City close an hour before closing time."
"I've visited the Palace Museum (aka The Forbidden City) several times since first visiting Beijing in 1996, and it truly rates as one of those attractions where the 'wow factor' is just as good as what you expect. In a single visit you'll be able to get through all of the main pavilions, but it's a huge site so will take a few visits to really see the place properly. The downside is that you visit on a nice blue-sky day with perfect weather, half of Beijing will be there with you! But still a 'must see' while in Beijing."
"This site is known by most as 'The Forbidden City'. It is usually done as part of a day tour with the Summer Palace, Temple of Heaven and Tiananmen Square. Tiananmen Square is located right in front of the main entrance gate to the Forbidden City. This place is always crowded and especially so on holidays. There is very little inside of the buildings to see as most of the buildings you are allowed to walk through were originally reception rooms for visiting dignitaries to meet the Emperor (so only he had a chair to sit - all others stood). The site is immense, covering about 180 acres. Just walking through the 'city' is impressive - for it's size, it's architecture, it's history ... The 'City' itself is a series of courtyards, flanked by administrative buildings and enclosed at the front and back of each courtyard with grander reception rooms/buildings. The flow of the crowd is always in the same direction (only one entrance and exit to the 'City'), so even with the crowds, things move along."
"Also one of the must see while in Beijing - even though it is not too much to see. All the buildings look the same and the walk through the whole ""city"" takes less then an hour...and still there was nothing that mesmerized me/us. The buildings are beautiful in its own ways, the environment of the ""city"" is spectacular - but one sight and you have seen it alls - basically.

* As always in China - BRING TOILET PAPER!!"
"I visited The Palace Museum (aka the Forbidden City) on my last day in Beijing. Maybe because I had already had enough of the tourist crowds or because I had also visited the Summer Palace before, but the Palace Museum really didn't win me over. Don't get me wrong, the sheer size of the city (and a CITY it really is!) and the monumental aspects of Chinese history it has seen are awe-inspiring. However, even though the complex is so large, it still felt like it was really really crowded. There were tour groups everywhere, each one with a leader screaming into a microphone and a parade of drones following behind. Most of the interesting displays (the throne room, for instance, or most of the small jewelry displays in the treasury rooms) were completely inaccessible because of the crowds of people being shuffled past them with their tours.

It would have been more interesting perhaps to have had a lot of time with a guide pointing out the meaning behind certain aspects of the city and its history, but I didn't have enough time to think a guide justified. Still, if you have more than a few days in Beijing, it is worth seeing. Try to go on a weekday, and NOT during a Chinese holiday. Be sure to wear comfortable shoes, as you'll be doing a lot of walking. Also, don't forget to check out the view over the Forbidden City from the hill in the park to the north of the Palace Museum!"
"many different museums, porcelan, jewelry, take a good map at the entrance, it will help you don't miss anything"
"If you didn't know, the Palace Museum IS the Forbidden City.

For starters this locations was PACKED Chinese New Years Day. When you get off of the subway (or any transport) you will have to go through a security check in to get to the city. People are constantly pushing and cutting. Have your Passport ready because in some lines they check for ID. Also if you have a largish bag or a stroller, there is a certain line you have to go down. (Found out the hard way).

Once through security you still need to enter the front plaza ro get your tickets. The lines were insane even before the vendors opened. We got lucky, we walked all the way to the last line and got in line. Thats when I noticed the small line of two more vendors next to us. I went to investigate. The window said audio only. However, they were selling normal tickets like everyone else (possibly due to the crowding) so I managed to squeak by the line. When in doubt, explore, because their is a huge line/mob mentality in China. People will just be in line because it is there and not think that their might be a better option.' If that line is short is must be for something else'.

The crowds mainly traveled down the center (where all the rooms are that you can look into but not go into.) There is alot of pushing and jostling to get a peek in. However, the rooms are very dark and hard to see much detail in anyway. Many of the artifacts are similar tot hat of the Summer Palace and Lama temple, which are places you can actually go into as well. So if your not keen of fighting for a glimpse in a dark room, skip it, The crowds are less if you take the wheel chair ramps to the sides (though they are still cobblestone so a bumpy ride).

There are plenty of bathrooms and souvenir shops located in the city, decent food is harder to come by but their are snack vendors available.

The best part of the whole city is The imperial garden at the very back (I do believe it is a one-way trip but I could be wrong). There are interesting trees and rock formations, much more unique that the architecture and antiques.

The exit spits you out right in front of the Jingshan? Park which is another temple you can enter. While their are little to no maps guiding you in the forbidden city, outside the forbidden city, the maps are much easier to find and read and they will direct you to the subway or the snack street (wafuxching) for some exotic grub."
"Buildings are maintained however there is always room for improvement. Toilets are surprisingly clean too, not much litter as well. Wear good walking shoe as this is not your usual museum it is the forbidden city you know?! 😄✌️"
"So I've visited Gu Gong/Forbidden City way back in 1998, Dec 2008 and again in Aug 2011 while living in the wonderful international city of Beijing, China's proud capital. It is better to visit here in the spring(Late Mar to Mid May) or autumn(Early Sep to Early Nov) because it is TOO COLD IN THE WINTER AND WAY TOO HOT AND HUMID IN THE SUMMER! Here there are many gates of heaven which represent the hierarchy of the Chinese Empire during the Ming, the Qing, and so forth. You can visit the souvenir shops inside the palace as well, hopefully is helpful."
Would be nice to hear stories. But we were in a hurry so we did not get the chance to join any history tour.
"Apparently this is the one attraction to see in Beijing... dont get me wrong it was very impressive but for me it was just too crowded and too much concrete with nothing much else to see... if you like museums or architecture then this is the place to go, if you like parks i think the Summer Palace is much better."
"This was a beautiful walk and the weather was decent for it being February. We did have the great misfortune of coming on Chinese New Year's Eve, so the place was packed!

I would like to return when I have more time to wander and sit to take in the sights."
"The Palace Museum or the Forbidden City is mostly the first place you must visit if you're in Beijing.

TOP TIP: Bear in mind that the Palace is HUGE, crowded, and hot (depending on when you visit), so firstly wear comfortable footwear, avoid carrying heavy handbags and carry some refreshments if you want to comfortably last through the entire tour.

GUIDE: There is an audio guide in English as an extra cost and it does its job reasonably well. However, even though its good, it can get a little monotonous. Hire a guide if you wish for an interactive tour. We did not because we were pissed off with the amount of guides approaching and harassing us before we entered!

BEWARE: Before you enter you will be approached to the extent of being harassed by various guides. Some will go to the extent of telling you that it is impossible to enter the Palace without a guide or that the Palace does not allow visitors without a guide or that you will have to pay extra to enter without a guide or that you will have to wait for 3 hours in the queue-DO NOT BELIEVE ANY OF THEM. We were told all the above things, we chose to buy a ticket ourselves which we got within 5 minutes of standing in the queue and we opted for the audio tour.

IMPATIENT TRAVELERS: For the people who do not wish to see every nook and corner of the Palace, read up before hand and chose exactly what you wish to see. It is almost impossible to see every part in a day.

NOT LAVISH: Please do not go with expectations of the Palace and living quarters being lavish like the European palaces. Even the living quarters of the emperor looked pretty basic. Its very different in its own way.

JINGSHAN PARK: After you exit the Forbidden City, cross the road and enter the Jingshan Park. Make the effort and walk up to the topmost point of the artificial hill created there. You will see the most stunning view of the Forbidden City! Not to be missed!"
Just a fabulous place to wander around and take in the sights. I visited on several occasions on clear sunny days. A peaceful and friendly place to take in on an afternoon.
"WE walked the entire length of the ground.
Fabulous buildings and grounds. Just unbelievable around every corner was another WOW view and glimpse of History."
This is an amazing site. The size is impressive and you really need to see it with a guide who can give you insight into the different parts of the palace museum
If you thought bukhingham palace was big think again how about another 12 of them for size. This place is so huge it's no wonder they call it the forbidden city. The minute you step in you see the huge classical Chinese architecture. 6 huge palaces that cover such a huge area with smaller buildings to the side. It's definetly not one to miss while visiting beijing.
"don't let the boring entrance put you off, if you want a view of China its found inside. spend an hour or two it will help you contexulise your China exprience"
"Interesting place, make sure you spend sometime visiting galley ways other than the main temples.

Audio guide is helpful if you want to know the interesting facts about the forbidden palace but the English guide is not with the money as they often just recite the facts of what are said in the audio book

The hill (xiangshan) at the back of the forbidden palace offer a fantastic view of the forbidden city and it's only a 15-30min climb. Worth it for sure.

Avoid any major Chinese holiday as you can and otherwise you will be lost in a sea of crowds (if that's what interests you, forget what I just said).

Hot summer days should be avoided as well because there is not a lot of shades and you would probably want your visit to be over as soon as possible."
"It´s just what you would expect from what the forbidden city was going to be, of course it has lost the grandioseness it must have had at its times of splendor and sometimes you feel every chamber looks just like the last one, but it´s still a great place, you can take great pictures and if you get the audio guide it gets way better!"
Was ok. A lot of walking is squares and just buildings etc to see. Hiring a guide made it better...gettkng scammed leaving made it a bit worse..but still an experience
Having a guide made the experience that much better. She told us many stories and historical events that took place here. Just breathtaking and absolutely interesting!
"Amazing layout and certainly a must see in Beijing.
The symmetry of design is striking and the painstaking detail is truly art.
Another great feat of human endeavour.
Beware of tour guides offering unsolicited services."
"While waiting for the main gate to open, we were fortunate in accepting an offer from a local certified guide to give us a tour of the Palace Museum for $30. He was extremely knowledgable and spoke English very well. Also, he got us to the front of any lineups during the tour.

There is so much history and are so many little details that we never would have known about otherwise. He spent the better part of the day with us, taking us to Tiananmen Square as well, which is directly across the street to the south, and then to the Summer Palace. From there, he took us to the ""secret store"", which one would never find on their own. There, you can find all the knock-offs that the Chinese are so famous for. Rolex, Gucci, etc...

And, to end it, he brought us to the ""China Academy of Traditional Chinese Medicine"", where we were ""examined"" and advised by their head professor, while receiving foot massages from two students.

At the end of the day, he even provided us with discounted tickets for an acrobatic show we wanted to see that evening."
It was amazing bit expierience for me. This complex is soooooo huge it has more than 9000 rooms and is an architecture pearl. I spend there couple hours walking throught this labirynt. The entrance cost 40RMB which is not much for what you will see there. Of cours as the object is something really important in Beijing you will have a lot of turist there no matter which seasonyou will go there but this is a small disadventages:).
This was also on my bucket list and I was not disappointed. There isn't enough space here to describe everything you see on this tour. There are many buildings to see inside and out. This is an all day event and you still probably won't see it all. The building architecture is impressive. The statues so beautiful and ornate. Don't even think about missing this attraction.
"Having heard so much about this place, I was ready to be disappointed but, no...the Forbidden City is amazingly huge, complex, and many layered. Use the audio guides for a fraction of what a personal guide would charge, and much more informative. One caution would be to avoid going on a Saturday morning (like me) when everyone else will be queueing up for a ticket. Also: be very wary of strangers (often couples) approaching under the pretext of practicing English, which then evolves to an invitation for tea in a local establishment. My portion of bill came to $250 (good tea, but not that good, and the locale was non-descript, formica tables, paper napkins), obviously working with proprietor. Signed check: ""Scam"", and credit card company refused to pay...but still a hassle to sort out."
"I was very lucky to experience the Forbidden City on a clear, sunny, smog-less day. The ancient buildings looked lovely in the sun with their intricate colorful patterns at the base of each rooftop.
We took an hour-long walking tour with an English-speaking guide (named Laura) from a booth within the complex itself, near the recorded tours -- and that really made our visit.
Laura was well prepared, very fluent and eager to share her knowledge of the area with us.
It was interesting and educational, and I'd definitely recommend it.
For those who are wondering, there's a large picture of Chairman Mao on the outside but none on the inside, where it's all about imperial times.
The gift shops accept credit cards."
"The Forbidden City was FAR larger than we had thought it would be! Leave yourself about 2 hours to walk through, more if you want to linger a bit.

The crowds made it difficult to get really good photos, as there are people in every shot. The Chinese got a real kick out of us Americans and Europeans - several of us were asked for photos with the locals. :) The crowd was about 99% chinese.

There is a small entrance fee to the site.

Note that you enter at the south entrance, and exit at the north - you do not come out where you went in.

The courtyards within the city are enormous and impressive. The buildings beautiful, and signs explaining the purpose and date built are translated into English.

However, most all of the buildings do not allow entrance - you can only peer into the buildings. This wouldn't be too bad, but there's no artificial lighting inside, so they're pretty dark and it's hard to see. WIth the crowds, it was difficult to get a view at the doors.

Overall, you must see this sight, as it's like going to NYC without seeing the Statue of Liberty or Empire State building, and it was beautiful. Just don't expect there to be enough to see for more than a couple of hours."
"You enter from Tiananmen Square, and it is 40rmb per person.

Obviously you will visit here as its iconic and worthy of numerous photos. It gives a wow factor when you enter but on the whole I found it to be a little disappointing, and the so-called temples or halls were simply decorated by putting a chair or throne in there to keep the crowds content.

A decent walk and a few good views but it needs some work done. Not worth 40rmb and it only took us an hour to ge through, where as the National Museum took 3hrs or so and was free."
"This is one of those sights you MUST visit in Beijing. It is huge and takes many hours to take in all the history. Bypass the tour guides if you want to spend more time and read the info boards all the way through, in English as well as Mandarin."
"Without a doubt, the Forbidden City is on everyone's must see list on their visit to Beijing. It's a great way to get a feel of how life behind the closed walls used to be. The scale of the grounds is quite a feat to see, but because we weren't allowed inside most of the buildings it got repetitive after a while. The beginning area of the Palace has been restored to its former glory, but as you get to the end you see how dilapidated it has become. The Emperor's living quarters in the inner-chamber was interesting to see. Despite the vastness of the entire Forbidden City, the quarters were so tiny and cramped in comparison (not to mention super crowded as you fight arm space from large mainland tour groups). These structures were all shut-in so you could only look through the dirty glass full of fingerprints. If you have ever visited the National Palace Museum in Taipei before visiting The Forbidden City, you might be underwhelmed like I was because there were hardly much relics left (as most are in Taipei and you can get a much closer view).

The Forbidden City does have a Clock and Treasure gallery for 10 CNY ($1.60 usd) extra each that you can visit but we didn't have time to see it. We went on a day that was considered slow (in mid-September) with a private guide because our friends previously fell victim to friendly people that wanted to practice ""English"" (look up ""tea scam""). If you wanted to tour it alone, there are self-audio guides available in many languages other than Chinese for 60 CNY ($9.6 usd--see photo for comprehensive language list).

The grounds were advertised to close at 5 pm (April - Oct) but the guards chased us out way before then. We were told by our guide it was because they wanted to go home early because many have seen sightings of the Emperor's concubines at night fall. Don't forget it's closed on Mondays (except in July/ August). If you have a chance and the energy, you must visit Jingshan park-- right across from the Forbidden City exit to take in the vastness of the grounds from a bird's-eye view. It's a hike, but totally worth it. It's super cheap too (2 CNY /5 CNY during summer time)!"
"This is a must see. However, be prepared to walk! The area it covers is vast, but worth every step. Not too busy in the winter which made the experience very enjoyable."
"Impressive, surprises, and a nice shooting place. It was so impress with the old day of China. However it is so crowded. Suggest travel on winter will be better."
"One cannot escape visitng this huge open air museum. It is probably restaured a bit too much, i.e. you do not really feel it is as old as it actually is. Be prepared to walk for quite a few hours."
Right in the middle of Beijing lies the Ming Dynasty's jeweled city once reserved only for the Emperor's family ..it's s colorful look into the past!
"This is vast. Took 6 hours walking around & still lots more to see. Make sure you pay to get into the Clocks museum. It was worth a visit. The jewels have gone to Taipei & not worth visiting it here. There's a restaurant near the entrance & nothing else after. Bring enough water if you are visiting here. Entrance is RMB40 a pax, tickets for clock museum RMB10 each, same price to see the jewels."
"Not much to say.. It is just stunningly beautiful! Make sure you go early, it closes at 1530 (or 1600 in summer)"
"The size alone will overwhelm you, we took a walking tour we booked through Viator tours, our guide met us at the hotel and then we took public transportation to get to the sites we wanted to visit, this way you can control where you go and how much time your want to spend. The ""Forbidden City"" has so much history to explore. While visiting take some time to walk Tiananmen Square, which is directly in front of the palace."
"If you only have a day in Beijing, the Palace Museum is somewhere I would highly recommend. This is the place that represents ancient China and from the architecture to the history of it is simply spectacular! I'd recommend buying a ticket in advance so as to save the hassle queuing up."
"It will blow you away! We entered from south gate and exited from north gate. We walked for like three hours exploring all the buildings and their history. Please take time have a guide and learn about each and every building and its purpose. It was so much more than what I expected and i am going there again, hopefully soon."
"During winter, the Palace Museum is CLOSED on MONDAYS (except on Puplic Holidays). Also important to note: Once you got inside the area of the Forbidden City, you cannot leave the place the same way you entered it; you have to either walk through it until you reach the North Gate (when entering from the South Gate) or leave through the East or West Gate.

Nevertheless, the Palace Museum is definitely a MUST when in Beijing. The area is huge and there is much to see and to explore. However, the large amount of tourists can be annoying. Therefore, try to stroll around avoiding places with too many tourists if possible.
If you go there during winter time, be prepared to wear many layers of clothes as there is no heating and it is windy all the time. If you consider that, you will have an amazing experience visiting the Palace Museum :)"
"Forbidden City is in my opinion the most important place to be in Beijing. The complex is magnificent, visiting all those gates, palaces, square, which are built in very traditional chinese style, really give you an impression, that you are in different world, especially if you are like me european!
The ticket costs 40RMB (around 6-7$). There is a lot of local private guides, who offer their service just for 100RMB (around 16 $) - highly recommend them. Note, that you need at least 1,5 hour to pass through the City, but it's just better to plan in advance some more time to see everything.
The last thing I would like to mention are some ladies around the city. They are very nice and friendly, they don't offer anything - just talk with you. However after some time you can be sure, that they invite you for a cup of tea. I was on that tea and it costed me almost like 40 years old single malt whiskey. So my advise is just be careful!"
"We went originally with a guide and got the limited tour & history lesson. So we went back on our own and went through all the security checks again. The 2nd time we went to the tourist info office and were given a map which we found invaluable. We ended up spending 6 hours and ventured to the outer buildings to get more of the history. The whole complex is 720,000 sq metres and incl 9999.5 rooms. We visited the Clock room and were fortunate that we were there for the 11am chimes, so lucky. Such a huge area to cover and hard to take it all in. Can understand why they offer a 12 month pass of 10 visits for locals. Not sure which is No 1 on my Bejing tourist visit list -The Wall or the Forbidden City, I think it's a draw. Can't visit Beijing without visiting the Forbidden City"
Absolutely must be seen. Tonns of walking included. Prepare to be exhausted and shocked in a good way. A place u cannot miss in any conditions.
"visited forbidden city last week on a windy day,
use your walking shoes instead your fancy boot! beware of rickshaw scam and pickpocket"
"I was only in Beijing for 1.5 days. Day 1 was spent at the wall, and the next morning before flying back to the USA I rushed out to the Forbidden City.
We walked through the gates and into courtyard after courtyard.

It was absolutely amazing and I WISHHHH we had time to go inside. Exploring would have been amazing.

If for some reason you are like me and won't have time to do the tours etc and just have an hour to walk in, do it. It's still breath-taking gorgeous.
Just know that you can walk very far into the forbidden city -- but you can NOT simply turn around and leave. You must exit a side gate and just walk around and around to get back to where you came from. It took quite a long time and we were concerned about missing our flight!

So, be aware that you can walk into the courtyards (free of charge) but you must exit the side/back... so it won't be a quick in-and-out trip. It'll still take 1 hour!"
"The Forbidden City is a really interesting for about an hour. Keep in mind that it will probably take you much longer to go all the way through it. The history of the place is really intriguing. The architecture and design work is beautiful and quintessentially Chinese. (When Westerners think of ""Chinese"" designs, they are thinking of what came out of the Ming and Qing dynasties that occupied the palace buildings.) Overall, the buildings are in excellent condition, though some have been painted much more recently than others. All of it is beautiful, and it is a neat place to visit, but for me the intrigue wares off as my feet get tired and as row after row of buildings in this enormous palace all begin to look remarkably similar.

If you do visit and don't think you will get enough walking in otherwise, I suggest starting at the south end of Tiananmen (there is a subway stop very close), taking a brief walk through Tiananmen Square, moving north through the Forbidden City, and finishing with a tour of Jingshan park, which is just across the street (a brief walk up the hill takes you to a small temple that has an incredible view looking out over the Forbidden City). Once you go back down the hill, you can catch a cab back to wherever you need to go.

Tired feet aside, if you can just do a few things in Beijing, this should be at or near the top of your list."
"As everybody knows, this is the top attraction in Beijing.

Get there early, be ready to walk (it's massive) and bring you camera.

It's an unforgettable place, so make sure you have plenty of time to explore it."
"This place must be seen. There is so much history in this one large enclosed area. Without a guide, you can read about each building or monument and learn a lot. With a good guide (I can't recommend one, I relied on my wife, who's Chinese) you could learn even more.

The place is enormous, truly a small city, and when you're there, you're walking through passageways and on stone paths that were used by Emperors 600+ years ago. Something to think about.

Don't miss this place. Yes, it costs to get in, but it's a relatively small amount, and you'll easily find yourself snapping 100+ pictures as you see monument after monument.

Also, I found the gift shop to be surprisingly reasonable!"
"I visit few of the so called must-see sights as I often find the experience ruined by tourism. The Forbidden City is probably one of the few places that are big enough to absorb the hordes and I enjoyed strolling around the huge palace grounds without having to wrestle my way around. There's very limited access to the building themselves but walking around the structures, gardens and squares/courtyards was very worth it to me. Tip: watch out for the many touts and scams as you exit the palace."
"We did the self-guided audio tour. The tour got a little boring, but it was very interesting to see the palace and imagine how the emperor lived there back in the day. We went in December and while it was very, very cold with the windchill even at 0ºC, we had blue skies and sun and I think it was worth it to be rid of the smog."
"If you visit in the winter then bring your jacket. And thermals. And scarf. And beanie... There is a lot of waiting to see the various buildings and the wind is fierce.

Overall I was underwhelmed with the Forbidden City/Palace Museum. It was talked up so much! Perhaps we needed a better guide, or better weather.

The garden was very nice, my favourite spot."
Never visit The Palace Museum during China public holiday...........You will see nothing but only peoples.
"Enough has been said about how great this place is, so I am not going to repeat what was said.
Tips for a great visit:
1. If Chinese history is new to you, watch the LAST EMPEROR before you leave for China. It will make your visit more interesting.
2. There is no need to join a TOUR, just find your way there and rent a self guided audio tour device. It is very high tech using radio frequency sensor. Its like having a live guide telling you interesting information when you are at a certain location.
3. Unless you know how to bargain, gifts shops INSIDE the Museum is all of the places and offers great selections. Buying similar stuff outside needs some bargaining effort for good prices - too hard to most western visitors.
4. Bring a back pack, so that you do not have carry with hand - it covers at least 30 city block walking from one end to another."
"A lot of stuff to see there, give yourself some time and explore, the government actually allowed to see more now, they opened a lot more areas to explore. It’s really really amazing, if you have a guide to explain to you what everything is, even better. Grab your Nikon or any camera that you have and explore. I got to say, one of the most beautiful places that I have seen in my life. Lots of lots of history is written there."
"Our visit to what is commonly referred to as The Forbidden City, took place on a crystal clear day with blue skies and not a cloud in the sky.

This is a place full of temples and full of people of course, but also a place to find tranquility and solitude believe it or not - you just need to wander off on your own away from the crowds.

As this is the most busy tourist attraction in Beijing you cannot expect to have the FC to yourself, so be prepared for crowds. If you want to take photos of objects with no one else in the picture be prepared for a long day! Or think laterally literally.

There is a cost to enter, approx £10 each and there are many ticket windows open so although the queues may look long you will be served very quickly. Follow the procession of visitors up and into the main area.

We decided not to have a guide for this visit. We wanted to just wander around and find things out for ourselves. There are many guide books and pieces written on the Palace, so we can refer to those if we want to. There are many local tour guides offering their services in and around the entrance if you want to link up with one on the day.

To be honest, I had read up quite a bit about the FC beforehand, but if all slipped from my consciousness once we got into the city. The place is on a vast scale and you are overawed by it all. My advice is just take it all in.

To take photos that are a little off the beaten track and with less tourists in them, move along the temples to the right or left, ie think laterally. That way you can get a perspective on the marble squares, take in the palaces and also give a hint on how many people are there with you. I must have been lucky because I got quite a few photos like this with no one in them!

We had a cup of tea and a cake each from a tea room inside and the price was reasonable - about £3 for two teas and two cakes, so not inflated because of the location.

The Garden near the exit is beautiful. The trees are sculptures in their own right and even though the place was full of people you could still find some peace and quiet here too.

My only note of caution is upon exiting the FC. There are hundreds of rickshaw drivers touting for business. If you so much as make eye contact with them they will hound you for trade. We had one guy follow us for about 300 hundred meters before he realised we were not going to take one, and by that time he had moved too far from his pitch at. the exit so he hurried back to try and secure business from other tourists.

If you are in Beijing on holiday or for business then you will undoubtedly want to visit The Forbidden City. Do so as it doesn't disappoint."
"Expansive and grand, with opulent buildings and an exquisite garden decorated with rock formations, the Palace Museum (""Forbidden City"") is a must-see must-do for Beijing visitors who have at least three hours on hand. I would recommend taking an audio guide if you are alone. Personal guides make sense if you are in groups of 3 or more."
"You never been to Beijing if you didn't visit this palace. It's full of historical buildings, a large garden, the ancient imperial life, culture, arts, architecture and many more.
A must place to visit in Beijing."
"I went to the Forbidden City on Christmas Eve 2014 at 09:00. The weather was actually beautiful, cold and windy so no pollution and this greatly enhanced the visit as the buildings look magnificent against a blue sky.
If you go early enough the crowds are reduced and security much quicker - and if at all possible find a local guide who is approved by the China Tourism Board as this gets things moving much quicker in security and also gives you a great walk through of the history of the palace, the place in the Chinese Dynasties and the way of life here. This really adds to the history of the place.
The beautiful buildings are being restored in turn and matching to the original plans, colours and materials as possible and this allows a better feeling of what it was once like to live there.
There is easy access for limited ability and a few steps to climb to get up to the buildings but apart from that it is flat and paved.
Where possible don't use the main central (emperors) arches to access the next areas - use a side arch and your view into the next area is enhanced as there are less people and the view is better. It also allows you to stop and look and not be pushed through.
There are loos inside which are as good a public loos get in China (limited number of ""potty loos "" but remember your own loo roll :-)
Walk in from Tianaman Square and out through the furthest gate to appreciate the size of the forbidden city and to understand the Feng Shui of the place (which when built was THE important factor in the location and layout). This way you get the water to the south, the Man made mountain to the rear and the gates in sequence.
Take some water with you to sip whilst wandering the grounds and make sure you see the garden courtyard from the emperor and empress/concubines which is small but beautiful in its own way."
"This is a must-visit attraction if you are visiting Beijing for the first time. Also, if you are a fan of Chinese imperial dramas, you will definitely want to take a look at the famous Forbidden City. Entrance is now restricted to the south gate, where you can buy the entrance tickets - 40 yuan (no need to book online, the queue moves very fast). Once you are inside the Palace, try to get a free palace map to help you navigate your tour inside. There are some halls that are still furnished and you can take a look at the decorations through the glass windows. Some exhibitions required separate admission tickets and the precious clock exhibits (10 yuan) is worth the money."
"Visited the palace with a tour group. Though there were many domestic tourists, the queue was short, and we were able to enter the palace comfortably. The area is huge, doors and buildings with amazing architecture, and outstanding colors too. Other than Great Wall, this is a must visit monument in Beijing."
"Get here early (opens at 8:30 am) for the least stressful visit. It gets very crowded, very fast.

Once inside its like there are never ending, gold pagodas. Really amazing that many of the buildings are 500+ years old.

We did not have the ability (with 3 bored kids) to see many of the exhibits but all the signs are in English and have interesting facts. They have rooms restored to what they might have looked like for the emperors - very neat. And the Cypress trees and rock formations in the garden are spectacular.

I would like to go again without kids and really enjoy the history!"
"The Forbidden City is essential to an understanding of the history of China, and books must be read prior to a visit.

It is absolutely mandatory to engage in a government approved guided tour of the Forbidden City. The Forbidden City may require several visits to understand the complexities of a long history.

Lying at the city center and called Gu Gong in Chinese, the Forbidden City was the imperial palace for twenty-four emperors during the Ming and Qing dynasties. It was first built throughout 14 years during the reign of Emperor Chengzu in the Ming Dynasty (1368-1644).

Rectangular in shape, it is the world's largest palace complex and covers 74 hectares. Surrounded by a 52-meter-wide moat and a 10-meter-high wall are more than 8,700 rooms. The wall has a gate on each side."
"The Forbidden City is an amazing place in Beijing, and something everyone should see when they're in the city! The history of the Palace Museum is fascinating. The Forbidden City itself is very big, so if you want to see it all I suggest leaving at least 2 hours free for visiting. As we were with a tour group, we didn't have much time to explore the garden area at the back of the museum, but from what we saw this was also stunning. Went in December and it was super cold. It's quite open so wear warm clothing if going during the winter."
"We spent a quick half day here and an hour or so queuing to get in as well. It is picturesque, but so much in china is, and here the crowds were really overwhelming. We didn't take a guide as we just wanted to look, but due to numbers our visit was quite rushed. I do feel its a must see but it's very very pressured and touristy and there is so much else to see in Beijing."
Loved this as much as the Great Wall. Went in DECEMBER so few tourists. Would like to have had an extra day at the end to go again there is so much to see. Very authentic and untouched. The sense of space is amazing. TIP you enter one end and take an hour or so to get through to the other end -be prepared for a lot of walking. Read up about the history beforehand to get the most out of this fantastic palace. Dont go at weekends.
"It is one of great museums in the world. It is the refine anitque palace of China whatever from the architectural design to royal family used items, no anywhere can compared with this.
From there you may lean a lot of Chinese history.
The only I complaint is too many visitors."
"The Forbidden City, now know as The Palace Museum is simply magnificent & beautiful. Lying in Beijing City centre & north of Tiananmen Square, it served as the imperial palace for emperors during the Ming & Qing dynasties. The Palace Museum is enormous & is the world's largest palace complex covering 74 hectares. Take your time to explore & enjoy the lovely palace complex. Good photo opportunity so don't forget to bring your camera. My friends & I truly enjoy the visit & will treasure our lovely memories of The Palace Museum. Definitely a must-see when you are in China."
"This place is HUGE! It was amazing and breathtaking. To be able to stand on the same ground that the emperors stood, and also the many famous travelers like Samantha Brown, was simply amazing.

The history of this place is not to be missed, so be sure to go here with a tour guide. There is a souvenir shop too :)

All in all, one of the best places I've ever visited in my whole life!"
"very large and magnificent open air museum,its so large that I afraid that you lose your time or some interesting places if you have not a good guide, although in reality every coroner of this palace is magnificent."
"So it is now called the Palace Museum which is a bit confusing. We made a day of it. We decided to go early on a Sunday, because we wanted to see the Forbidden City, Jingshan Park, and Beihai park all in one day. They are all right next to each other. We hired a local guide that worked with the Palace Museum, so he was able to guide us through quicker, as he was able to maneuver around lines, and get tickets faster, etc. So we actually got through the Forbidden City with his guidance in 2 or 3 hours. The disadvantage of going on Sunday is there can be more people. But the advantage is that you can experience Chinese life and culture at it best in Jingshan park, as the musical and singing groups, as well as family come out on Sunday, to do their thing, so it is alive with singing, and music, and Chinese families. We read the guide books and figured out to enter the Forbidden City from the South Gate and exit through the North Gate and right across the road (New Jing Shan Street) enter the JingShan Park. My wife talked me into going to the Forbidden City and the Jingshan park on a Sunday, though we didn't get there as early as we should have. It was not as crowded as I feared, and once we entered the park (slight admission price) we heard and saw groups of Chinese people (sometimes joined by Westerners too) singing and playing instruments. This apparently was their day off to come to the park and enjoy them selves. The park is quite large and beautiful and also has a long history of royal use. There is more there than one can digest in a day, but in my mind the not to be missed was to climb Feng Shui Hill also well known to locals as Coal Hill and see the view of the Forbidden City. It is pretty spectacular as you are right there on top of the Forbidden City looking down on it. There are quite a few steps to get up there though. Also not to be missed is to figure out how to exit Jingshan park right into Beihai Park. It took us a few minutes even with my GPS enabled IPAD to guide us. But the GPS was able to locate us on the map of the park (map blown up from regular IPAD map feature) and guide us to Beihai park which is right next to JingShan park. Without the IPAD with its GPS (Windows and IPhones will work too), it would have taken quite a while to find our way out of JingShan park to Beihai park. So this is how we did Forbidden City, Jingshan Park, and Beihai Park, on a Sunday all in one day. Caveat, if your guide wants to take you to see the last Emperor's Nephew in Jingshan Park, where he is doing calligraphy for charity, you can go and see his work, just be aware, that he is very likely not the real last Emperor's Nephew, and they will want to sell you his work, which is quite nice. Just be aware, and if you like it, negotiate accordingly, knowing that he is not the last Emperor's Nephew. We ended up buying a small calligraphy that he did right there in the studio in Jingshan Park in front of us for $50, after my wife negotiated them down from a much higher price. Afterwards we saw pictures in an online forum of several different men posing as the last Emperor's nephew in this capacity. So you might say we were scammed, but we have a story and a calligraphy from our trip now on our wall at home :-)"
"It's an incredible feeling to be able walk on the soils of one of the greatest palace city of the world. The former dwelling place for the emperors and the heart of ancient Chinese administrations, the forbidden city has seen the ups and downs of 2 dynasties. I have visited this incredible site 3 times over the past years and I am still loving it. Definitely not to be missed when you get a chance to visit Beijing."
"The Palace Museum (Forbidden City) is beautiful and incredibly large. We came in the off season (end of November) and were still surprised by the number of visitors we had to contend with. I am very thankful we didn't have to wade through the seas of tourists that must be there during the summer! Though you can go through the museum from north to south or south to north it seemed the standard was to begin at Tiananmen Square and walk north. After passing through the five gateways you will reach the Emperor's Palace. We nearly died getting a picture of the throne itself - it is a free-for-all as everyone tries to push to the front to see and take pictures. Thankfully, I am over 6' tall and my wife was pushing me forward while others were trying to push me back! In the back of the museum is a small be beautiful garden before you exit the back gate. Outside the Palace Museum is a very attractive area as well as there is a moat running around the outside. When planning your trip, definitely make this a must-see."
"Well, this Forbidden City area is surprisingly much larger than anything I had imagined. There are three gate buildings and two courtyards before you get to the terraces and buildings that everyone has seen in pictures and movies. Then seeing all the real living spaces is also somewhat of a surprise, as i, at least, did not know that so many living areas were included amongst and inside the Forbidden City walls. I forget how many actual rooms they told us there are to it all, but there are thousands. The actual Emperors rooms are behind really THICK glass, and have not been touched for thousands of years, and are very, very dusty, behind the glass. The Throne Room is open, but is also fairly dusty, and dark; hard to take a picture. All-in-all it is pretty amazing! On exiting the Forbiddne City by the North Gate, our tour group, walking through the arch way, just all dropped their jaws, as there was soooooo many people on the outside plaza - it looked like a major football game, being attended by 100,000 people, had just let out in New York!!"
"Visiting the Forbidden Palace within the Forbidden City was a memorable experience during my visit with my friend in Beijing. It was a freezing day at negative 3 degrees, when we went to the forbidden city then to the palace and then to the palace museum. for those who love asian / chinese architecture, and the arts, this place is the where you should be. just bring in some power bars and a small bottle of water, to keep you energized. no food and drinks sold inside the facility :)"
"To get the impact of the feudal conception of supreme royalty, you must see The Forbidden City, Palace Museum.
This imperial palace began in 1407 and was completed in 1420 and comprises 9,000 rooms and 980 buildings.
In 1987 it was declared a world heritage sight. Part of the palace collections is now located in the National Palace Museum in Taipei.
We arrived early on a Sunday and entered though the south Gate. One of many rooms you will want to see is the, ""The Throne in the Hall of Preserving Harmony"" and ""The Throne in Palace of Heavenly Purity"". We met a tour guide who took us though the high lights and shared the history with us.
We exited the by way of the North Gate and entered into the ""Jingshan Park"" and hiked up ""coal hill"", where you can get a bird's eye view from the three story pavilion. It is well worth the climb- Great Picture opportunity!. I must warn you if you go there on a Sunday, (which I liked doing, because families are out and there are people playing music and singing and kids enjoying themselves) do not believe someone telling you that you can meet ""The Last Emperor's Nephew"" - it is a scam!"
"It's quite mind-blowing how big this space is. It is well guarded by security officers and an entrance fee of 40rmb is required. It's amazing how the intricate design and architecture withstands the test of time, albeit after going through many restoration works.

It was quite crowded despite it being the low season. However, due to the size of the place, we can hardly feel the crowd. It is quite a long walk from the entrance to the North Exit. I'll advise you to visit the Great Wall first as compared to climbing the great wall, the long walk is relatively easy."
"Cause the walk is going to be looooong!
So all the other guys have told you all you will see and appreciate, the history of the site, etc etc...so I will skip it. Yes it's worth it, yes I will do it again, yes it's more expensive inside to buy a souvenir and yes it is even better if you take a guide and spend a bit more to see more?
Now one thing more....this whole place is a major mega long one way street so to say..... Meaning you will go in through the entrance at the Tiananmen Square and go out on the opposite side...so if you want to cover all of it walking make sure you know what you are up to, and or prepare for taking a cab or public transportation once you reach the other side. Plan at least half a day for this."
"I have visited The Forbidden City (Palace Museum) three times, and feel like I have only begun to scratch the surface of the former home of the Ming and Qing Dynasties.

It sits across from Tianamen Square on acres of prime real estate and its several hundred buildings offer a fascinating glimpse of life in the Royal Court from the 17th to 20th Centuries. The architecture and classical layout could be studied for years - and has been.

Pro Tip - You need to find a good guide to make this really worthwhile. They are available through hotels, but I usually just walk around Tianamen for a few minutes and have always been approached by potential guides. Make them show you their credentials and be sure you understand their English. The price is always negotiable, but try not to be insulting. All my guides have been excellent so far.
Pro Tip 2 - This is an outdoor event. You will be walking around for hours with little time spent indoors. So, pick a nice day, bring water, good shoes, sunglasses and camera. There will be crowds, but the place is so big that they seldom become unbearable. It is acceptable to tip your guide if you were impressed with his/her knowledge and personality.
After half a day here, rest for a few hours, and consider an indoor activity for the late afternoon.
Unless you have a few weeks in Beijing, you just can't see it all."
I got the impression that this has been the hiding place for the Royal families during hundreds of years. Here they had the opportunity of living a great life without beeing observed by the Chineese people. What a life with hundreds of concubines and so on!
"Poor rating mainly because of the scam. Otherwise I would rate Beijing a 4. There have been a Myriad of write-ups on variants of this so I will keep mine short.

Was in China on Business but managed to get 24 hours ant the end of the trip for some site seeing in Beijing.

Young Chinese guy (~ 30 yrs old, heavier set.) speaking excellent English walks along side as I am taking an evening walk and snapping pics near the entrance of Forbidden city. We strike up conversation and he indicates he is an accountant with with Chinese Construction Bank. Seems to be familiar with finance and business and after walking the square a bit an learning a few things decide to have a beer in a side street off of the big open pedestrian street south of Tianamen Square. He picked the spot... a downstairs entrance and a private tea room. We each had a beer and a very pleasant chat learning more about China and I was thinking it was time to go. But he insisted on sharing tea with his new found friend. I said sure OK. When the bill came. I was shocked that the little pots of tea were 380 RMB each ($ 65). The beer and snacks were a bit overpriced, but not as ridiculously as the tea. He also acted like he did not have enough to pay the bill but I forced the issue and got him to cough up all but $50 RMB of his half of a $1050 RMB bill. Realized at that point that I had been had and with just a day in Beijing the next day before my flight home, I did not want to cause any sort of commotion that could get me detained. In the end, I paid $550 RMB ($90) for a beer and pretzels and a very small pot of tea.

THE next evening I went for a walk in the same area and was approached by a middle aged woman and a younger gal who I figured was in training. Spoke perfect English, very polite. I knew what was to come so I went along with their mini tour of that area but when it came time to head to a tea house, I looked at my watch and politely excused myself. I could see the look of frustration after they spent some 25 minutes telling me about the the area.

I had not walked more than 5 minutes and a young Chinese gal approached me. I got a bit more tour of that side of the square and excused myself when going for coffee was mentioned. again. A look of disbelief on her face that I did not want to go for tea. You gotta admit that she was very pleasant and well mannered and I am sure most of their marks"" people would have gone the next step in the scam. .

6 or 7 minutes later at the south end of the square a young chap again speaking excellent English walks up and we repeats the same process. It ends the same as the above.

For it was a bit of redemption of beating them at their own game.

Bottom line is if you want to do your part for mankind, waste their time and after yo break off, turn them in."
"Be prepared for the crowd, be prepared to track, yes I mean track because this palace is huge!
There's gonna be a lot of photo opportunity!
Saw some restoration work being done. Hope this place can stand the test of time.
Watch your bags as we witness a couple of police officer arresting a pair of father and son thieves."
The sheer size of the structure and the roof support architecture but the display cabinets glass panes were not well cleaned. Trash bins/baskets were placed but not utilized.
"Gorgeous and grand. One of the most amazing palaces in the world.

Make sure to go early. If you exit from Tiananmen West Metro, expect to see a long queue just to clear security. I suggest going from Qianmen metro, walking through Tiananmen to get to the Forbidden City instead."
You definitely need to see this place when you are traveling in BJ! I recommend you to go first to the Tiaanmen Square and from there walk to the Palace.
It's a huge place with beautiful architecture s. Lots to see n learn. Prepare to spent a few hrs there. Worth visiting.
"The palace museum is a historically rich site near Tiananmen. Here are the pros and cons:

Pros:
1. Security is tight in that area. All bags are checked at checkpoints near the palace. It is a very safe tourist spot as there many police officers patrolling.

2. The palace is big. You need the whole morning to explore the area.

3. The artefacts are generally well-preserved. There are also english captions to describe most of the artefacts, amid broken english.

4. The place is clean and the toilets are clean too.

Cons:
1. You have to willing to pay more to have a meaningful experience. There are a few exhibition halls that require you to pay extra maybe around 10 to 20 renminbi to enjoy the rare museum exhibits like jewelry and artefacts. The good news is that it is well worth the amount you pay. Cause the items in these halls are are and historically important. However, if you factor in the total amount you pay in all the special exhibition halls, this adds up to quite a bit. But you probably have no choice. Cause your experience will be limited to drab buildings if you refuse to pay.

2. The souveniors are more expensive than other tourist areas in Beijing, which is expected due to its location.

In conclusion, this palace is definitely worth the visit due to its historical significance. However, please be prepared to pay more for the various exhibition halls to enjoy a complete and meaningful experience."
"The Forbidden City is a huge place that was home of emperors and their households. It is now a museum of huge historical significance. Be ready to spend several house in this crowded palace, which is totally worth visiting. You do not need an interpreter as you can rent GPS audio guide from inside the museum."
"What a huge site! It takes about a half hour just to walk from one end to the other. Whilst a lot of the architecture is the same after a while, it is still worth seeing given it is where the Chinese Ming dynasty rulers lived for so many centuries, and gives you a good perspective of the power they wielded when considering the living conditions of locals in the hutong villages just close by!"
"That said, I recommend doing it with a private guide if you can. The sheer size continues to amaze me and not sure how I would have navigated on my own not speaking Chinese. We were lucky to be there when skies were clear and lines were short. Our guide even knew where there was a four star ( very clean) western toilet. Evidently such a popular stop that several group tours were sitting outside hearing about the history of the a Forbidden Palace ( a bit odd to us)"
You walk through building to a courtyard through a building or gate to another courtyard several times. A very historical site that shouldn't be missed.
"I loved the movie The Lost Emperor, and still have it on my wish list to see again. It was great to stand on the site of the Forbidden City. It does need some conservation work, and given all the visitors this should be affordable."
An incredible sight!! The buildings were amazing -- such colors and intricate details. You can spend several hours and be amazed the entire time.
"More is closed than open
long ticket lines but they move quickly
poor signage
clock and treasure galleries had amazing items but exhibits were run down, dirty, dusty, etc.
poor wheelchair access to galleries and buildings--lots of thresholds and stairs, often no access, one area had a broken elevator
not much to eat
lots and lots of walking
amazing construction, especially water feature/fountains ( no water running)
headsets in numerous languages for rent--don't work well and often had to start over"
"We were not only disappointed in this but in the Forbidden City as well. There is not a lot here but a complex of buildings that were not more than living quarters and storehouses. The museum has very little of interest. We had a tour guide, but he was quite difficult to understand so we did not get a good explanation for any of the buildings, etc, even though I believe he tried the best he could."
Of course everyone goes to the Forbidden City - and for good reason. Clearly meets its expectations and worth a 2-3 hour time committment to see the entire huge area.
"This was everything I was expecting and more…yes even the crowds! Being one of the main attractions in Beijing it’s always crowded. You need to allow at least two hours; this gives you time to wander through and see most of the main buildings. You do need to be patient if you want to get photos of the inside of the buildings. There are always multiple tour groups and they all want a photo! They get very pushy and you get jostled around a bit. I realised there were two options; be patient and wait for a break in the tour groups or get a bit pushy with the rest of the crowd. I tried both options with varying degrees of success….do have some great photos though!
An absolute must see in Beijing!"
"Of course, it is crowded...but this is spectacular. If you have read about the Dowager Empress, you can look at her quarters and the ""yellow curtain.""
There are many, many tours -- just wait a bit and it may clear out so you can get a peek at things."
"This palace is just magnificent and so big...
If you want to take a closer look at every place here you'll probably need a half day from morning till afternoon...
There's a lot to look at and I want to return here because the tour just showed us the main attraction.
They provide foreign language electronic guide..."
Great cultural and historical displays. Good collection of artistic and historical items. Avoid the crowds.
"It does get very crowded, so if you want to see into each building you have to be patient or try to squeeze through the crowd, sometimes I just held my camera over everyone's head and clicked away.

The garden area out the back is very beautiful, especially after the long walk through the rest of the palace, where there is even one speck of grass."
"Best time of year is early October, your need to spend a minimum of half a day because there is so much history to see and it can become crowded especially on weekends. Tip for the ladies, there are two types of toilets, the tradition hole in the ground and the western style. You will see what I mean. The buildings and the stone carving is thankfully preserved and under ongoing restoration bringing back the vibrant colours. Be patient in quest as these soon move on but do give yourself time to absorb the rich history that you just cannot read about in a book."
"The Palace Museum (aka The Forbidden City) was on our 'must see' list during a recent 4-day trip to Beijing. We visited in mid November, after peak season, but it was still pretty crowded. Initially we had intended to walk around by ourselves but it became clear very early that we needed some help negotiating ticket lines and and getting going. A very polite guide approached us with excellent English skills (Tony: tonyniu03@163.com) and offered his services for the afternoon at a reasonable price. We accepted and immdiately experienced the benefits; he bypassed all the regular lines to procure entrance tickets quickly and then got us through security and into the palace grounds themselves. He was a very attentive presence and could explain all the history we were looking at. I highly recommend getting a good local guide and Tony fit the bill nicely; we would not have got nearly as much out of this visit without him. The museum grounds are absolutely enormous; we spent about 4 hours inside and still did not manage to see everything. This is an attraction you might want to visit twice... Plan on a lot of walking, though fortunately the grounds are fairly flat and non-demanding to walk. We started at the South gate and generally worked our way in a Northerly direction exiting at the North gate where we found Jingshan park. This contains the highest point in Beijing and a commanding 360 degree view of the entire city, the mountains beyond and the Palace Museum to the South. We were incredibly fortunate to have arrived on the day that the APEC summit ended and were recipients of beautiful clean air, blue skies and a view to the horizon (including the mountains to the North and West) which resulted in some stunning photographic opportunities. We closed out our visit with a nice tea ceremony at the state-owned tea shop (where we got some good, but expensive souvenirs). This was a fabulous introduction to millenia of Chinese history, culture, symbolism and people. I strongly recommend a guide (and typically I am a person who totally avoids guided trips) to maximize your understanding and value."
"This palace compound is enormous. Definitely go to the Clock and Treasure Galleries. The extra cost is worth it. Be prepared to walk on uneven surfaces and up and down lots of thresholds. As like most places in China, the Forbidden City is not wheelchair friendly despite the fact that they lend them out for a deposit. Please note that they need to be returned to the entrance, even though you don't usually exit there. Most people walk straight through from the south entrance to the north exit. It is amazing to see the detail in the architecture and to realize how old everything is. We rented the headset which was useful. It comes with many language options. The ticket line seems long, but moves quickly."
"This is the centre piece of the Forbidden City.
Give yourself at least half a day to cover all the Forbidden City. Bring good walking shoes and a botlle of water!! Bring some money with you as there entrance fees for the various sections of the Forbidden city, See photo of ticket stub ... 120 Yuan entrance fee!!!
Lovely architecture all around!!
Beware of crowds ,,,, we visited on an October Friday afternoon and it was quite busy with tourists....I can't imagine what it would be like on a Saturday!!!"
"First, allow 2 to 3 hours and be prepared to explore the whole city on foot. It's worth the effort.

The Forbidden City was home to 24 Emperors, and is a chance to experience real-life Chinese history, culture and symbolism.

Find a street vendor outside the Forbidden City and buy a book about the Forbidden City. Negotiate the price, don't be ripped off. Hire a guide, they tell the history and explain each area and building. Again haggle, but its invaluable.

A must do...."
Went 4 times in under a week still didn't see everything. See the Clocks - amazing. Wander around on your own. People are friendly and helpful. Your may be asked to pose for a photo! Feel like a film star!
"Big, typically Chinese what means BIG. So a lot of walking. 4 hours is like running. But very crowded so be there early and chose middle week days. Most of the buildings can be seen oly from the outside. Luckily it was renovated before Olympics."
You really have to include this on your itinerary...not because it is so amazing but not seeing it would be like not seeing Buckingham while visiting London. That said it is a really nice place but be prepared to walk and walk and much of it is very similar to what you just saw. The garden at the back is a beautiful oasis. I guess to sum this up I really enjoyed the beginning of our tour and the end (it all new and intriguing when you start and the garden at the end) but the middle was kind of monotonous.
"There is SO much history in China...You can absolutely walk the Forbidden City by yourself or group but you'll learn much more and be drawn into the experience by joining a tour with a guide. My daughter and I cringed at the idea of allowing a guide to show us around but in the end we were quite appreciative.... A good guide and help connect the dots on the many historical, political, cultural and artistic elements you'll see and make it a lot more enjoyable.

Our 2nd favorite thing we did on this trip was to walk outside the exit of the museum, which in my mind will always be the Forbidden city, to the Jing Shang Park. The view after a 10-15 semi strenuous but rewarding walk up, was wonderful, especially near sunset. Enjoy.

Another tip: bring your own water and snacks. The food in the Palace is horrible; stale semi sweetened popcorn...yuk."
"Also known as The Forbidden City this is worth a visit although the palaces are all pretty much the same so once you have seen one, the others are pretty much duplicates of this. The area the Forbidden City takes up is vast so be prepared to spend several hours visiting this place of interest. You can't actually go inside the temples / palaces and they really isn't a vast amount to see inside them. Some are in better condition than others and there seemed to be some restoration work taking place inside a few. The decoration of the exterior of the buildings is very intricate and the carvings quite beautiful. It's worth paying for the audio guide (available in most languages) to get a full understanding of the history of this cultural site. As in other reviews, I have to agree, get there early as the queues do get very long and the crowds visiting are vast and rather annoying! You have to pay extra to visit the clock exhibition and I would suggest it's worth doing although I was surprised to see the quantity on European clocks on display and also how dusty the whole area was! The gardens at the very end of the grounds are quite tranquil and are a nice way to end the tour. Toilet facilities are available but not the best. Reccomend you carry toilet tissue & anti microbial gel. Tianaman Square is opposite this attraction and both only a 30 minute maximum taxi ride from the city centre"
"The Forbidden City is an interesting place that take us the wander about China's history.
Very beautiful and cultural visit."
"The Forbidden City is a must do in Beijing. It can be over crowded and difficult to see inside certain buildings, but it's nonetheless breathtaking."
Try to take the time to enjoy the area even though it is a very busy place. It is worthwhile to pay the little extra money to visit the other part of the Palace Museum that is not included in the ticket you purchased. The other area is less crowded giving you a little more time to enjoy and appreciate everything!
"Of course, the buildings and sheer scale, very impressive. THousands of people, well organised but still thronging. Waited perhaps 20' for tickets. The main halls, the largest three, were all closed, you coudl glimpse through a football crowd into one of them only. No explanations offered. Some of the smaller side exhibits, highly recommended, though they were a long trawl to find!
Ceramics museum.
Clock exhibit.
Opera theatre.
And the first huge courtyard visited, an amazing experience, not to be missed despite the difficulties."
"Visited on weekend and the crowd was super massive. Make sure you had bought ticket before queueing to enter the Palace and bring extra water for drink.

Inside was a humongous area similar to a city. We walk for about 2-3 hours to explore it and I dont think we had explore it all. Using comfortable shoes recommended.

I found none english map. We only got brochure about Imperal Palace in Chinese language. It's better to get one from internet and print it for your personal copy.

Entrance ticket is 15 RMB. Audio guidance is available with additional fee for around 40 RMB."
"Did not have a lot of time at this site and whilst it’s quite extensive it is not as awe inspiring as I’d imagined. It was extremely busy (this also being the low season) and difficult to see into the throne room because of the volume of people. In fact you couldn’t go into any of the interior rooms that we saw which was disappointing. It is however a very large site, the courtyards are huge and you can see why it is classed as a very important cultural site."
"We visited as part of a tour group, which may have been advantageous as it seemed we could get through the barriers quite quickly. This was a place I have always wanted to visit, but for some reason, it didn't seem to fulfil my expectations. I think the vast crowds somewhat diminished the grandeur of the place. However, we did only spend 3 hours there, and walked down the middle of the complex where all the crowds were. It is unfortunate that entry to the buildings is prohibited now for I would have liked to have explored them. However, this had to be done due to damage by tourists. Despite these bad points, I would still recommend this museum as a must see site, and perhaps to spend longer than just a few hours to explore. We only saw a fraction of it. I would definitely visit the Palace Museum again if possible."
"I have been to the Palace Museum many times in my life, partially because it is wonderful and partially because I grew up there.

To many visitors, this place is also known as the ""Forbidden City"", or ""Gu Gong"" which humbly translates to the ""old palace"" in Chinese. it's a bit of an understatement but let me assure you that this is an IMPORTANT place.

You could end up spending a whole day trying to cover every corner, but you really don’t have to, I recommend spending some time in the living area and royal garden located in the back, which imo is the highlight of the forbidden city, that's where the emperors spent most of his day and night with his 3000+ wives, after briefly meeting with his ministers in the great halls in the morning :)

To me, I have probably visited this place too many times so that my jaw no longer drops, but what remains strong is the beautiful feeling of travelling in history.

last but not least, if you are visiting from the West you may find China really crowded, the washrooms require some skills and some people may seem a bit too ""friendly"", which probably applies here too. You need to be prepared for all that, but like I always remind myself when visiting a new country, try to look at things from the local's eyes, try to understand and adapt to the culture, which i think is a side benefit of travelling - learn to be open-minded and flexible. So, even with all the warnings that families or co-worker may have given, this place along with many others in China still worth to be on one's bucket list.

I believe it's closed on Mondays but do check their website to confirm before going. enjoy!"
"The place was grand, however the buildings were very poorly maintained. The wall paints were fading and nothing was in place to preserve it.

Overall okish, place was grand and does take away your breath."
"The palace is a must see with fantastic buildings. Truly unmissable and very reasonably priced.

However it is horribly busy with lots of tour groups and big crowds. We went mid week and first thing in the morning, so I don't think there is anyway of avoiding the crowds.

If you move away from the main N-S axis then it is much less busy, and nicer for it. We enjoyed the smaller halls and ceramics collection. The Clock Hall is very interesting, but mostly European. If you explore the W side of the complex you can see the rooms in which the emporers actually lived. However, all the most impressive rooms are surrounded by huge crowds."
"I was so looking forward to seeing the Imperial Palace as I had read so much about it and seen many more movies. This is a fabled place which was forbidden to commoners and many more parts forbidden to even Imperial women. After having visited it, I wish it had remained forbidden as it has lost all of its Imperial grandeur. They really should do something about crowd management.

Just the experience to get there was downright scary. We were in a huge long funnel-like line (really more of a crowd than a line as the Chinese do not believe in lining up for anything) and we could barely stay standing. Old women were screaming at us for not pushing our way through or moving fast enough, men were elbowing left right and center. It was sheer pandemonium and worst yet there was no way out of the line! After what seemed like an eternity, we finally made our way to the checkpoint which was manned by one disinterested guard.

After that horrific initial experience, we had to do more lining up for tickets and then insist on a guide. After this whole ordeal, we finally entered only to be mobbed by crowds of Chinese tourists all noisily talking at the top of their lungs, imperially pushing their way around and shoving their phones, often times narrowly missing whoever was in the way, at whatever was on display.

There was nothing regal about the sites as one could rarely make one's way through the throngs to see whatever throne or display cabinet. Worst yet, it didn't matter where you went in this large complex. Everywhere was mobbed, the Palace, the Museum, the gardens and even the toilets. About the only place which had relatively less people was the Museum run tourist shop.

So be forewarned and go at your own risk! There's a lot of history there but you will hardly be able to enjoy it."
"My experience at the Palace Museum was highly affected by the crowds there- the amount of people completely ruined my experience. I went in November, on a Thursday morning, and it was as packed as a concert, it was absolutely ridiculous. I waited half an hour outside the entrance in a queue (it's China, so lots of pushing and shoving) to get my bag checked, walk through a metal detector, and get pat down. Once I entered the actual complex to buy a ticket, I queued for another good 40 minutes (again, people cutting in line all over the place). Once inside, it was a constant battle to see things through the crowds and walk anywhere, it was just absurd. The buildings are nice to look at but other than that I felt it was a bit hyped. I did the clock exhibition too which was just okay, it annoys me that you have to pay extra for it, even though it's just 10 yuan. I also just felt uncomfortable the whole time because of all the military and police and guards everywhere, it makes you feel very tense. It's a must-see in Beijing I guess, but I got out of there as quickly as I could so I could have room to breathe!"
"I've visited this site over 40 times. It is so big and has so much on offer you have to prepare before you go. Read up on the history, architectural layout and some stories. Even then, to do the Palace Museum justice is impossible. A good local guide is invaluable and they will add to what you have already read. A second or third visit will give a better perspective, but you have to be dedicated. It is a big site, with big crowds and most people will have had enough after a couple of hours."
"This is a must-see for ANY visitor to Beijing. If you can, splurge for a private guide. The scale, quality and history/culture behind this is one of life's great moments.
spend 5 hours here!"
"We visited The Forbidden City as part of a Nexus tour to China. Unfortunately, our visit corresponded with an unannounced visit from a dignitary (they seemingly are all unannounced). As a result, half of the area was roped off. which made things very crowded in the remaining (public) half. Between the crowds and the time restrictions of the tour, we did not see much other than the outside of a lot of buildings and the Imperial Gardens (which were the highlight of the visit).
I'm told that most of the buildings are blocked off anyways but we were unable to see inside of even a single building. That said, we did love the Imperial Gardens."
"This was a very good attraction and many great photo opportunity. This will take about min. of 4 hours to look around and take photos. It is recommended to go first thing in the morning because it will be very crowded and to avoid the crowd if you are to take some photo of the emperor throne and more. The place is block off at the door way so you will not be able to step in to see the place but you can peek inside the place if you are at the rail. So once again if you do not want all the crowd and be able to casually walk and sight see better to go first thing in the morning. The palace is very big and if you take a moment to absorb in the view and imagine what it would be like to live there and how many people live there. At the end the place there are many buildings to the left and the right, you will not be able to see them but you can view from the top. Then there is the garden before you exit and that is a very great place to relax a little before exiting the palace. NOTE: It is great to go with a tour because you will get the history of the palace but you will not have much time to take quality photos. If you prefer to read on the history on your own, which we did. Go on your own and casually stroll around and take photos. Last make sure to bring a small bag for your hat, water and some snack because it will be a long walk. Have fun and enjoy the history."
"We visited the Forbidden City (as I believe most Westerners would call it, although I guess it is now officially named the Palace Museum) with a tour group, which had its pros and cons. The city complex is huge, so it was nice to have some guidance and information as we walked through. But I also would have liked to spend more time in many of the locations, especially the gardens at the north end, so it was hard to be hurried along.

I found it interesting that you couldn't enter many of the buildings - they would be roped off and you peered through the doorway at the items inside (like the Emperor's Throne). I'm not sure whether this is typical for China, but it made for huge crowds and elbowing at those few points as everyone scrambled to attempt to get a look inside. There were crowds of people the day we visited, which I gather is pretty typical.

Definitely an attraction that you could spend a lot of time visiting, and I'd recommend taking the time to wander around. Quick note on bathrooms - they exist and are mostly not Western-style, but the women in our group discovered that most will have at least one handicapped stall which has a Western toilet."
"Imperial palace of Ming & Qing dynasty for over 600 years, one of the great architectures in the world. Always crowd, from Nov-March is off peak season, entrance fee is cheaper"
"On a day long tour we had about two hours in the forbidden city. Upon entering there are two massive courtyards. More time is needed to explore the buildings behind the courtyards. Some rooms are open but for theist part the palace is huge, crowded and somewhat impersonal. The garden at the rear is the most intimate. Glad I've seen it but don't feel the need to go back."
"The forbidden city is big, much bigger than i was prepared for. I bought the audio tour which gives you info on your location using GPS. It will guide you along the north south route but hint at other buildings on the side for you to visit. Take your time. Will make you want to watch the last emperor again."
"It was like going back to the glory days of the dynasties involved. The buildings were well maintained and deeply brought back the history. Need a comfortable walking shoes because the area was very, very big."
"There are a whole lot of people here. It was so packed with people that it was uncomfortably claustrophobic, even for Beijing, which is saying something. We went on a cold Tuesday in October. Maybe we just picked the wrong day, but based on our admittedly very limited experience I'd have to say that if you are wanting to see the Forbidden City on a sweltering summer day during tourist season…well, just don't."
You can spend most of a day wondering through this beautifully restored complex. We enjoyed following the route that takes you through both sides of courtyards as well as the main middle halls. It is a lot of walking but there are places everywhere to sit and rest and plenty of restrooms along the way. Note for women - handicapped signs indicate western facilities. The English audio guide is good. We read Empress Orchid and the Last Empress prior to our trip so it was fun to see the locations where the history really took place. Don't miss the gorgeous garden at the end! Cabs drop you off at the corner of the complex where it is easy to follow the broad street to the main entrance. We found it not crowded in the afternoon.
"Impressive palace, and so much larger than I had expected. As with many sights in Beijing, it was full of crowds which made it difficult to fully appreciate the grandeur. Some areas were disappointing (the jewels exhibit), and other surprisingly interesting (the clocks exhibit)."
"The Palace Museum/Forbidden City is one of the most iconic sights in the world. It is the world's largest palace complex with over 900 buildings in the heart of Beijing. It was the home of the Emperors for almost 500 years. Incredible, awesome site. Must see.

However, it is an authentic Chinese experience. We went on a Tuesday as individuals who waited in the main security line. It took about 80 minutes to get through security. The line was almost all Chinese. Pushing, shoving, pressing into other people, spitting, and cutting in line are all acceptable behaviors in China. Yes, the Chinese rule so get used to it. This is their museum. There are no Disney crowd control techniques such as videos to entertain or estimated times for waiting or helpful security agents. It is a crush of humanity. So, please be prepared. We were not ready. The alternative is to take a tour. They tend to have less security hassles and better access directly into the palace complex.

Once inside, visitors wait to purchase entry tickets. This took maybe 15 minutes. Please note that there are no guides books for sale at the palace that are any good. Please do your homework upfront to make the place come alive. Finally, we entered the Palace. At the three major temples in the Outer Court, please expect a rugby scrum worthy of the All Blacks versus the Springboks to see the thrones. There are glass walls that protect the inside of each temple from the crowds. Large tour groups press each other like Maori warriors.

We only saw a few rooms in the Inner Court. The Imperial garden is a must. Stunning and magnificent. Please note that the condition of the Palace buildings vary. This complex suffered greatly during the 20th century and it still is being restored.

Final notes to new visitors. The Palace is closed on Mondays except in summer. Reviewers who suggest that visitors go near the end of the day, about 3:30 PM, make sense. It closes at 5:00 PM. The crowds and scrums are fewer later in the day based on comments from other tourists. Bathrooms facilities and food options inside the Palace are rare so make plans ahead of time.

Still, despite these challenges, the place is worth visiting for sure. A must."
"Can't believe I have actually been there! It has been a long time dream to see this and was not disappointed. Not to be missed. I loved the concubine's courtyard, so serene and peaceful."
"We went to this place late in the afternoon already although my children refuse to proceed here after our Mutianyu tour, this was never a regret. The place is astounding. Every architecture is well a picture. The bridge resembles that of the one in Venice. You can actually feel the serenity and the peacefulness of this place. This is one worth of a visit."
"Although it is crowded and the persistent pushing and shoving around certain areas gets annoying, it is simply one of the must see attractions in Beijing. The Forbidden City is the largest palace complex in the world and was the home of emperors for almost five hundred years."
"I visited the Palace Museum more than 10 years ago, so I decided it is time to revisit it since I'm in China. I am again surprised at it's vastness! With so many people visiting it at the time, the place does not feel too crowded except when trying to peep into the the dimly lite halls.

I wasted about 1 hour first queuing to clear the security then to purchase the tickets. If you have time, you can explore the side entrances. I think those side entrances will not have as many people, but then you will miss the Tiananmen (note: not this is the main gate before the Forbidden City gates and not the Tiananmen Square).

I rented the audio guide as I wanted to roam the palace on my own. However, the audio guide is a GPS activated guide. When I reached a certain location with the narrative, the guide will start narrating automatically. However, it cannot make the narrative and if you happened to step into another location with a narrative, the current narrative will automatically stop and the next one will start playing. And you will not be able to listen to the previous narrative again.

It was a bittersweet re-visit for me. I was able to roam and spend a lot of time and visit many more locations in the palace that was previously not opened. In addition, there are quite a few exhibitions that told of how life was in the palace previously.

However, with the masses of people visiting daily, many of the sculptures have lost their definition. I remembered in my previous visit, each pillar around each hall were beautifully sculpted. But this time round, i could not even make out what the the patterns were. It is loss like these that make me wonder what conservation efforts the Chinese are taking to preserve such a monument!"
"The way in which the complex is built renders itself to a very impressive viewing experience. The arched entrances one has to go through when visiting each new courtyard is almost like an official introduction to the new part you will see. Now watching a movie like ""The Last Emperor"" will make new sense!"
"The Forbidden city is a must do in Beijing. The sheer size of the complex is amazing, and what goes with that in China is large crowds. Still, its large enough that you can generally sneak off to the side for a few moments of peace and perhaps a photo without hundreds of people in the background.
I did this as part of a tour, and it was useful to have someone to explain things to me. Little things like how to tell how important each building is by looking at the decorations on the outside of the roof.
This was my first trip to China, and first experience other than the great wall, so I really enjoyed going to each of the rooms and hearing about the long history behind them.
My tour was small, just three of us, I'd suggest something like this or on your own. The large groups looked impossible to manage and it didn't look like a great experience."
History galore with some cool exhibits that will put you back in time. You will see history right before your eyes that is mind blowing. There is so much information that you are not taught in school. Cool place to learn and see the Chinese way of life...in many eras.
After watching so many remake of chinese legendary series and finally able to visit the place they use to film it is amazing. The only problem was that the automatic audio tour player stopped a few times and we have so much problem as we had to restart all over.
"This was our third visit in 12 years to the Palace and it was certainly worth the repeat visit. The grounds are large and there are courtyards within courtyards, and much to explore. Look into the rooms to see how the old Emperors, eunuchs and palace retinue used to live, as well as the classical pottery, jewellery and furniture.

You start from the edge of Tiananmen Square, make your way to the Palace Museum, and end up near Jingshan Park. However, I would suggest making your way back to the main entrance when you are done, so plan your walk accordingly. If you decide to exit at Jingshan Park, where the White Pagoda is located, do note that transport options are difficult. There is no metro nearby and there are usually long queues for the busses and taxis. So you might end up having to walk back to the Tiananmen area along the outside of the walls/moat, which is a longer distance.

Also, if you want to take a tram, hop onto the ones with lots of people, and not the individual rickshaws - these might look charming, but you may end up paying more than you bargained for as these are run by scammers. For instance, they may tell you it costs 3 yuan, but halfway through the ride, you may end up being forced to pay up to 300 yuan or more."
"Pros: Very Beautiful architecture, interesting information on the Emperors who lived here (we had a local tour guide) and just generally Impressive.
Cons: It's huge…it's crowded…toilets are filthy…and what I was most disappointed with was that it's all been totally rebuilt. Not that they could do anything else after it was burnt down during a war, and they repainted it for the olympics…I don't know…I'd rather see my ancient buildings as they stand, and not replicated. But still, worth a visit, just make sure you have a guide or the literature, if not, you'll be wandering around not knowing what you're looking at."
"So incredible and immense, that even china sized crowds could not fill it up! Even without a guide, truly impressive!"
"The Forbidden City is rich in history, art, and tradition. This place is quite large, so plan for a few hours. The buildings, especially the intricate designs and paintings, are absolutely beautiful. The audio self-guided tours provided a wealth of information. Make sure to start at the South gate, as the North gate was exit only. Check out Jinshang park afterwards (outside the North Gate) for a view of the entire park."
"Forbidden City is China’s largest and best-preserved collection of ancient buildings, and the largest palace complex in the world."
"The imperial buildings and corridors are endless. Beautiful buildings, yes, but after a few hours they all start to look alike. Be prepared: the lavatories are simply filthy. Maps are available in English for payment (in Chinese they're free of charge). The museum buildings with art and old items such as knives and pottery are interesting and worth a visit."
"My wife and I visited in October 2014. This was the Chinese Imperial Palace from the Ming dynasty to the end of the Qing Dynasty. Most everything has been removed from the buildings and taken to Taipei. The cost to enter is $9.60 USD per person. The Forbidden City is spread out over a large distance. There is just empty building after empty building as far as the eye can see. With nothing to see you are left with Chinese people pushing and shoving. Beijing is the most horrid destination on planet earth. The pollution/air quality is 13 times worse than the levels set by the World Health Organization, this is according to a Beijing newspaper. A total waste of time."
Must visit. I found the scale of the place mind blowing. The photo ops are endless. The architecture and the history are very interesting.
Amazing collection of treasures even after a good majority was taken to Taiwan. I wish I had more time to look around.
"Also known as the Forbidden City the roads and buildings just go on and on and on. Follow the main central paths from South to North. If you have the extra time you can explore the Clock Gallery and Treasure Gallery but there is an extra charge and you will have to back track to see the central buildings and the garden near the exit.
Palace closes strictly at 5pm and you will be forced towards the exit.
Progressing from South to North through the gates really shows you how grand and impressive the imperial dynasties were."
"At first we got exited from the expirience to be there and then we found out that all the furnitures are old, lots of places that repeats themselves. We became tired.Hungry. Expensive and not tasty food. Expensive drinks. After two hours just go to another place. There is no more to see. Please repair the furnitures and open the rooms to visitors. It is frastrating to look throught the windows."
"Be prepared for a long walk and to be overwhelmed by the size of this palace! The crowds are heavy but if you avoid the main walkway down the centre, you won't even notice this palace is so big! (My group did this but I took a short detour to the centre because I wanted to cross the centre bridge - which, historically, only the Emperor was allowed to use!) I really recommend reading about the Palace, its symbolism and history before going. I was lucky enough to have an exhibit about the Forbidden City in my hometown before I went, and it really helped me see the details that I may have overlooked - such as the decorations on the corners of the roofs - the number of figures there represents the importance of the building. Don't miss the Nine Dragon Screen, a very good photo op. I also really liked the Three-Story Opera Stage. There are also some exhibits inside the rooms of the Palace such as the room full of really amazing Clocks from the 18th and 19th century, Chinese and European. They also have huge intricate Jade carvings, jewelery and all sorts of items from the Palace's history. Take your time, enjoy the details and marvel at the fact that despite the thousands of visitors there with you, you can still find quiet corners with barely anyone around."
"Great places, but what is very annoying is the many tourguides with loudspeakers and microphone who create a lot of noice. This should be stopped by the management of this otherwise great place to visit."
"However, you must be prepared for long walk and competing with noisy tourists. There are many quiet routes in the park. If you enjoy quietness, you should avoid the main thoroughfare and go through side doors. Small kids will not enjoy the place as much as bigger ones.

Only part of the ground is open to the public. And the crowd is the largest in the morning. So please be prepared.

As I grew up in the city, I have been to this place numerous times. It is better to study the place well before you go and it is better to go independently without any tourist group so that you can enjoy all the things around.

I have always been amazed by the magnificent buildings. More recently, I have been thinking about how the emperors find their restrooms, because there were no restrooms at the time. While magnificent in nature, the Forbidden City is the ultimate prison for the most powerful."
"Even though it is cold in Beijing in winter, but it's the best time in this palace. The reason is less tourists here and I can really enjoy all the buildings and treasures. If you are student, you can get student discount as well. I think I PREFER traveling this palace in winter!!!"
"The forbidden city is surrounded by a river, and you can visit the hall of central harmony, the throne of the hall? The throne of the palace of heavenly purity, and differenta symbols of dragons"
"In a middle of the day it is very hot in summer and autumn, because not shadow! But it deserve for understand a small piece of China history!"
"It was a really neat experience, but I didn't enjoy it very much because of the crowds and the heat (I went in July). In hindsight, I should have gone during the week with less crowds. Unfortunately a lot of the exhibits were closed. My favorite part were the gardens, because the rest is all concrete. Although this is supposed to be one of the must-sees, Honestly I would have been ok not seeing this in hindsight."
"You can't visit Beijing and not visit the forbidden city. It's a place steeped in history and the traditional architecture is amazing. However, the buildings are not very well signposted and there is a lack of information throughout the exhibitions. It might be worth joining a tour or getting the audio guide in order to find out a bit more.
It's enormous and surprisingly easy to get lost - I needed to use a compass to find my way back from the Imperial Gardens - so make sure that you wear good shoes and take plenty of water.
Lots to see but the number of shops and food vendors made the place lack the feel these kind of historic places usually have. Overall it was a pleasant visit but one that left me slightly disappointed."
"I visited this today with my English speaking guide called Tony, who was excellent. He knew so much history about the Forbidden City.

It is a beautiful and peaceful experience when there aren't hundreds of thousands of visitors like during the national holidays.

I would highly recommend visiting and allowing a half day to do so."
Too many people. Not as much to see as I had imagined. I couldn't get a sense of the history. It was definitely a dead museum. But it's a place you can't miss. You can't visit Beijing and not see the forbidden city.
"Very historic, interesting to hear what happened here many many years ago. A good two hour walk through."
Being a history buff I was in my glory. Wow-the place is massive. The halls have been restored to their glory state. The place is amazing. I like going on some of the side passages and stand alone-you can feel the ghosts of the past. It is a photographers dream. so many photo-ops. The Thrown room is great. I enjoyed the Hall of Clocks. so much to see-you can take 2 days at least.
"Even though you may have seen pictures of the place it is still breathtaking to visit. The place is vast and for the photographer you can spend hours here.

It's right next to tiannamin square and you have no concept of how large it's going to be until you get through the first gate and then it just keeps on going.

It's must see if in Beijing. Even with crowds you can still find your own personal space and just take in the sheer splendour of it all"
"The palace is one of the main buildings inside the Forbidden City. Like anything else I did in Beijing, you must be prepared for large masses of people and some waiting. It is worth dealing with though to spend some time in this place."
This is a must see attraction. It is a huge complex and even with many tourists there's plenty of space. You can spend as much or as little time there as you like - I think we were there for about 2 hours. It's easy to get to by subway and to navigate with the audio guide. Ignore all the guides out the front and when inside look out for the 4 star toilets!
This place is huge. Wear comfortable shoes. We did hire a guide from one of the people outside the gate. We bargained for a better price. The guide was valuable as we had only 2 hours to get through the place and he moved us along. Very interesting.
"Forbidden City wasn't too far off from WangFuJing Street, 20-25 minutes walk. This palace is Hugh expect to spend at least two hours just walking from the front entrance to the back exit. Entrance fee is 40 RMB, translator device is available for foreigners for an additional, 50 RMB. Go during the weekdays as it is less crowded, Was blown away by the architecture and decoration of the palace. I was glad I didn't go with a tour as you can see more and don't have to worry about what time your group will leaving. most of the staff within speaks some English. Go early as the palace close around 5 or 6PM. September is the best month to visit these attractions in my opinion as the weather isn't too hot or cold (72 degree F / 22 degree C)"
"I visited the Forbidden city , really amazing place-the minimum is 1,5 hours to walk around .I was here in the afteroon-on the weekday it as not crowded at all.But thats difficult to tell when to go...
Definetly its a ""Must visit"" in Beijing, you can feel the magical atmosphere an the history all around."
The palace museum is actually part of the Forbidden City. The Forbidden City is enormous. It is sprawling with building after building with great photo taking opportunities. Until you see it you cannot imagine the size.
"A crowded but worthwhile visit. Make sure you venture to the left as you enter rather than follow the hordes of people straight ahead. There is a calligraphy and painting museum and it is just full of beautiful art. Because we were with a tour and had a designated meeting time, we had to rush at the end and did not get the chance to linger in the gardens. Make sure you do!"
"This huge complex is dead center in the city…it’s a must see in Beijing. The architecture is magnificent. Every little corner has amazing detail and so thoughtful. I know I may get some slack for this BUT I really don’t think you need a full day for this. I know, I’m lame haha. We were there for about 3 hours and saw A LOT. Much of what there is to see are the outside of buildings so it doesn’t take too long. We didn’t go to the gardens where the dragon screen is and I do regret that. Regardless, even if you’re there for 30 minutes you will see so much beauty.

Some tips…
-go early and stick to the ticket queues closest to the palace…they were empty for some reason while the ones further away were PACKED
-make friends with the staff at the info counter. They will help you figure out where to go and what you really want to see. We only had a few hours so they told us the main things we should focus on and a couple of other things based on our interests."
"The Palace Museum (The Forbidden City) was # 1 on our ""must see"" list for Beijing and what an amazing experience that was! If you're able to ignore the crowds and did some reading about it before getting there, you may be able to get a feeling of the greatness of China at that time or, better yet, of the amazing life in the emperor's city - The Forbidden City. You go through gate after gate and see amazing building after another amazing buliding and it goes on an on and you could spend there an entire day if you have the time and try to see and absorb everything.... Some of the buldings are like small museums, others are turned into interesting souvenir shops and all have an amazing architecture. I wouldn't miss it!"
"Whatever you have previously seen on TV or in magazines really does not prepare you for the sheer scale of the Forbidden City. From the impressive entrance, under the image of Chairman Mao, through courtyard, after courtyard, after courtyard, it is truly stunning.

The traditional architecture is wonderful and the carvings and intricate decoration quite beautiful.

We had our own guide, which we thought was the best way to see the best of what is on offer, although it is possible to pick up audio guides and do it yourself."
"Well, this is the real palace in existence and there are so many valuables and historical sites to see and explore. by far, the most influential museum in China which has the most extensive collection of historical treasures."
"This place was very cool to visit. However, be prepared for a huge crowd and lots of pushing. There is no sense of personal space whats so ever, and if you aren't paying attention, you'll get an elbow from a 70 year old man shoving you out of his way. You also need to make sure you are with someone that can tell you what is going on."
"We visited the Forbidden City on a Sunday and that was a bad decision. We were there at 9am and there was already a sea of people entering the palace. Many domestic tourist groups and school groups were there and to be honest, those tour guides speaking loudly through their microphones at the same time spoilt the experience quite a bit.

The queue to buy tickets was thankfully, very short (since we were there early) and we got audio guides as well (¥40 for English). I found the audio guides quite unhelpful. They start off automatically based on a gps detection system but mine always start early and rattled off information before I even got near the site. Worse of all, the audio guide will get cut off in the middle of a sentence and there was no way to get it to restart. I also realised that 90% of the information given by the audio guide is the same as those on the info board. So there is really no point getting one.

The best decision we made was to buy another ticket and enter the Antiquarium on the east side of the Forbidden city. It only cost us ¥10 and we were able to get away from the suffocating mob. The ticket allowed us to access quite an extensive area, including some exhibitions of ancient stone drums and ""treasures of the forbidden city"" (not very magnificient to be honest, if you have been to the Palace Museum in Taipei where all the real treasures are housed). The real treat was the HUGE and beautifully carved jade carvings in Cixi's room (too heavy for the KMT to move to Taiwan, I suppose). The mini garden built for Qianlong when he retired was also nice and tranquil (NO CROWDS!)

We had to backtrack back to the entrance of the Antiquarium because the tour of that part of the palace brought us very far north, almost to the exit and we wanted to see everything. There were small exhibitions hidden in the alleyways between the middle section and the east section so I was glad that we backtracked. You'll miss a lot of things when you just walk straight through the middle section of the Forbidden city.

Do wear comfortable shoes because the forbidden palace is huge (we spent 4 hours ++) and visit Jingshanpark (right opposite the north exit) to get a paroramic view of the whole palace."
"So huge yet so beautiful... a walk-through to the Chinese grandeur history... It was a 4-hour long and tiring walk, but was worth every effort. China has a rich past, and it showed in the relics and sections of this palace.

I accessed the Forbidden City through its north gate from the Imperial Gardens. Entrance fee was CY60 and I rented the audio guide (CY40) so I will know the features of each section. Pretty informative and you dont need a tour guide anymore and you have all the time you want to focus on your favorite sections."
We got to the Forbidden City at 4 pm - 1 hour before closing - but we were able to walk around and take great pictures inside. I was wondering why there were no furniture inside the palace - but a local guide said that they were removed and brought to a museum. We didn't have enough time to see the other buildings around the compound but just to be in the place where only a privileged few were allowed long time ago was enough. The crowds starting leaving and around 4:45 pm - the place was almost empty which was good to take lots of photos.
"This place just conjures up images of what life would have been like for Chinese emperors. Do read up a bit on the history of the Chinese emperors and you'll be rewarded. Keep in mind the air may be quite smoggy and you'll want to bring a bottle of water, the site will take some time to visit."
I first visited the palace museum in 1998 and was blown away by it. Visiting it again now when so much has been renovated was even better. Expect the walk through to take a long time - there is so much to see -but it is definitely worth the effort
"I was amazed on how big the Palace grounds are (I found out later that the whole Palace area is 160 acres) and we had to do a lot of walking and luckily for us the weather was nice. We walked through many court yards and we lost court how many court yards we pass through. It is important to go with a tour guide who will explain the main buildings to you, as all the building are empty or locked up and there is not much English signages explaining each of the building. You can easier spend the whole day, exploring the whole Palace. This palace easier beats Gyeongbokgung Palace (Seoul, Korea) in terms of Palace grounds size and number of buildings. If you visit this Palace, there is no need to visit other Chinese Palaces, apart from the Summer Palace which has a fantastic view of the surrounding lake."
"It needs to be b the must see list, but after seeng rows and rows of the same thing, you might have seen enough. But when you do exit from the north gate, you will be rewardedby an amazing Jingshan park with more beautiful temples from which you see when walking through Forbidden City. However if you exit from the north gate, you will have to walk back 2 miles to the entrance if you need to otherwise there are taxis there."
"These are some amazing grounds. The architecture is fantastic and the immense space is tough to fathom. These grounds put most of the other Palace footprints I've seen to shame. The condition is being improved but remains excellent. We could spend all day just exploring the Gardens, but by the crowds, so could everyone else.

Advice from my spouse: Ladies, if you don't want to wait a long time in the loo-queue, plan on bringing your own ""roll"" and copping a squat - five minute wait in the Asian queue, twenty-minute wait in the western queue."
This was a surprisingly large group of buildings with so much history attached. Found it to be stark with no greenery. The scale of it was mind boggling considering its age.
"If you saw 'The last emperor' you may be disappointed. Rows of almost empty buildings, all alike, over a huge area... Quite exhausting in a hot day. The entrance in the south and exit in the north make you walk miles whether you like it or not. It is difficult not to go to, but - as above - doesn't leave you breathless... A tour with a tour guide may be more interesting - at least you will hear some worth-knowing facts and figures."
outside there was many people trying to be your tour guide but this is not needed we had a lonely planet book which had a very good guide of what to look at. We bought tickets outside and wandered in. It is very spacious inside despite the crowds of tourists. Many different building to look at gardens and some extra expeditions if your interested. It was a hot day when we went so water was needed but well worth visiting.
"We visited the Forbidden City as part of a tour group. The crowds, mostly Chinese, were large, but you only had to move about 10 metres either side of the centre line of the complex and you could have the place almost to yourself. Because the place is so big and everyone has to walk the full length of it (enter one end, exit the other), almost everyone stays close to the shortest path through. Major buildings on the centre line are crowded beyond belief - everywhere else you could look around with almost nobody else around.

The buildings and grounds are impressive, but many of the buildings have minimal furnishings.

We had lunch in a cafe off to one side somewhere near the centre of the complex - not bad, and prices were quite reasonable.

This not a easy site if you have mobility issues."
"From Tiananmen Square we walked to The Forbidden City. Our guide gave us several hours time to explore it and you probably need to spend the better part of a day to do it justice. The size of the area is huge and there is so much to see (at least 8 palaces and halls). The architecture is magnificent and the history is very interesting. Along with The Great Wall, The Terra Cotta Warriors this would be something that you would want to visit multiple times."
"While it was fantastic to walk through a place where once only Emperor's walked, this historical treasure isn't kept up as well as some other older landmarks in Beijing, like the Lama Temple. It is absolutely worth a visit, though. I loved the statues and the general architecture. I wish we could enter more buildings, but I understand why we cannot. The gardens were also beautiful. Go early to avoid the crowds, and I mean early."
Much like any place in China there are swarms of people everywhere but this is a massive area with many places to explore. Granted the temples get redundant after a while but there are still many interesting things to see. The garden is quite lovely and I liked how the figures on the corners of the temples display their importance by how many figures there are. Bring sunscreen if the sun manages to break through the pollution and comfortable walking shoes because the walkway stones hurt after so many hours.
"The Forbidden City is a fantastic location, but nothing can prepare you for the sheer scale of the place, even knowing that there are 999 rooms in advance does nothing to help!
There are long queues to enter and airport scanner type security (though bypassed by our tour group!) which can be slow to move. Once inside, the crowds have plenty space to spread out, but there are many bottlenecks where the crowds are channelled through openings. There is little shade in the Forbidden City, with lots of bare stone paving (which can be hard to walk on), so bring plenty water, though there are stalls selling water (approx. £1 for 3 bottles, so not overpriced) as the summer heat can be overbearing. While you can get right up to the various buildings within the complex, entry to the individual buildings is not possible and a scrum can develop around the open doorways to try and see inside.
The buildings are in good repair and the details of the buildings (particularly on the roofs) are amazing, when you consider the age and exposed nature of the location.
We were lucky in that our tour group had arranged for our bus to pick us up at the back of the Forbidden City as the attraction is primarily seen as a one way passage, rather than returning back to the start, so a long walk back to Tiananmen Sqare if not picked up."
This is such a big place you need half a day to visit . Start early esp if you go in there summer. It was a fantastic place . go during the week if possible as it is still crowed but weekends would be even worse . We had a tour as you learnt the history of the place . Take water with you as well plus camera for lots of amazing shots
"Not all that keen to visit museums, but this a standout highlight for any traveller. Try it and and you'll not regret."
"If you appreciate history and love to admire design and architecture this is definitely a must see in China. Even just to see the sheer size of the Forbidden City, thinking back on how long it must have taken and the amount of people required to build such an amazing city.

We decided to wing it and forgo either a guide or an audio guide, not even taking a map. In hindsight I think this was a bit of a mistake as I believe we may have missed seeing a few areas. At the very least do a little bit of reading prior to visiting (we didn't get a chance to do this either) as I think it will help you appreciate even more what you see in front of you.

The only negative was the amount of tourists, just like most of the other major attractions we visited in China. Therefore sometimes it is hard to get a good look at things and you will find that the tour group guests are quite pushy and have no hesitations in bumping you out of the way as they are zooming their way through the many sites of Beijing.

We went in the afternoon hoping to avoid some of the bigger crowds however unfortunately this didn't work in our favor. Some others may have better luck!

It was lovely to see the Imperial Garden at the north end of the city as it does start to get a bit dull looking at all of the buildings in their shades of red and grey. Such a beautiful place to stop near the end of your time at the Forbidden City and quietly reflect (if you're lucky) on the sheer amount of hard work that would have gone into creating a now wonderful piece of history for China."
"Be prepared for lots and lots of people for this attraction but well worth a visit. Be prepared to walk everywhere - and the place is really big. Queues were ok around 11 - they were moving so didnt wait too long. You do get approached by people leading into the city offering to be your tour guide but just say no as the audio is sufficient. The audio is quite handy as it operates on a GPS system so when you move through the palace it will tell you a bit about the area you are in at the time. The audiobooks are in different languages too - mine was English for 40 yuan. Entry fee was 60. And you pay extra for the museum of treasures/ hall clock gallery. I think both are worth a look. Food is pricey inside so do what I did...took my own lunchbox. After the 4 hours inside and tired of the crowds, I took haven at Oasis cafe for a cheesecake and ice coffee and sent some emails using their free wifi. They are located in shops across the road at the second set of lights once you exit the palace to your right."
"The biggest queue we found ourselves in on the day we visited The Forbidden City was the one leading up to the security checkpoint opposite Tiananmen Square. It was only our second day in China, so we were still finding our feet and weren't at all sure we were even in the right place! Still, we shuffled along with everyone else and eventually found ourselves at the main entrance. Buy your tickets at the kiosks on the left hand side as you go in and don't listen to the touts that try and persuade you that the queue will take an hour - it was busy when we were there and still only took 5 minutes.

The Palace itself is huge, sprawling over a big chunk of land. This is a good thing, as it thins out the thousands of visitors a bit. There is plenty to see, even though the majority of the buildings are off limits to the public. The palaces were closed when we were there, perhaps due to the fears over visitor numbers. Even so, we filled the better part of a day ambling around the various buildings, passageways and gardens. Some of the architecture is fascinating and the scale is very impressive."
"Must visit. Be prepared to walk a lot. It's impossible to see all exhibits inside in one day. Choose before what you want to see, than go. Wheelchairs are offered at Tourist Information close to ticket office. We needed one for one person in our party. Deposit of 500 yuan. Check if it works ok before you go. There is a special path marked for wheelchairs, but it keeps you from seeing the great halls. And the special route can still be quite uneven in places. Otherwise, it's fantastic to see the greatnes of the empire and how life must have been then"
"When we got there, we found there to be quite a lot of the usual ""tour guides"" hanging aroud the ticket queues.

It was difficult to know if they were official or not so instead, we opted to go in and get the audio guide which I thought was pretty good.

The city itself was really busy and it has lot of empty buildings with a lot of people trying to take photos so be prepared to spend a bit of time waiting to see what you want to see.

The audio guide gives you suggested routes round the city and the suggested routes vary in time.

I'd say this is a must see but only if you are prepared for a lot of people to be around. I don't suspect this would be an enjoyable place for younger kids especially in the summer months but we both enjoyed it and we're glad that we went."
"This is one of the historical place must visit if you are in Beijing. Those who are appreciate China Emperor history you will appreciate the museum, just like bringing the history to live, especially those who have watched some movie about the emperor. My husband didn't know the history of China and he didn't really appreciate that and for him just an ancient museum, but we do appreciate the architecture of the palace, and it is huge and amazing.

We rented the English Automatic Guide (you can choose your own language), it is with sensor and explain to you the history of every part of the palace that you enter in, we feel the Automatic Guide is good enough for us. If you are someone that really into history, I suggest you hire a personal tour guide, they are many waiting at the ticketing area, you might need to book them in advance if you need other language besides Chinese and English. The personal tour guide is good because you can ask personal questions in details regarding the history of the palace.

Be prepared the museum is very crowded and full of tourist, you might need to wait or have difficulty to see some part of the museum, taking picture will be challenging as well.

For me, this is one of the place should visit if you are first time in Beijing, but I won't visit again in the future."
"Visiting the old Forbidden City and Tiananmen Square is a must-do in Beijing. It's huge and full of interesting history about how the Emperor, his 3,000 comcubines and eunuchs lived. There isn't much to see inside the buildings but it's worth going just to appreciate how immense it is and what it must have been like to live during those times."
"I know it's called the National Palace Museum, but people should know that it is now a shallow place while everything precious worth seeing in it were now moved to Taiwan."
It's always worth a visit...but I don't think they make this the experience they could. Not suggesting Disneyworld but they could give you a better feel for life in the palace.
"The Forbidden City really is incredible; it's an enormous complex, and the Emperor, royal family, palace staff and concubines spent their entire lives here, and no-one else was allowed in or out. The buildings are beautiful, although some are looking a bit shabby now. Try and get a map, either a paper one, or the audio guide (which is very good - 40RMB) is a map itself, as the site is just too big to do without out - you'll end up missing most of it. Highlights are definitely anything on the central line between the entrance and exit gates and the Nine Dragon Screen, but their are gems everywhere. And you really can't complain with the 60RMB entrance fee.

While it is still a must-see, when we went (peak season), the place was so packed with tourists that it detracted from the majesty of it all; it was hard to imagine how it was under the Emperor when literally thousands of tourists milled around. Try and get there as early as possible - 8.30am-4.30pm are the opening hours. Also, the place is literally so big that even I, who have a large appetite for wondering around historical sites, couldn't take in anymore after 5 hours, and I saw about two thirds of the site. Try and also bring your own lunch, as all the food inside is expensive and not very nice.

The Forbidden City is definitely a must-see in Beijing, and it is incredible to be in the seat of imperial power in China for centuries - just be warned it is enormous and the crowds can get ridiculous! It's also a good idea to combine spending half an hour or so wondering around Tiananmen Square before hand as the square is directly in front of the Forbidden city."
"I thought this was spectacular. I see that some people commented that there is too much ""more of the same"". I think they may have not tried hard enough to explore all the sections. There are hidden gems throughout that aren't in the central areas. I highly recommend the clock museum. I wore out my trusty travel companion. She was limping by the end of the day. But I feel we saw every inch."
"I would go as early as possible.

Go through the main entrance & work with the flow of traffic. Be prepared to be jostled."
"Is really great to see all the history, we made it all like in 1 hour without a guide so if you're going is good if you take a guide or maybe the electronic guide because you can reed some of the history inside but is not the same!"
"But its all same, same in each area and gets repetivite. Don't need to spend too long here unless you have the time to spare"
"Hard to imagine what this amazing place was like in the past, when access was severely restricted, simply because the vast numbers of people visiting the Forbidden City, on any one day, is phenomenal. That said; use your imagination as you progress from the ‘front’ to the ‘back’ and it is an amazing site! Right through to the ‘lovers’ tree and the man made ‘mountain’ at the back, where residents of the Forbidden City could sit, hidden, and watch the outside word...incredible!
By the way, we were photographed nearly as much as the attractions - apparently 'western tourists' are a novelty to some of the Chinese people visiting Beijing from elsewhere in the country."
There's nothing left to see other than the buildings. The crowds are unbelievable. Even the exhibitions (other than clocks) have nothing special to offer.
So much history together! Bring time to walk and patience. It is a nice llace to visit. But it is sure no good place to go with a baby stroller. You will need to carry it as some places are only stairs or the holes in the floor will not let you go forward
"An amazing experience, enter by the South Gate where you buy your ticket ( 60 yuans), be prepared to be pushed in the queue! Absolutely fabulous, it took us a good five hours to see most of it. The crowd are big but the place is so gigantic that you don't feel it is so crowded. We had lunch inside, it was OK, just don't buy Western products, they are too expensive!!!
The visit is an absolute must. Such ancient history."
"It offers a wide range of objects and artifacts but it is a bit time consuming and tiring to go through all those exhibition halls/ rooms, particularly if you go there on certain days and during festivals. You could be annoyed not only by the maddening crowd but also the din produced there."
"Quite extraordinary. So many wonderful buildings, and fascinating history. Had a private guide - well worth the cost - so much better than group tour."
"The Forbidden City is one of those places I longed to see but never dreamed I would. The scale of the palace complex is huge and the mixture of grand open squares, maze-like alleyways and secluded gardens is overwhelming. We ate in the cafe within the Forbidden CIty - good value and excellent food."
"Despite the crowds of people this is a place we will always remember, We couldn't stop admiring the beautiful buidings one after the other."
"The entrance area is a bit confusing with the crowds but I wasn't aware that the Palace Museum was the same thing as the Forbidden City. Or at least within it. So you must buy the tickets to the ""Palace Museum"" at the entrance and just follow the crowds in. There are small museums on the side of the main areas so stop in those if you have time. It is also a way to cool off for a bit bec there is very little shaded areas as you walk thorough. There were a lot of people when I went around 11am but the place is so massive that you don't really feel it too much. I still suggest going a bit earlier, also because of the August heat. When you exit, Jingshan Park is directly across the street for you to get a beautiful view of the Forbidden City from up high."
"Before coming here I had not expectation whatsoever of what I was going to see; I basically went because it was recommended to me. I must say that I was really amazed by it, the place is huge and beautiful; totally worth it! It opens at 830am so plan to get early since it can get really busy, literally thousands of people! Plus during summer it can get really hot and humid."
"Its the biggest Palace in the World its soaked in history and if your in Beijing its a must.

To enjoy at its best use a tour guide you learn lots about the building and its history. The buildings go on and on it really is amazing.

On one of the exits children get an opportunity to dress up in authentic Chinese costumes its a bit chaotic but fun.

The palace museum is one of the most famous locations in China. Sometimes the Palace Museum is very crowded. I would recommend to visit the Museum early in the morning. If you go through the area without an insider you will miss many important details. I would recommed to gather some information before you go there or bring an insider who can explain the history and the details of the museum.
"The place is pretty awesome. Just like the movies. You need a guide (200 rmb), or to rent the audio guide (40 rmb). Otherwise, you miss the whole story.
We went to see the last emperor's nephew at the end of the tour, who is now calligraphist. Ok, we were fully having fun with this notion of a tourist trap. But it turns out, the artwork is pretty. The setting magical, and we were happy to haggle with this ""descendant of royalty"". He made us a very nice piece of calligraphy for our anniversary trip.
Also, there is a pagoda on top of a hill I recommend. You get a panoramic view of the forbidden city. This is across the street from the north side. You pay 2rmb to get in. The gardens are beautiful. The view spectacular. At the back of the garden is where you find the calligraphist."
"This is definitely a must-see-attraction in Beijing, but you should visit there just in case you have plenty of time, because it is very very large, and very crowded. I have just visited there this August, and the entrance fee is 60 yuan (Chinese currency). I spent more than 4 hours to visit most of places in the Palace Museum, except the Supreme Hall of Harmony and Hall of Clock, they were temporarily closed at that time. Please keep in mind that sometimes you can not enter some places because they are being closed for some reason.

My recommendation is, you can pay more 40 yuan for renting an audio guide (an electronic device). There are many languages available, and you can change the language manually during your trip. It is integrated with a GPS, so whenever you come to an attraction in Palace Museum, the corresponding guide information will be automatically turn on. I tried with Vietnamese and English and their quality were quite good. This device provided me with many interesting information about the Chinese history, life of the emperors and their family, and it is very convenient because I can replay it anytime.

One of the most interesting parts of the Palace Museum is the Treasure Gallery, so please don't hesitate to pay more 10 yuan for admission fee to enter here. It is far less crowded than other zone in the Palace Musemum (because it cost additional 10 yuan to enter, maybe ^^) You can see the most perfect Nine Dragon Wall, a replica of Supreme Hall or Harmony with emperor's throne here (a little smaller than the original one but no crowd, no noise, so you are free to take photo). In addition, you can see very precious jewelries of the royal family in the museum inside the Treasure Gallery.

Before visiting the Palace Museum, please check this site http://www.dpm.org.cn/shtml/2/@/8797.html - it has many useful information for your trip."
"This is a must see attraction in Beijing. Just across the boulevard from Tieneman Square, the Forbidden City (Palace Museum) is an incredible set of buildings, moats, and courtyards that has to be seen in person. The movie ""The Last Emperor"" lis a good introduction to this attraction, but nothing beats an in-person visit."
The Forbidden city and square need to be visited to appreciate the size and scale of the place. A guide is a prerequisite to explain what is going on and steer a path through the crowds. The history is incredible and the buildings awesome but our experience was coloured by tow of our party being pick pocketed there.
"This and the Great Wall are spectacular sites which you should not miss. During our weekend visit in August, the crowds were enormous and took away some of the enjoyment but the complex is very large so there are areas where the crowds can spread out. There are security checks with long lines. A guide would be helpful in explaining the history and significance of the site, as well as steering you to various highlights."
"The Forbidden City is a vast complex at the very heart of Beijing. It is the largest palace in the world and the visit is worth several hours if you really want to properly explore it.

Saying that it is monumental is not even close to it. The Palace is so big that you can easily get lost in it. So, as suggested by many reviewers before, do buy the map at the entrance (or at any of the other main attractions, such as the Temple of Heaven) (it should cost you 5-10 RMB). It is both a souvenir and a useful map. In any case, please have in mind that the palace is arranged so that the main halls are in the center line, south to north, while gardens, parks, exhibitions are east or west.

Access to the Palace takes some time, as car stopping is not allowed in the surroundings, so you will have to walk either from East or West Tiananmen metro stations or from the south end of the very Tiananmen Square. Remember that here in China, your bags are inspected anytime to enter the metro or any other main public attraction, so do expect long queues when crossing the square, when crossing the streets, when entering the palace...

We came here in August, when the Palace is probably most crowded, so everything was confusion. Just to give some hints to the travelers, when you cross the first gate (Tiananmen Gate) you come across a huge area where you will see probably many food stalls and queues. Those on the left are to visit the gate. Move on and cross the South Gate and you will find probably the same panorama, lots of people, stalls, no clear signs. Go straight and look on the left. The ticket office to the Palace is around there, with some 15 windows.

Having said the basics, I would add now my personal opinion. The Palace is really impressive, yes, beautiful, inspiring, romantic, many possitive adjectives can be put together to describe the Palace. But I personally found it also a little bit overvalued. From the architectural point of view, the style of all buildings is pretty similar and for a foreigner that, together with the so many similar names of the halls and lack of contents in them tend to confuse. There are exceptions, yes, for instance, inside the Treasure, but the general feeling is that everything is the same. The good point of it is that you can grasp the experience of the old days very easily, as you can wander around and get lost alone (if you come in winter, of course). The main beautiful roofs and walls are a delight of a photographer, though finding something original might be a tough challenge. The Treasure itself is really disappointing. Sorry for that, but the displays are dirty, most close to the wall, so limiting the access to them, the lighting is terrible, and the contents are surprisingly far less significant or less awesome that one can expect in such a place beforehand. Instead of a treasure it looked a shaggy decayed collection. I would not even mention the lack of non-Chinese labels or indications, which make the visit less interesting. In essence, nothing to do with the Shanghai Museum, which is clean, ordered, well lit and generally a delight.

For a complete visit you would spend here many hours, not just 2 or 3 like I have read. But to make the visit more satisfactory, go up the Jingshan Park in front of the North gate for an aerial view of the complex."
"I enjoyed my time there. Everything is just like in the movies, there's so much history everywhere you look, it's like you're in another world. I went on a Sunday afternoon and there weren't that many people, so don't fear going at the weekend. A lot of museum shops selling beautiful vases and plates (if you're interested, they range between 90-250 rmb)"
"The security lines to enter the grounds are very long and will take you between 1-1.5 hours in the summer. Upon entering the grounds, there are many fascinating cultural things to see from ancient China. I recommend bringing your camera to take photos of the various sites on the Museum Grounds."
I'm not sure where else you can find something like the Forbidden City so for that reason alone it is worth the visit.
"Visited last May. A childhood dream to see the ""Forbidden City"" having studied the Palace and the sad but enigmatic life of the last Emperor of China Puyi. Built during the 1350's (Ming Dynasty) it is still the worlds largest palace complex and was for the sole use of the Emperors - it was forbidden for anyone else to enter for 500 years. There are trees in the palace garden with coloured bands and they are 300-500+ years old. So many things to see in this vast stone complex. The outer area and steps were ceremonial, the inner the Royal living area. We got there early and stayed all day. Lots of places to get a drink and snacks. Inside the palaces is a little slow moving - amazing to see the Emperors throne and to see the inner chamber where the child Emperor held court whispered to by the Empress Dowager hidden behind a screen - not a nice lady. Way too much to mention. Try and look it up online and plan where you want to go ahead of the crowds. Look out for the fascinating feng shui - auspicious red -.yellow etc - use of water and round gates. The library is the only building with a black roof representing water to reflect waters power to dowse fire. Fabulous buildings and grounds. Yes queues inside but not so bad. There really is something here to interest everyone. I very highly recommend this as a must see in Beijing."
"A large palace with 9,999 rooms, but after you've seen a portion of it and learned where the emperors quarters were, where the concubines stayed, and seen a few of the treasurers, that's about it."
"Priced at either 60Y for regular admission or 20Y for students it's worth bringing your student ID! It can be pretty crowded during the main part of the day and you will get hot in the summer going from building to building. It would be easy to spend an entire day here if you strolled along slowly but if short on time it's not entirely necessary. My best advice is to be wary when buying water and food. Due to the heat in summer you may feel the need to buy a water bottle immediately when you starting feeling thirsty but walk another ten feet and you can often find more official dealers selling water at half the price of the sketchy dealers. I'd recommend bringing your own liter in summer as you will definitely drink it! Also be prepared to push your way through crowds for photos and if you're a Westerner to have plenty of pictures taken of you and with you. Oh and one last thing, bring your own toilet paper if you think you might need it!"
having heard so much what a great thing to see and touch this fantastic place its such a cultural impact to see this sight
Summer lines are about 1+ hours to get thru security bag xray and searching. (aka Airport TSA) Summer lines for tickets could also approach 1 hour. Then you get to stand in line another 30 minutes to file into The Palace Museum. But you can bypass all most of this if you enter thru the East Glorious Gate after touring the Beijing Peoples Workers Cultural Palace AND hire a translator-licensed tour guide. Inside is amazing and to picture it being built 600 years ago. Bring good walking shoes.
"The place could have been looked after a little bit better. Especially the small palaces on the East and West. It is a pity that the Throne is now had smell of dusty and musky smell. Considering the amount of people that goes through each year, the government should preserve this historical place."
Home of 500 years of emperors. A spectacular place. Try to get a tour guide who will take you to the clock collection which has many magnificent pieces.
"Royal palace, a must to visit for foreigners and local visitors. The only cons is, that place is always crowded."
"Like many attractions in Beijing and within China in general, there will be large crowds wherever you go, especially in the summer time. But the Palace Museum (or the Forbidden City) particularly draws massive crowds for its historical importance, world fame and iconic shots. At just 60RMB for admission ticket, it is probably one of the best value historical attractions in the world.

It is a colossal palace, with many sections branching off from the large, main road that serves as the central axis for essentially the entire city. It is also a historically significant place, so if you're a history buff or at least have an interest in Chinese history, by all means do visit here.

One thing that I wish I did before visiting was to read a little bit about the Forbidden City and its role throughout Chinese history. Having a background knowledge would have helped me appreciate the palace more, and maybe even not mind the clamoring crowds as much.

Overall, definitely worth the visit."
"You can touch the palace and 'feel' the history! Every part of the palace was full of stories and it would be perfect if travellers could read related history books before visiting! We learned that the palace is full of history, science, aesthetics and wisdom."
The palace museum is filled with exquisite pieces of artwork. Lots of gilded artifacts and impressive pieces. You cannot cover the place in matter of minutes because its huge and there is a whole lot of stuff to see and learn. So be prepared with ample time devoted to the palace itself and make sure you have comfortable shoes for all the walking and climbings.
"Stunning place. Really beautiful buildings especially the roofs. Look out for the animals....odd numbers in order to protect the building. The earth from the moat was used to make a man made hill at the back for feng shui purposes. You have to have a mountain at the back and water at the front. Each gate leads to an even more spectacular one. Keep your eyes peeled formthe genuine certified 4 star toilets! Once you get to the most impresive bit, it ends quite abruptly and it is a bit like leaving via the back door. Allow a good few hours for your visit. You can get food and drink inside and despite what your guide may tell you, it is reasonably priced. The whole site is vast and although crowded you will be able to find any quiet corners. What struck me was the expanse of stone. I was expecting grass but there was not much which made it look quiet spartan in parts. If you are in Beijing, this is a must see."
"Well, I have to say the Palace Museum is my most wanted to visit destination when I went to Beijing. It was really a grand museum and it took us 5 hours to finish our visit. Visiting the Palace Museum is really a great chance to get close to ancient Chinese history and culture, especially the imperial history. We hired a private tour guide, who was really helpful to get us understand more about this museum. She told me a lot of stories about this place and this made our visit quite interesting. The architecture and buildings are really magnificent inside this museum. Well, but you really have to prepare a pair of comfortable shoes if you want a comfortable trip."
"The incredible extension of the palace itself is quite impressive, and that is just the start. It is quite hard to describe the magnitude and beauty of its structures, and even harder to talk about its gardens. The history those walls enclose is very interesting, and you can´t say you´ve been to Beijing if you didn´t check this out!!!!"
"This is undoubtedly one of the top attractions in Beijing but for me it gets 4 stars rather than 5 because once you have walked through 2 or 3 gates into the second or third vast enclosure it all looks a bit similar. But still worth it to get a feel for the peculiarly beyond-extravagant 'private' world of the old emperors. We approached from the NE corner of Tiananmen Square (from the direction of Wanfujing) and were initially met with a very long slow moving queue which was just a security screening to get to the North side of Tiananmen Square. This was during the Chinese summer holiday season. A guy offered to be our guide and promised that he could get us through multiple queues in 5 minutes whereas it would take us a few hours on our own. I didn't like the look of him and sensed some gross exaggeration. I was right. Altogether we spent about 35 minutes in queues. When we entered the first gate of the palace, near the ticket offices, there were many more guides offering their services and I picked a more friendly looking one. She took some ticket money from us and got us our tickets via a fast-track queue for guides. Of course I kept an eye on her. Anyway, we were very pleased with our guide - I think she charged about Y300 for 90 minutes. We liked her company and had a cheap lunch with her afterward in a nearby hutong."
"So much history in one area, go with a guide for best experience possible. They can be arranged for you at the gate"
"Crowded, very hot during summer, u need at least 3 hours to visti all of it + 1 hour for visiting the Clocks and Treasure expo.
Cost ( 60 yuan entrance+ 40 yuan Electronic Tour Guide + 10 yuan for Treasures expo+ 10 Yuan for Clocks expo). But it Worth it!!"
Spectacular architecture. Massive! Be prepared for lots and lots of walking! Not an ideal place for small children. Being July it was hot and busy. We walked straight through but it still took hours. The garden is beautiful and our 3 and 5 year olds enjoyed finding various animal statues. We were stopped a lot for photographs of our children here making it hard to keep moving. Definitely worth seeing.
"Before visiting Beijing I was told that the two things I must see were the Great Wall and Forbidden City. Visiting the Forbidden City in July is not the best idea but was the only opportunity we had, it was extremely hot and there were crowds of people everywhere, you will struggle to get photos without people in them. It is fascinating, like most Beijing historical sites, the grandeur of the Palace. It is amazing that something so large was built for one person and forbidden for anyone else to enter. One disappointment I found (which I didn’t know beforehand) was you are not allowed to enter any of the buildings and can only view through dusty windows and ropes. All of the buildings in the Forbidden City look exactly the same so it felt as though I was seeing the same thing over and over again. The same design is found at the Summer Palace, temple of heaven and Jiangsu Park however there is a degree of variety between buildings at these other locations.
It is a beautiful place you have to see but choose your day carefully."
"Visited Peking the 12 of March 1972, just a before Nixon. It was a lot to se and to remember. Bad that I didn’t have a camera with me as it was just stunning."
There were a lot of people at the Forbidden City. Sometimes you need to line up for a few hours just to buy a ticket! We bought our tickets online so we got in pretty quickly. The place takes a long time to explore. We took about 3 hours there. We weren't even done exploring when we left. It's a fascinating place but it gets kind of boring sometimes because everything looks the same and you start getting dizzy.
"The Forbidden City is an enormous area so be prepared for a lot of walking - made more difficult because of the thousands of other tourists all doing the same as you. As you go in guides will offer their services or just inside the first gate you can rent an audio guide that was pretty good once you got the hang of it. In some ways the palace is disappointing because it just seems you are passing one building after another after another. But the atmosphere does improve once you reach the inner sanctum and as part of that the museum which houses many of the treasures from the Qing dynasty. This costs extra to get in but you do see bronzeware, jade, paintings, ceramics and some personal palace artifacts .... would have loved to take those two diamond rings home with us. Also check out the garden with its wonderful rock formations"
"I think I'm biased because I didn't like Beijing as a whole, it was dirty and crowded and had no redeemable appeal to me and I felt the same about this palace. I've been to a lot of temples and palaces around Asia which are 100 times nicer than this one. My 3/5 is comparing it to other palaces I've seen but if you're already in Beijing, you may as well visit here because it's nicer than some of the other places to visit but don't come to Beijing just for this! It's massively overrated. Japan and Korea have much nicer palaces - maybe China has other nicer places too, I can only speak for Beijing."
A fascinating place but very large and monotonous with no context. For a lightweight introduction watch The Last Emperor first. There is a significant amount of history here so some kind if guide is essential.
"And you'd think of wealth inequality, you'll have to give this palace a visit. The palaces of European royalty have nothing on the grandeur of this place. There's even an imperial garden inside which is impressive in itself. Just be wary of the throngs of people that come visit every year. Entrance is 60 yuan but well worth the adventure through one of the most extravagant houses in the world."
"I visited the forbidden city as part of my intrepid tour. I have to say I was disappointed, it just seems like loads of building in different courtyards, which you cannot be sure are old or not, no buildings open to go inside, and incredibly hot when I went in July, and the most people crammed into one place I've ever experienced, completely spoilt it for me."
"The forbidden city itself is a more than impressive place and everyone who has the chance should go. The museum itself does not live up to the high expectations this extraordinary place suggests. It is build for mass tourism and with no eye for details. The audio tour was ok, but as well not especially great or well detailed."
"It’s the culmination of the trip – visit to the Forbidden Palace. The culture and the history of China all comes together here. For centuries foreigners were not allowed to step foot inside the palace, and being here now is awe-inspiring. Come early as the lines can get pretty long."
"The history, culture, scenery...just so much information it can be overwhelming.

The museum and the Forbidden City itself are just part of the cities treasures."
Why else would you come to Beijing. We got a nice guide of the side entrance which bypasses all the gates from Tinamin Square (near moat)- well misses all the shops and throngs. But it is crowded at least this place is huge and YOU MUST GO THERE.
"Slightly embarrassed that this happened to me as I consider myself a seasoned traveler. 18 countries, some multiple times in the last year and a lot of tuk tuk / rickshaw rides. Thought best to share my experience, but will not add to reviews of the Palace (which was very good)

Got to the end of the site, and you end up at the rear of the Palace. Waited 15 minutes for a bus that takes you back to the front for I think around 2 yuan. So eventually gave up and started walking, although thinking that this would take ages and waste time

Started my walk and a rickshaw driver said for 3 he will take me to the front of the Palace. I get in, we quickly divert off the main road and down a side alley. He said the front is around the corner and wants payment. I give 3 yuan, he says no - 300 yuan! We get into an argument in this alley, I give him 100 and say that is all I have. For a minute I thought it would resort into a physical confrontation - anyway, I walked off and was fine

Shame as this experience ruined a great morning"
"This is definitely one of the must sees in Beijing. We had an English speaking tour guide, who explained some of the fascinating history surrounding this huge palace. This was the home of 24 emperors, which date back to the 15th century. The architecture and the attention to detail is truly stunning. Be prepared for large crowds!"
"That is the famous forbidden city! Plan to spend at least 3 to 4 hours there. Line to buy tickets may be long, but do not worry because it goes fast. Is summer, take an umbrella!"
"Put this on your attraction list its amazing. Best thing you can do is take a guide be careful not one of those shonky ones that take your money and run there are plenty of those hanging round outside.Also make sure you get one that speaks English
Avoid taking rickshaw rides in this area we got taken to a back alley robbed and left there stressful"
"This experience was fabulous! The size of the palace museum was simply astounding! The gardens were beautiful, whilst the design of the rooftops were elaborate and the entire layout totally impressive. I would recommend visiting Jing Shan Park to witness an impressive view over the whole of the Forbidden City, which is particularly fascinating when juxtaposed with the modern sky scrapers which surround it. The Palace Museum was brilliant value for money at 60 yuan and the park was only 10 yuan.
However, I would warn that there were a number of individuals who persistently asked if they could give us a tour. They said they knew a quick entrance and an easy way to navigate throughout the Forbidden City. It's completely doable to join the queue yourself and navigate your way throughout it to the end rather happily.
All in all it was a great experience and it is certainly a must see!"
This place is a must see--Beijing vacation is incomplete without going to The Palace Museum. It's highly recommend; also pls keep yourself hydrated while exploring it since it's a lot of walk under the sun. Cheers
"This must be the number 1 thing to see in Beijing. There are crowds everywhere but what else can you expect in China. The place, like everywhere else, is badly signposted, so you walk forever to buy a ticket only to find it's the wrong area and you need to go elsewhere. You get hassled by people offering to be your guide for ¥200.
There are also scammers, but I was warned about these in advance. In my first case a young man approached me and said that there were too many people at that time queueing to get in so I should wait til after 3pm. He then suggested we could go somewhere together for a drink. I declined and had no problem getting in. The second case was as I was leaving when two young girls approached me to tell me I was going the wrong way out and should go with them and why not go and have a drink with them. Again I declined. The idea is that you get taken to a designated place where you have something small to drink and get hit with a massive bill. I've heard it called the tea house scam. Be warned.
The palace itself is spectacular but is so large. There are numerous buildings with massive paved areas between them. By the time you get to the end where you see the throne and the emporor's garden, you have to turn around and walk all the way back again, but don't expect to leave the way you came in and don't be so optimistic as to expect exit signs.
Despite all the walking and frustrations it is still a must do when in Beijing."
"Ok, this place is just essential - if you're in Beijing you have to do this. The queue for tickets can look daunting, you might have to wait 15 - 20 mins. There will be lots of people wanting to take you on a private tour - they'll charge 200 Yuan and offer to get you a ticket quicker. I'm glad I didn't. It was awesome just cruising through it at my own pace, going off to some of the side buildings (where all the people mysteriously just disappear - they all seem to concentrate down the centre).

The scope of this place is stunning. The ticket costs 60 Yuan, which is bugger-all in most currencies, and for that you step back hundreds of years in time to a lifestyle beyond our imagination. Woah!"
"You cannot visit Beijing and not visit the Forbidden City given its place in China's history but the crowds are pretty horrendous and the queues off putting. It took about 30-40 minutes to get through the security check before you even got to the main gate (I.e the main entrance where Chairman Mao's portrait hangs). You certainly need an audio or real life guide to benefit fully from the experience. To be honest it is courtyard after courtyard and the buildings all look the same .... I prefer other sights in a Beijing really .... It has also recently been made ""one way"" so you are not allowed to back track and revisit once you have passed a certain point (I.e. Where the shops are). On exiting the Forbidden City, do visit Coal Hill to get a bird's eye view of the whole complex."
Truly a magnificent place to visit. We spent only two hours after our business trip to visit the forbidden city including the palace gardens and it is quite impressive. Tickets can be bought at the entrance gate for 60 RMB. Audio guides (40 RMB) are available in all languages and are quite informative.
"I revisited the Palace Museum in May 2014 after probably more than 20 years of absence. Although there were many tourists, it actually didn't take long to buy the tickets. Once inside, the palace compound was so huge, we enjoyed a relatively quiet tour by avoiding the central line of palaces. There are many wonderful side shows on the two wings, such as the ancient pottery collection, a special show of ancient paintings and calligraphy, and a collection of antiques and curiosities, all were from the Qing royal collections. Two hours passed very quickly. One can easily spent a whole day or at least half day there. We were lucky to visit on a nice day, so the yellow glassy roof and the red wall of the palaces were really beautiful under the blue sky with patches of white cloud. The Palace Museum has a very informative website where you can take a virtual tour http://www.dpm.org.cn/shtml/2/@/8797.html#165 You can check it out before or after your visit."
"Been reading a lot about China and its history, and the Forbidden City is a priceless testimony how rich Chinese culture really is, it's history and tradition. This is a huge place, part of Chinese Ming and Qing dynasties. It is something worth to see in Beijing."
We used a guide. Might be difficult without one as little signage in English (that I noticed anyway). Interesting to see the scale and the architecture.
It's an exciting out of this world experience when you visit the Forbidden City of Beijing. It's huge a complex and full of History of China.
"It was a crazy time because it was in the middle of a holiday where the Chinese people celebrate the death of their relatives, so lots of people. Security was very tight but the line moved well. The palace itself is huge. Got the walking tour but found that many times what the tour was saying in my ear wasn't where I was. So, just walked. Very impressed and so happy when we finally found the end! The garden before the end is just beautiful!"
"For your best experience, hire one of the English-speaking tour guides. It was an amazing experience!"
"Dynastic grandeur at its best! Grand and Impressive are words I would use to describe this palace. The forbidden city is a priceless testimony to Chinese civilization during the Ming and Qing dynasties. Located smack bang in the middle of the city of Beijing, it is not hard to miss. It was the former home and pleasure dome to 24 emperors for almost 500 years. It is huge, so be prepared for lots of walking and crowds everywhere. We visited the forbidden city in May 2014 with a private tour guide. I loved it, and if I'm ever lucky enough to visit Beijing again I would definitely visit this site again."
"The Forbidden City is the historical & geographical centre of Beijing, so you simply cannot contemplate missing it if you ever visit Beijing - it's a must see attraction. But it's huge at 72ha, 980 buildings and over 8,800 rooms (not the fabled 9999). Once you walk through the Meridian Gate, the size of it alone will blow you away.
So where to start ? You could hire a guide, but I suggest you get a reputable one from a tour company or through your hotel, rather than choose one of the dozens that will mob you as you approach the ticket office. Or, you could follow the crowd, which usually means walking in a hot & pushy procession (if you visit in summer) along the centre line of the city. This will take you through the Meridian and Supreme Harmony gates, then on to the Halls of Supreme Harmony, Central Harmony & Preserving Harmony. You'll be amazed and see some very interesting history like the three imperial thrones. Following the centreline will also eventually lead you to the Palace of Heavenly Purity which was the residence of the Ming emperors but the audience hall of the Qing emperors, you'll stand in crowds waiting your turn to peer through glass and what you see will impress you. But you will miss many of the real treasures of the palace museum.
There is another route and its great on a really hot and crowded day.......
As you come through the Meridian gate take a sharp left and walk about 250m to the western side of the city, climb the ramp in front of the first building and follow the west-side of the city northward. (You'll be walking alone and in the shade for most of the journey). Soon you will encounter a series of exhibit rooms that hold; musical instruments, sculptures, ceramics, scientific instruments, enamelware, religious iconography and ancient artefacts from some private collections. These exhibit rooms are large, uncrowded and heavily air-conditioned. The age and condition of some of these treasures is astounding. You will arrive at the southern boundary of the inner court in great shape and probably ahead of the throng who milled along the centreline of the city.
Now start heading in toward the centreline. Take a quick look at the Hall of Mental Cultivation. Initially a minor area of the inner court, it became the residence of the Qing emperors and the area from which the empresses dowager, including Cixi, made decisions of State in the names of her son and nephew from ""behind the yellow screen"". Three emperors died in this hall.
Explore the inner court, this is where most of the really interesting buildings and of course the beautiful imperial gardens are located. There is nothing stopping you doubling back along the Halls of Harmony, of striking inward from the western side earlier but don't miss those exhibit rooms.
The Place Museum is at the north end of Tian an men square. Take the subway to Tian an men east or west. Take a cab, or walk if you are staying somewhere central like Wangfujing."
"Some people say that it's an overrated place but it is not true. Forbiden City makes an impression so it's worth to take a camera with you. If you are visiting in summer then make sure to take comfortable shoes and a hat with you. It's a popular place so remember that there will be lots of people. Besides that like I said in the beginning, Forbidden City is beautiful, it represents typical China architecture. If you are in Beijing then you have to come there."
"It's a challenge on TA to work out where to review the Forbidden City but this seems to be it!

It's unbelievably large, hot and busy - but well worth it in my opinion.

We had a guide which does make the difference to appreciate what all the buildings were for and the history of the place and why it's been built in the way it has.

Considering its age it's in very good condition and feels like it has been well looked after.

Allow 2 or 3 hours to explore it all and even longer if you are into Chinese history or architecture."
"Much of the buildings are closed off, with a few that you can peer into. It is grand, but found that after seeing the first few temples, it was all the same. We did not do this, but would recommend hiring a guide and negotiating the price before entering the palace."
"We visited the forbidden city at June 13th.
We arrived the area, thinking we will go ourselves but as we came closer to the forbidden city we regret that we didn't take a guide as being in Tienanmen square without one made us feel luck of info about the place...
Anyway, when we got close to the gate, few local guides offer their services. We chose a guide named Jason. Well, to make long story short I can tell you that we took him also the week after to the great wall. It was a great success. He turned to be a smart and full of knowledge guide with great English and also gave us the space when we needed it.
I definitely recommend to take his services!!

His email is Jasonguide@gmail.com

Hope you will find him great as we did."
"The Forbidden City is an important attraction in Beijing, but once the intitial ""wow"" moment when I saw the sheer size of the place was over, I felt a little disappointed by it all. The history and buildings can't fail to impress, but the site could be much better, especially the old living quarters which have no lighting and are hidden behind dirty glass windows. I recommend you go if you have a few days in BJ, but don't linger too much or you will end up spending most of the day here."
"If you're ever in Beijing (or even near Beijing) this incredibly historical piece of land is an absolute must-see. The palace complex is so intriguing and getting to see where China's past emperors lived is just mind-blowing. They even have replicas of the last emperor and two of his concubines up in one of the balcony's to make it interesting. Definitely walk through the gardens, they're beautiful and look into the windows of the rooms to catch a glimpse of the emperors bedroom and throne room. If you're white and blonde like me you will probably be asked to have a picture taken with by some of the native chinese there, that was pretty fun haha. But all in all this is definitely an experience you will never forget."
"Went here during the afternoon on a Tuesday and it was very busy as others have said, though if you step away from the masses and don't walk along with the crowd it's a lot easier to appreciate the views and take some better photos without people getting in the way. If you move off the main pathway through the forbidden city and go to some of the outer buildings it is much quieter.

I didn't see a lot of food/drink available so good idea to take your own. Also bring LOTS of water and be prepared for a lot of walking. There are a huge number of tourist shops inside for souvenirs.

If you come from the TIananmen Square end of the Forbidden City, when you exit, it's a good idea to cross the road and go to Jingshan Park. If it's a clear day there are amazing views of the Forbidden City from the park and it really gives you an appreciation of how huge it is.

Make sure you allow plenty of time for your visit. I'd say 3-4hrs minimum but you could easily spend a whole day, there is a huge amount to see. I used the audio guide which was really good and informative.

Definitely don't leave Beijing without visiting here!"
"I guess this is another one of the 'sights' that has to be seen in Beijing but not particualry awe inspiring or even interesting, apart from perhaps all the little inner quadrangles where the emperors harem used to live! Most of the real 'history & artifacts' seem to have either been obliterated or taken elsewhere? Taiwan perhaps?"
"You don't need to have a tour guide for this one, I bought an automatic guide that works like a GPS - it tells you the info once you get there. Lots of walking involved, so be ready. The architecture is amazing. I enjoyed it."
"- no visit to Beijing is complete without the Palace Museum (aka Forbidden City)
- highly recommend getting a guide as there's so much to learn & hear about the history of this place (plus, the guide gets your tickets through a dedicated queue, which saves tons of time!)
- great architecture, interesting stories & history, the size is awe-inspiring
- start at the Tienanmen Square and walk in
- wear comfortable shoes and be prepared to walk, walk & walk
- take some food & drink along (not much inside)"
"I highly recommend to take your time (wander around) and potentially spend half a day starting at the south entrance (near Tiananmen square) and exist through the north one, finishing the day in Jingshan park. It can be hot in summer so carry sufficient water."
"It's huge, take a bottle of water, and a hat if possible. Since the floor is covered with a kind of light gray stone your eyes might hurt because of the reflected sun light. Although is one of the most visited places on earth sometimes you can get lost, since in a lot of chinese attractions they don't put signs in all the intersections. There will be maps inside, but all in chinese.
Also everything is restored with new materials."
"Upon entering the Forbidden City, you must take-in how large everything is - as if it was built for giants. Just to walk through the first courtyard, you must cover so much ground, it's hard to imagine how many guards it took to cover the area."
"I could not believe the scale, the architecture and the sheer size of this magnificent palace. This is perhaps the jewel in the historical crown of Beijing. Don't miss it, spend a day & you won't regret it."
"My husband and I visited the Palace Museum on our first trip to Beijing in mid May. We were also travelling with our 18 month old at the time. To be honest, the Palace Museum was not initlaly part of our itinerary but it was a very rainy day and so we decided to visit the museum to stay indoors. It was definitely an interesting and eye opening experience with exhibits on pictures, paintings and artefacts from the previous dynasties. There were also more modern day artefacts featuring Chairman Mao and other prominent revolutionaries."
"The Palace Museum/Forbidden City is at the heart of China's capital city--there is no way you can visit Beijing or China as a whole and say that you've really seen the place until you've visited this definitive landmark that spans nearly all of the Ming and Qing dynasties. As always, if you are taken thru this site by a local, you are in excellent hands, for they can share with you the history and relevance of various objects and sections of the palace--expect to be impressed, for the average urban citizen knows their culture and history so much better than the people of any other country I've met so far. Absolutely eye-catching colours and architectural details. My personal favorite was the gardens and smaller buildings within the gardens. Food is available for purchase, but only at the snack level. Bring a big bottle of water and hand fan when it's hot; wear good walking shoes; definitely don't forget your camera! (ps--BTW, contrary to popular rumor, the Starbucks in the Forbidden City is no longer there.)"
"My daughter and I enjoyed spending much of the morning here yesterday and did so without a guide. Located just off the subway (very clean and easy to navigate + costs only 2 yuan for any start/finish trip in the city) across a very wide street from Tiannanmen Square, the Palace Museum (Forbidden City) is a must-see attraction. This was our first real sightseeing stop in Beijing, so it took a few minutes to get our bearings. For others who also need a little coaching, there is an underground walkway to cross the street from subway area to the Palace Museum (Forbidden City). The entrance to the Palace Museum (Forbidden City) is a very large picture of Mao that you can see from both sides of the street - so if you can get here, you're in the right place. Once you pass screening, you'll walk through a very large courtyard or two, then have an opportunity to buy tickets on your left (60 Yuan) and a self-guided audio tour (40 Yuan - purchased at separate location just before entering the ticket taker area).

Buy the audio tour device if you aren't planning on hiring a guide or coming with a group. The device has embedded location detection that allows it to know and provide information about where you within the compound. The place is massive, so I'd recommend sticking to a plan of taking your time moving down the center sections first (you'll be going south to north progressing through the city), then exploring in a more accelerated manner the West and East regions. The West region is nice in that you get a glimpse of gardens + some of the less ceremonial areas where emperors lived. The East side is nice too (also less ceremonial areas where emperors resided at times), but if you're in a hurry I'd go with the West side first when exploring the compound.

One final word of caution - if you're planning to go back to your starting point, know that you cannot simply backtrack and exit near the entrance - we tried this and were told the place we had to exit was on the east side of compound - this is not intuitive and we spent close to 30-min trying to find our way out, so be sure and ask (several people) the route you need to take to get out and to Tiannanmen Square region.

I would highly recommend the Palace Museum (Forbidden City) and can easily understand why it is on everyone's must-see list when visiting Beijing."
"Very crowded, mostly with Chinese tourists--which was a surprise. Warning it closes at four so leave enough time. Audio guide was worth it."
"The Imperial Palace is the main sight in Beijing and rightly so. The only problem is that thousands of Chinese tourist know this as well and their numbers might make the visit a bit tedious.

No worries though, here are my tips:

-Get off the main axis as soon as possible. Check out the gardens and museums to the right and left of it, it's far more peaceful and most of them are very interesting (like the museum of pottery for example).

-It closes around five or so. Around 4.30, speakers start saying the Palace Museum will close in half an hour and you should start heading to an exit. Since Chinese people tend to be polite and obedient, that is what most of them will do. You WON'T! That's the trick. You will hang around aimlessly, like a dumb white guy who doesn't know the way out, and will stay as much out of shouting range of the guards as possible. You'll have the entire Palace to yourself and about a 100 other smart guys by 5 PM. Seriously, it's a massive difference!

Thank me later! ;)"
"Better known as the Forbidden City. Extraordinary by any standards, with endless rooms & enormous courtyards.
History buffs will be enchanted. There are countless rooms & huge courtyards. It is also pretty crowded & very hot in Summer. Perhaps I'm not the only philistine who doesn't appreciate it fully. After a time there is a sameness & the heat begins to have an effect. After Great wall the day before, it all seemed a bit dull & dusty.
However, even if you feel the same way, who will visit Beijing & not go to the Forbidden City?
Note for entry. Go through the ""Gate of heavenly peace"" (With huge picture of Mao) but don't go through the centre, which is to climb the gate itself."
It was very impressive. The architecture and intricate designs of the buildings were beautiful. Experiencing the magnificence of past dynasties of emperors was an awesome experience.
"In the heart of Beijing and easily accessible by using the subway. Subway is safe, fast, and the ticket machines have a button that will give instructions in english, inexpensive but crowded at some times.
The Forbidden City is enormous with lots of walking. Shows the history and the artifacts of the dynasties. Architecture and paintings on ceilings let you imagine life centuries ago. Very sad that without temperature control, some of the items seem to be deteriorating..cannot help wondering if they may eventually be lost forever.
Sunny and in mid 90's but water and food available. Crowds were light in the morning. Bathrooms clearly marked, but as with all of China,carry your own toilet paper."
"As part of our China Spree tour we visited the Forbidden City or Imperial Palace, as it is known by the local Chinese. I highly recommend a visit with a tour guide because this city is massive with 9,999 rooms on 150 acres. Once inside each courtyard within a courtyard has its own reason for existence. Plus you will appreciate the historical significance of the palace as each successive emperors occupied the palace. For instance you learn there are no trees or landscaping because the emperors knew no enemy with a weapon could hide from view in an open area. The richness of the historical past, interwoven with the feng shui master plan layout, plus how life must have been like during the centuries within the wall for men and women was worth our visit.

Be aware you must be in good walking condition due to the uneven surfaces, multiple stairs, and vastness of the palace buildings. Plus the visit requires stamina weaving in and out of massive crowds. Also note there are limited bathroom facilities within the palace grounds."
"Definitely a place that has to be seen. Space, architecture, history - all work for it and this attraction cannot be missed when visiting Beijing. However....
The entire experience is spoiled by the crowds visiting the place - even for Beijing standards the number of visitors caused queues to see every single interesting part of the Forbidden City.
Consider visiting on a weekday, and in less popular hours (just after opening, or shortly before closing)"
A beautiful place rich in history. Be sure to rent an audio guide for the trip and avoid the place on weekends and on hot days.
This is a huge place to visit with a lot to cover. We had a guided tour which is truly the only way you should visit this museum. The guides give you the stories behind the walls that surround you. The culture you feel when being here is amazing and just looking at the ground you are walking on in inspiring.
"The Forbidden city is amazing and definately worth going through. It was crowded and very, very hot. We used the audio, which didn't work that great, but still enough to get some information."
"This place was so crowded that we were basically swept along with the crowd. There are no holds barred. If you aren't willing to shove your way to the front, you will not see a thing. It is an interesting place and we learned a lot about the history."
"It's one of THE PALACEs to visit before you die. The place is huge. You could spend a quick 2 hour or up to 6 hours scrolling around this beautiful palace. The audio guide was helpful. It had a location sensor and audio will play once you arrive at points of interests. On the device, you can also see what are the remaining points of interests to visit. In the summer, bring a hat because you will be outdoor a lot. The food and restaurant in the museum was only so-so. I saw many other Chinese tourists bringing their own food, which may not be a bad idea. If enter from south entrance, don't forget go across the street from north exit to visit JingShan Park. Or if enter from north entrance, visit JingShan Park before the museum. Climb up the hill to get a panoramic view of the Forbidden City!"
"If you love history - it is a must place for you to visit. I love Chinese arts, calligraphy and paintings. One of the most impressive items that I saw was the special GUQIN - China's most ancient musical instrument. Wish I could have have a chance to play it."
"Another bucket list item, the Forbidden City is a location you would regret missing. The massive complex, if not for the crowds, really emphasizes the might and loneliness one could feel as the Emperor (and yes, it'll make you want to watch The Last Emperor). You will spend HOURS here- bring plenty of water and snacks! And patience- the tour groups will fight you for a view into the historical buildings and rooms. Don't bother with the audio guide! It basically reads you the same information on the info plaques and will not repeat itself; it works on GPS and will stop if you move out of the receiver's range."
"You cant access any rooms - just view through the windows. We were rushing through the place due to crowds and very bad air pollution. Be ready to be brutally pushed by other tourists, mainly locals. If you want to see anything be prepared to push through yurself"
"You will want to see ""The Last Emperor"" again! Go early as it can get quite crowded. Read before you go or get a seasoned guide because there is so much cool stuff to see."
"Two precautions to start - the Forbidden City is huge and it takes about 3 hours to walk from one end to the other allowing time to stop at the mot prominent sites on the way. Also, there is not a lot of shade so if you go in late spring or summer wear sunscreen, and a hat and bring a sun umbrella. You need a guide to appreciate the significance and/or function of the numerous bridges, pagodas, building and statues."
"It is huge, it is important, it will teach you about Chinese history and culture. Yes, it is crowded and not overwhelmingly beautiful. But it is in good shape, and different from anything outside China. Get a guide for a personal tour -- that way you will understand what you are seeing and why and how the place functioned when it was an imperial palace and not a tourist attraction. It was meant to be intimidating and to make a statement about the power of the rulers over the people -- and it does!"
This is a check it off the list type of visit. Hire a guide for the best experience. The place is huge and hard to immagine the operating of it. the guide helps to understand the intricacies of the place and why there are so many sections. Go early to beat the crowds.
"After seeing beautiful temples and palaces in Japan, China and Cambodia, this was uninspiring. It is big, and crowded, and mainly treeless. (The garden at the end it nice, but generally barren.) Most buildings look alike. Was it forbidden because they were embarrassed by it? If you want to be impressed, go by the Lama Temple."
"The Forbidden City is the largest and most complete group of ancient buildings in China. It was the home of two dynasties of Emperors and was their seat of government. The area is large with sprawling grounds containing ancient pavilions and squares. It is only open for 8 hours a day and attracts thousands of visitors - many large tour parties led by guides bellowing through microphones.in the spring and summer it is also very hot and exposed.

A guide is not necessary but the right one can be helpful to explain the history as you go. Everybody enters the South Door and the ticket cost is reasonable. We deliberately walked up the east side. That is where the shade is. The vast majority of visitors and all the tour groups seem to plough straight up the centre. We only merge into the centre to view the ceremonial halls such as Taihedian - the Hall of Supreme Heaven; Zhonghedian - the Hall of Middle Harmony; Baohedian - the Hall of Preserving Harmony. This is very worthwhile but it is a scrum of bodies around the few limited viewpoints that enable you to gaze into the interiors. Its not for the shy and polite. Its head down and charge.

The Forbidden City does provoke a sense of awe and is so very much the central attraction of Beijing."
Iconic place and a must see. The 999 rooms get a bit samey but you don't have to walk through them all but make sure you allow plenty of time.
"First thing first.. don't hire a guide.. just do some web surfing before the visit to understand what is what otherwise you will be lost and won't understand what you have visited. This is part of the greater Forbidden City and nothing new, its just a Palace. Take some pictures and move on.. You can't avoid it while you are in Beijing."
"This is a must see, even if you have to fight the crowds, walk forever to catch a cab, and sustain the excessive amount of attention that will be lavished upon you, by the Chinese people. Seriously, you're going to feel like a movie star once you leave the compound, especially if you bring children. Actually, this will happen at almost any tourist attraction in Beijing, including the Great Wall at Mutianyu. The Chinese just love to get their pictures taken with ""Americans"" (and when I say ""Americans"", I mean any nationality that is not Chinese... if you are Finnish/German/Italian/Whatever, you're ""American"" to them)
Within the walls of the Forbidden City, you can't help but to feel a sense of awe as you move through the courtyards, and push your way up to the entrances, and windows of the Thrown Rooms. At some point you will find yourself in the Imperial Garden, with petrified cypress trees (?) or something that looks ancient and amazing!
We foolishly went to the Forbidden City before Tiananmen Square, which is right across from the South entrance of the City. However, out the back exit of the City is Jingshan Park, which is pretty cool. But, it's not easy getting a cab back to the South entrance, so think it through... I would to Tianamen Square first (kind of boring, but huge history significance), then walk through the Forbidden City, and if you have anything left in your legs, take a stroll through Jingshan Park. Then, if you're some kind of endurance freak, take a left out of the park, down Zhishanmen Street, and across Doushan Bridge to Beihai park... it's a really cool island in the middle of the ""Northern Sea"" (aka Beihai)."
"This is definitely something you have to visit while in Beijing. I recommend getting an audio guide or hire a guide so that you can actually appreciate the Forbidden City, otherwise it's just a bunch of temples with some significance. The city is huge, we stayed for 2 hours and didn't see anything. For some reason they kicked everyone out at 2 p.m. and wouldn't let us back in. Still not sure what that was about."
"The Palace Museum is the real name for the Forbidden City. Most tours whisk you through in two hours, but you could easily spend much more time and see more."
"That being said, it is not the most impressive palace I have seen. The place has history. If you have a tour guide, it is good to hear about the function of each pagoda and square and bridge you see, and the details are very interesting, but the visual experience is not overwhelming. Probably the audio guide can be helpful too, I have not tried it as I had a real guide. But without either of those two, just walking around in there would not be the best memory of your life.

I learnt little about Chinese history so all the information the guide told us during the tour was kind of new and interesting to me which added to the experience a lot.

I found that the Yu Yuan Garden in Shanghai and the Presidential Palace in Nanjing were more interesting, but still, if you go to Beijing and not go to the Palace, well, that would be a sin. :)"
"The space is huge with many buildings. It is beautifully restored. The area was the home of the emperor, his family and staff. We went with a guide which was very helpful in understanding the buildings, features and history. For example the center bridges and entries could only be used by the emperor except after a certain ceremony."
"I think you have to go here if you are in Beijing, simply because of its history. However, if you are limited in time or have had plenty of other experiences with temples, culture, etc., I would plan a short amount of time and save more time for other places. It is absolutely huge and very crowed. I had already been in various cities and sites in China for about 2-3 weeks, so I am trying to review this from the perspective of someone that had not had these experiences."
It was a really incredible experience seeing all of the Forbidden City and took quite a lot of walking! The detailed artwork and architecture were great and hearing about it all along the tour was quite fascinating. The sculptures were great too.
"It was a pleasant trip and a place worth visiting. There is a lot of walking, and only in one direction (from south to north if I remember correctly), so it’s good to know before. We did not take a guide but bought an audio guide (40 yuan) which was not that enjoyable after all. I could not focus on the recording and was distracted by the crowds.

The thing that we liked the most was not really connected with this impressive place. For 30 yuan we dressed up in some colourful Chinese clothes and took photos of each other. A lot of Chinese people wanted a photo of us as well, so we ended up standing there and posing for about 20 minutes… Makes you feel like a celebrity…

On our way out, we decided to take a bus to Tiananmen Square, but we took a bus in the wrong direction and ended up being scammed by a dishonest rickshaw driver."
"There are places not worth to say much, the wonderful and so much known they are. So focus on practical tips.
I´m amazed that this not ranked among top 2 or 3 attractions.
Metro station right at the door of Tianamen Square.
You get into this huge place right at Chairman Mao´s paint, from Tianament Sqaure.
Don´t get impressed abou the many people, besides being in China, this is a must, so crowds and done deal.
Keep walking thru the first walls. When you passed the first gate, you´ll see ticket offices to your left. Easy to recognize by the quees. But move quite quick. Have cash, this is the way things works in China.
I was a first timer to China at that time, no one single word of Chinese, and there was no problems at all.
With tickets in hands, proceed to entrance, right on the same direction your heading to when came in.
at the left side, before giving tickets you have this listening tours, with a modern tech, even as everything in China lacks maintenance, is already in bad shape. But works well.
And here an importante chapter: a guide is not mandatory, you can easily find yourself inside. I didnpt get one, but could have considered. But if you decide not to have, buy this audio guides. They worth the price. There´s a map on it, and as soon as youwalk thru a place, it will recognize and start explaining. Very usefull.
The major thing that is was a very bad surprise for me is that you don´t get inside in almost any of the many buiildings, and waht you see from outside is nothing. Open spaces, here and there with a bed or a throne in a very dark environment.
So focus on the buildings architecture, that as I said, are amazing.
Be prepared with good walking shoes, and avoid rainy days. Is a wide and open space. Bring some water to drink, not manyoptions inside.
You can get out from the opposite side you camein, but don´t know is a good idea."
"It is great! It's a large open space with so many buildings from the old dynasty. I would recommend a tour guide, who can give you some idea. Bargain for their price. I would also completely avoid this place on weekends and especially Chinese holidays. Way too busy!"
"No question the palace is an incredible architecture, nothing to compare with, the giant size and the details. However the maintenance and the behaviour of many visitors leaved much to be desired, that's not how one should treat this historic monument! Unfortunately not all areas are opened to the public, still need a good whole day to visit if you want to take the history in. Definitely should go there early to avoid the long queue!"
"First time in Beijing and went straight to Forbidden City. Being obvious tourists we tried to blend in and look knowledgeable of surroundings. The huge lines at ticket office made us look completely desperate when a young guide approached us. Tip: look desperate, there are young guides all overall the place with very decent price and good English. They have access to fast lines and know a lot! The guy spent the whole day with us telling about everything. So don't buy expensieve hotel tours, just look desperate in Forbidden City!"
"The Forbidden City is astonishing. We walked from our hotel in Wangfujing to Tiananmen Square and entered by the Tiananmen Gate. After a short walk we arrived at the ticket office where there were long queues and many guides offering to get us in quicker. The guides offer limited time eg 2 hours but we were glad we waited (not too long) and went in independently. We wandered at our own speed and were able to spend longer at areas of interest and to skip others (with 9000 rooms choices have to be made). There were short signs everywhere with information in Chinese and English - enough to identify what was around. The clock museum (extra payment needed) had a water clock and, at the far end, a video of many of the display clocks actually working and demonstrating their moving parts (if you can get a seat, this is a great place to stop for a while in a cool place)."
"Once you get to the huge picture of Chairman Mao you then enter the Gates of the Forbidden City. We thought that once we were inside the gate that was it. But no, you enter several sets of gates before you actually get to the Imperial Palace. The Chinese believe that if you touch the sets of 9 golden nails on each gate, that it will bring you good luck because 9 is a powerful number and the Emperor was a powerful figure!

There are several courtyards as you walk through the gates and in front of the palace is an ornate bridge and moat. There are sculptures of a bronze crane and turtle. The Chinese believe that by touching the turtle or having your photo taken along side it, this will bring you longevity and well being. There are several sculptures of large lions and large incense burners. Also large pots that used to be filled with water in case of fires, because all of the buildings are made from wood. We noticed some ornate features on some of the ceilings. The City for its scale was impressive, as is the colour of the buildings.

We entered the Treasure House where there are several display cases containing jade artifacts and some huge jade carvings which were beautiful. There are also some royal crowns which are very intricate. It's a pity that they don't keep the glass clean!! There was nothing else to look at because some of the Emperor's belongings that still exist are housed in the Taiwan Museum. This was a great disappointment and we had also expected to be shown into some of the Emperor's living areas with some of his furniture and belongings). We recall seeing a display case that contained a silver ring that belonged to the Emperor, but it didn't look real as it was more of a modern design.

If you are intending to visit this place then you need to get yourself a guide that has an education in Chinese History, rather than just a guide that just walks you through pointing out basic facts. Perhaps if we had done so, our experience would have been a better one. It was worth the visit to experience the size of the Forbidden City and to be transported back in time, but we left feeling disappointed. There are restoration works going on and there is still heaps more to be done. This was evident when we entered the Treasure House as there are repairs that need attending to.
Several of the empty buildings along some of the courtyards are now being use to sell souvenirs. What a shame..................

Tip: Don't visit during a public holiday, the crowds are unbearable."
"You basically have to go to the Forbidden Palace if you find yourself in Beijing. I've never seen anything as impressive as this massive architectural complex, and I doubt I ever will. If you take a brisk walk from the entrance to the exit, you could be done in less than an hour - but where's the fun in that? Had I had the option, I would've liked to spend a good four or five hours here at minimum to absorb all that the complex had to offer.

It's helpful to have a guide along, so that you can get some idea of what you're looking at and why it's important."
"The Imperial Palace halls and gardens are truly a delight.
If you get a good guide with a good knowledge of the ancient Chinese history, you will almost feel like you're living the story within this Forbidden City.
But don't try to cram every nook and corner in one visit. You cannot do full justice to the Palace in one visit.
I was pressed for time so walked through from the South Gate to the North walking past the residential palace, empress hall and the gardens.
But I was satisfied with whatever I saw in the 2 hours I was there.
If I had more time, would have surely visited the museums and the other sights within the City."
"This place was so big that we would've been lost without a guide. Decide beforehand which areas you'd like to visit, as there isn't enough time in one day to see the entire Forbidden City. A guide will also help you understand what you're looking at, which is important here because there weren't many signs around. Try to avoid the crowds, especially on warm and humid days. And, be prepared to walk a lot! Bring your own toilet paper with you."
"We visited the palace on the weekend, as you can imagine it was busy and over-crowded. Despite having to fight the crowds we enjoyed just taking our time walking around. There is a lot to see but after a while everything starts to look the same.. I definitely recommend it to anyone visiting Beijing, the scale and detail of the palace is impressive and its an important part of history."
"Now, don't get me wrong. You still have to visit the Forbidden Palace to claim that you have went to Beijing. The architecture on offer there is amazing and the grounds, huge. The problem is, the crowds there are even larger. It is so jam packed with people shouting, spitting, pushing, and shoving that it really leaves a black mark on the whole tourist experience...

1). How do I get there?

Take the subway and get off at either Qianmen station, Tiananmen West or East station. I got off at Qianmen station and walked across Tiananmen Square towards the Forbidden Palace. I guess you kill two birds with one stone that way?

2). What is there to see there?

Quite a lot. Problem is, with the amount of people there, you won't be able to see much. Besides, the interior exhibits and displays are not lighted, meaning that you won't be able to see what is inside a certain building from afar. The huge volume of people there means that you just won't be able to squeeze up front to look at the exhibits, which is a real shame. The most that you will be able to see would be architecture and the greatest takeaway would be the sheer sense of scale and size which the palace offers in abundance.

3). How long should I spend there?

This is a tricky one. Do you really want to spend your time jostling to see the exhibits? If you do, that could take up to three hours or more. If you don't (like me), then an hour would do. Just take a stroll from the main gate to the end and appreciate.

4). Any other tips?

Don't buy the additional side tickets. It really isn't worth it. The good stuff is all in the National Palace Museum in Taiwan. Once you are out of the palace, please do yourself a favor (and give yourself a respite from the crowds) by visiting Jingshan Park and Beihai Park (they are connected and both are at the north of the palace). These two attractions are, in my opinion, really underrated. An additional plus for all you shutterbugs would be that you will be able to get a bird's eye view of the palace at Jingshan Park. The photo opportunity there is better as compared to that afforded in the palace itself. To get there, simply leave via the north of the palace (the main exit) and take the underpass to the other side of the street. You will find yourself at the entrance to Jingshan Park and you will need to pay a small fee for both parks. It is well worth your time and money though!

Well... That's it! A must visit and good luck with the crowds!"
"Forbidden City is probably one of the most challenging sites to visit (and enjoy at the same time): it is extremely overcrowded and terribly immense, so I d recommend to inform yourself as much as possible about it and come up with a rough ""visiting plan"".

We were motivated to see as much as possible (and we had a whole day for it), but in end, I d say we would have been happier and less exhausted if we had skipped some parts.

From the point of view of ""avoiding the crowds"", we did rather well (well, probably November being a low season helped): we rushed through the central axis to the garden as fast as possible to get ahead of the groups. Unfortunately, in the garden a group of Chinese tourists (they were probably the first group to enter at 8.30) surrounded us to take pictures (you d better say no in Forbidden city, because there are too many of them and you will never get away). The Garden itself is not very impressive (at least not in November). We then wanted to walk through the Palace of Peace and Longevity from north to south, but discovered that you could only cross it from south to north. We then visited the Clock Hall (not bad, but not really an experience of a life-time) and wandered a bit through the courtyards between the Clock Hall and the garden. This part was relatively empty and calm and we picnicked in one of the courtyards for lunch. After that, we visited the Western Palaces, which are particularly linked to the story of the last emperor and empress and are completely overcrowded for that reason. We escaped from there to the Nine Dragon Screen and went through the Palace of Peace and Longevity that turned out to be our favourite part of the Forbidden City. Afterwards, we came back to the southern part and saw the ceramics gallery (nice, but not really a ""must-see""). At this point, there were only 30 min left before closing time and we came back to the central axis to find it almost empty and bathed in a beautiful golden sunset light.

If I had an opportunity to visit the Forbidden city again with a friend who never been there, I would treat the whole visit as a relaxing walk through an old town rather than a sight-seeing marathon. Indeed, the Forbidden City is so huge, walking through it is like walking through a old town centre of some (rather big) town in Italy. Like with Florence or Venice, the beautiful part of the visit is not really to see 2 or 3 highly impressive buildings, but to admire the site as a whole and maybe spare some time to look at little pretty details like intricate door knobs or roof guardians. So I would come early in the morning, walk quickly through the central part, towards the Western Palaces (if my friend absolutely wanted to see them, otherwise I d skip that), cross through the garden and the courtyards (those behind the Clock Hall) to the entrance of the Palace of Peace and Longevity, visit it, explore the central part from north to south in the evening and leave by the East gate (the North is far away from the metro). And of course i would sit down every hour for 10-15 min, snack a little bit (bring some food with you!) and just watch the buildings instead of rushing past them."
"Maybe because we are taken for granted there. The place is huge but there is only little to see there. It is packed with tourists (mostly Chinese) and the exhibitions are few and badly maintained.
On your way out you will meet ugly China. Cab drivers who make their living out of robbing you, endless ques to public transportation.
Go but do not expect much."
Massive palace. You will need at least 3 hrs to finish whole palace but it takes only 1 hour from one end to other i.e. if you miss going in its sides. Audio guide (40 RMB) is really informative(GPS enable!) and do buy to understand the place. ..no need of personal guide. Ticketing counter that comes first is for Tianamen square and its just 15 RMB. Go ahead for The palace museum (forbidden city) which cost 60 RMB.
"It was too crowded to be as cool as I was hoping... The audio guide made the visit more meaningful, but I was more overwhelmed by the sheer amount of tourists than by the beauty of this place.

If you don't mind crowds, maybe you will find it more interesting than I did.

It's something to visit for sure, but I only had a short time in Beijing (only time to visit the Forbidden City). Everyone stopped frequently to take pictures (adding to congestion), and this blocked some of the sight-seeing opportunities. I wish I went somewhere else, but I don't really like crowds... if you don't mind them, this would likely be more fun for you (notably, if you're really into architecture, and have a bit of a background in Chinese history)."
The Forbidden City is really incredible but there were just too many people. Head for the sides where it is quieter and there are exhibits in some of the rooms where they lived. The gardens are interesting - there's so much to take in. Maybe it's better to go early before the crowds.....
"It's been about 5 years since my last visit. We went early thinking we could avoid the crowd but we were wrong. The amount of people kept increasing. Huge Chinese crowds and you don't get to see the halls or even take a picture of it! Constant shoving, squeezing and pushing by the locals here and there! You can't take a nice picture as it was too crowded. The palace is littered with rubbish, spits and children peeing everywhere. DO NOT visit anywhere during Chinese Holiday"
"Having been in Beijing over the holiday period, we were wondering if we would get to see the Forbidden City. Twice we turned back as the crowds were a solid block of people. We are so pleased we waited until today, when it felt like we had the place to ourselves. We queued at the ticket office from 8am, so were pretty much the first people in at 8.30 when in opened. The tour groups were massing in the courtyard but that was the only time we saw them for the first hour of our visit. We walked through the empty courtyards to the Treasure Gallery. It was well worth paying the extra 10 RMB to enter this section of the palace and we had it completely to ourselves. This is where the nine dragon screen and the wonderful opera building are located. After exiting the Treasure Gallery we looped back to see the rest of this vast site. This is where we encountered the crowds for the first time. A wonderful palace, but come early."
"We visit the place on 1 may when was very crowded. The ticket line was extremely long so we choose to hire a guide for the price of 400 rmb. The decision was great. The guide help us buy tickets without stay in line and provide many interesting informations during our visit there.

The palace is huge place so get ready to walk a lot. All squares are huge and similar with one each other. Therefore if you see one you can consider you see it all.

We finish the tour with a tea presentation in a tea house witch was very interesting."
"We went early (8:30 am) on a Wednesday morning to try to avoid the crowds. Wrong! It seems that early morning is when all the tour groups converge on the place. There were so many tour leaders with flags and blaring speakers that it was difficult to concentrate on what there is to see. I know that the crowds are part of the experience but this was ridiculous, especially since people tend to be very pushy around here. There are some quiet areas in the side galleries (e.g. the ceramics gallery and the clocks gallery) but the central areas can be insane. I read somewhere that the place is geared up to handle up to 80,000 tourist a day but that number is routinely exceeded with holiday numbers sometimes hitting 200,000 a day. The place is big but it seems pretty small when that many people all want to see the same temple at the same time. Be prepared to feel like a sardine occasionally if you go."
"I was expecting something amazing, but I can't say it met that expectation. It's cool, the overall size is pretty impressive, but it's not quite as ornate as I was expecting. It's kind of just a series of large open areas amongst less than ornate buildings. I thought the Grand Palace in Bangkok was much more exciting. Lastly, the crowds were intense when I was there, avoid weekends."
"We visited on a week day (which is wise to avoid the worst crowds). Enter after visiting Tian'anmen Square to the south.

It is very interesting, and the name 'Forbidden City' isn't a joke, you need about 3 or more hours to explore here as it's huge). The main areas in the centre were so crowded we couldn't see much (and all the rooms/halls are cordoned off so you can only peek in anyway). It was much more enjoyable to escape the crowds into the east and west wings where there are numerous courtyards with pretty trees and you can just about imagine what it might have been like in the past. A highlight for me was the opera house in the north/west section and the living quarters of the concubines in the west section (the latter was very popular with crowds, so head there first if you get in early?).

I wouldn't bother getting the expensive audio guide, it wasn't worth it because you get one ear piece so it's very hard to concentrate on what is being said with people around you, and the info wasn't that amazing (with the exception of the story about concubine Zhen who was drowned in the well - google it instead!). There is a severe lack of information in the palace in English, so I recommend reading up before you go or perhaps get a good guide (in retrospect I wish I had arranged this)."
"Great Place to see...but sadly one might find it very difficult to get a taxi from the Exit (North Gate) as Taxis Dont Stop....it Might be a hell of a problem if you looking for a Taxi to go to your next destination unless you want to travel by Bus(which are frequent).
It is recommeded that one Books a Car to travel to this place...Esp if you travelling as a family(with small Kids)"
"I can't tell u more abt forbidden city. Its a palace that s built during ming and qing dynasty.I'm not into palace and kind of annoyed by too many crowds visitting the place yesterday.but the feeling was changed just when I stepped onto the supreme hall and heard the story about emperor pu yi from my guide. The last emperor movie had been considered to be the most boring movie I ever seen,yet I was too small to understand when I watched it that time. Seeing the palace where he was decrowned and being kept there until the age of 24 and then forced to move out from it, it was just sadly amazing. I even walked thru the path where he was guarded to walk out from it. This place reminds me the old memory abt the movie again and now I plan to watch it again to understand it better.the one and only movie that ever was filmed in the forbidden city itself"
"Forbidden city, known officially as the Palace Museum, makes great impression. Historic walls, gardens and impressive buildings allow you to imagine how the life looked centuries ago. The only problem is the omnipresent crowd…"
The name was confusing initially but once we got over that it was great visit. The main palaces attract the biggest crowds but the living quarters behind are the real attraction - don't miss .
"Put on your walking shoes.....Yellow roofs, white terraces and hordes of tourists, mainly Chinese in March. Disappointing that you can't go inside any building, apparently there was too much touching and graffiti. We entered the S gate (emperor only) left by the N (concubines). Opportunities for dressing up, or taking pics of others dressing up."
"Prior to visiting I had been enamored with the movie The Last Emperor and all the pomp and circumstance.
Once arriving it was just buildings and architecture, and even though I had read various things about the F.C. here and there, I truly wish I had gotten a guide for the day to give us a more in depth description of what each building was and it's place in history.
You are only able to look inside some Halls behind a velvet rope, and good luck getting close enough to take a good photo because that one open door does get crowded. But as mentioned many doors are closed and there are many many buildings to see and walk around.
The audio guides you rent are helpful but they do not hold a candle to any European Rick Steves audio guide, lol.
Overall, we were very exhausted from walking around haplessly sometimes, but we don't regret it.
It is unlike anything we have seen or will see in the near future.
So with all this "" Positivity "" in mind, do take a chance to go if you have time, it is most certainly worth the RMB, I do recommend a good guide book or guide and pack a lunch as you'll want to stop and take a breather here and there."
"Everyone must go through long queue for bag x-ray, but they really don't seem to be giving more than a cursory look - seems more for show. The first entrance you find a ticket office with a price of 15 RMB, this is only for viewing the Tiemanmen gate, NOT for the rest of the Palace. Avoid this as you also have to check your bags and its overpriced. Instead just proceed into the next area for the Palace Complex - which is 60 RMB (about $10). Another queue for bag x-ray to get into this section as well. I went about 11am, and there were so many throngs of people that you could barely look into some of the major buildings. Going through most of it took about 3 hours. Unofficial 'guides' will ask you to be their guide at the Palace Complex ticket office - just ignore them. You are supposed to use the official guides you can get when you pass through security and bag x-ray for the Palace complex. You exit at the north entrance and it takes abut 25 minute walk back to the south entrance and Tiemamen Square."
"We spend a lot of time here. Be ready to walk for long distance and makes you are wearing appropriate shoes. The place is just awesome, the architecture is magnificent. I thought it helped that we have our personal guide explaining to us the historical significance of each building and how in ancient China the buildings were used by the emperor and his wives, concubines, and people in power with him."
"The fabulous Forbidden City palace complex in Beijing, once off limits to all but China's nobilty, is now crowded with tourists like you and I. Best time to visit is weekdays before noon. Entrance is on the north side of Tiananmen Square.
After going through security and past the ticket taker, there is an audio guide rental which was available (according to the sign) in 40 languages. Inside signs are in Mandarin and English. Public toilets were located throughout the complex. There were several small places to buy food, snacks and drinks.
My favorite part was the surprisingly charming Imperial Garden that you will pass through just before you exit."
"I was on a business trip with a day to spare in Beijing, so I took the opportunity to be a tourist. I enjoyed the museum and all of tour
Once in a lifetime opportunity."
"This place was an experience in its own. The palaces and the entire city was amazing. Need an entire day to cover the whole area, but its worth it!"
"There have only been 3 cultural attractions in Asia that I did not find as interesting as I had hoped: Candi Prambanan in Yogyakarta, Pura Besakih in Bali, and the Forbidden City in Beijing. I just didn’t find the Forbidden City in Beijing particularly interesting at all, especially when considering the other amazing places I have been fortunate enough to visit previously. Or maybe it was just the ice cold weather in Beijing at the time of my stay which affected my morale? Don’t get me wrong, the place is still mightily impressive (it’s hard not to be impressed with the historic culture and architecture on display throughout Beijing), it’s just that for something considered to be one the ultimate tourist destinations in all of China, my experience there was not up the level I had hoped for having read the guidebooks. The Temple of Heaven is without question in my mind superior to the Forbidden City in every way for a tourist.

The Beijing Forbidden City was built between 1406-1420 and was the site of the Imperial Palace for the Ming Dynasty and right up until the end of the Qing Dynasty. It is situated at the heart of Beijing, and most of Beijing’s outer ring roads are encircling the Forbidden City at regular intervals. That’s how the roads of Beijing are designed and operated even to this day. The Forbidden City was listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1987 and is also known as the largest collection of preserved wooden structures in the world. Within its 720,000 square meters, the Forbidden City is the site of nearly one thousand buildings of various sizes. Nowadays, of course, it has been renamed to The Palace Museum.

One thing I will say about the Forbidden City is that it is steeped in history. It is almost overwhelming to have a complex so large to explore, yet it remains one of the main tourist draws to Beijing – along with the Great Wall of China, of course – and as such it can get very busy. I have seen signs in the grounds of the Forbidden City which remind visitors to not climb on the walls and not to touch the artefacts. It seems the Chinese are very keen to preserve these artefacts even during the increasing numbers of tourists flocking to the site each year. In fact, nowadays, the Forbidden City is controlled by the Palace Museum, who help in the upkeep of all the ancient artefacts. You can access the area by taking the Beijing Subway Line 1 to either Tiananmen East or Tiananmen West stations and then walking along the road to the impressive entrance to the Palace Museum.

I guess my experience at the Forbidden City could have been a case of not researching the attraction before my visit. When visiting the likes of Borobudur in Indonesia or Bagan in Myanmar you should have a good background of the temple sites and the history associated with them, otherwise it is unlikely you will get the full immersive experience. I didn’t read up much on the Forbidden City before visiting, so maybe I was the architect of my own downfall in that regard. I paid 40CNY for admission, and there were options to buy additional tickets for another 10CNY each which would have given me admission to the Treasure Gallery and the Clock & Watch Gallery. Neither really interested me too much, so I just bought the standard admission ticket. The ticketing counters here at the Forbidden City are very decrepit and cramped, and the queues – while not particularly long, nor slow-moving – were just dull and uninspired, as were penned in like cattle in perpendicular lines. There were many tours (official or not?) also running these lines trying to sell themselves as guides, and you would be advised to do what I did, and just basically refuse to look them in the eyes as they walk past. That way, they may leave you alone. They are not aggressive; merely loud and annoying, and it’s not a great way to start the tour of supposedly one of Beijing’s main attractions.

Some people recommend a visiting time of around 4 hours at the Forbidden City. I would say that that is the least amount of time you need to really give the place a good going over. There are is simply too much to look at, and in my opinion, a lot of it looks the same, despite the history of the each building/artefact. It’s like an open-air museum in Luxor or something (but without the desert sunshine) only here on display it’s precious Chinese cultural gems rather than ancient Egyptian antiquities. I spent around 3 hours or so here, and all I seemed to do was walk through endless gate after gate. I am aware of the inner and outer courtyard structure of the city, but I became disoriented very quickly, and it was simply too cold to go on any further: my feet were freezing! I had a good experience up to a point, although it was not as impressive an experience as I had hoped for. I am sure hundreds of thousands of visitors each year love the place, although I am always interested to hear travellers’ tales and comparisons of Beijing’s tourist sites, such as The Temple of the Heaven, and the Summer Palace. Surely they are equally as impressive as the Forbidden City? Yet they do not get the same level of promotion by the tour guides, which is a great shame."
"The Palace Museum or as most people know it as the ""Forbidden City"" is one of the most daunting and breathtaking places in the world. As you walk through this amazing outdoor venue, your breath will be taken away with the immensity of the area and the detail in every structure that you come in contact with. You will need a couple of hours to walk from one end to the other if you are in good physical form, otherwise plan on half the day. There are plenty of marquees to read, a few rooms of artifacts with stories behind them and rooms upon rooms to visit with amazing detail. I would recommend a guide to give the history more detail and meaning. It is my second visit and I am still stunned with amazement. It is right next to Tianamen Square so I would stroll through the Palace Museum, have lunch and proceed with Tianamen Square."
"This amazing Forbidden City is massive, and if you really want to understand every corner of each Dynasty, then be willing to spend a half a day or a whole day as you need to walk and walk and walk until you reached the inner part of the Forbidden City. We were very lucky, we started early with our guide and managed to get in without having to fight your way among the Chinese tourists !
Just beyond my imagination how the Emperors, lived such a life! Interesting probably during those days, but what a way to live. We had a very a very interesting tour guide, she explained everything In details that we didn't see the time passing! We started at 08 am, and left the palace almost 3 pm and it was very hot and humid and became very crowded!"
"Massive place, we went on a sunday and was very crowded. the temple complex itself is very large with several gates. we went up up the mountain which provided awesome views of the forbidden city"
An amazing expanse of buildings and history. The former emporers certainly believed in building everything big! With this site being next to Tiananmen Square; you have to include this in your tour schedule as it would be a shame to miss.
"We visited the forbidden city in the first week of April, during spring festival period. We were unaware that it was spring festival time during our visit to Beijing; if you are not familiar with this, it's a three day holiday for China. This means that a lot of Chinese people take time to travel and visit the main sights which included the forbidden city. For us, this meant that the forbidden city was completely filled up with people, not at all what we had expected. It was quite literally a case of pushing and shoving our way through a throng of people, hearing various tour guides in a short distance of each other trying to out shout each other in different languages as they were providing information to their listeners and ultimately at the garden area at the end practically forcing our way through the crowds.

Of course we never expected to see a completely empty palace (that's reserved for the movies I would imagine) but we'd hoped for some peace and quiet and this you just cannot expect during spring festival (as the receptionist at our hotel and various other local people we talked with during the course of our holiday readily agreed). It did however take away from any enjoyment we could've had from visiting the forbidden city.

Now, I understand that this is not the fault of the forbidden city itself and I must commend the speed which with we could buy tickets and get through security given the absolute mass of people present (in comparison, consider the Louvre in Paris where we visited several times but just didn't bother the last time because the line was over a mile long, snaked across two courtyards and would have taken hours (yes, I am aware of booking online but we didn't do so the last time)) but the fact is that due to the number of visitors they also had to perform crowd control measures. Several areas seemed to be blocked off, including buildings that clearly had displays present explaining details and various museum employees were present here and there to try and forcibly guide the mass of people in the right directions and stop them from straying off the beaten path.

One thing that struck us as amazing was that somewhere past the second or third gate into the compound we actually saw a parent help their child relieve themselves in a corner of the palace. I can understand now why they close the museum on Mondays for maintenance.

Do note that as of the time of the review the front entrance is under renovation so the left and right side is completely up in scaffolding, thus losing a photo opportunity with the full gate and sides in profile.

As a result of our experience at the forbidden city we actually chose not to go to the Great Wall because our receptionist also suggested that if we were unhappy at Forbidden City we would very likely be even more unhappy at the Great Wall given how popular it is. So, if you want to visit, make sure you get a very early visit in (we arrived at 10.30am during our visit) and make sure you avoid public holidays!"
Lots to see & take in the guide was very knowledgable we was here for an hour which is long enough loads of nice pictures to be taken
"Certainly not to be missed, but if you want to see it all, it will take many hours. I found it as awe inspiring as any temple or relics in Egypt. You can take a guide or hire an automatic tour with headphones in most languages. It will determine where you are automatically and give you an informative description if the history and significance of the site. I spent 3 hours, and I think I saw about half of the grounds. Very crowded."
"I have dreamt of seeing this place ever since I first studied about China. My advise is to watch the move ""The Last Emperor"" before you visit what was known as the ""Forbidden City"", The Palace, had 7000, mini ""palace"" quarters and ministries within. It really is a remarkable place. The craftsmanship, the architecture, the bureaucracy in how it must have operated at the time is beyond to imagine at when most of the world was backward.
I was also sad to imagine how the cultural revolution may have caused a lot of neglect destruction of this historical magnificence place. Though the Government is renovating, I wish they would not change some of the original features in order to appease the purely the tourist industry.
To truly appreciate this place read up on it or watch the ""Last Emperor"" and when you see the very seat where the last Emperor sat and was than later told by a little communist to leave, you will feel a little sad.
It is a days tour, the place is huge, were comfortable shoes, and do your own research as the locals don't have a clue! I was with a government official."
"This is a very large empty place where everything interesting has been removed to Taiwan. If you must spend time here, it is better to hire a guide to tell how it was. I have lots of visitors from the U.S. and Finland who want to see it, but realize, after spending 3 hours inside, that the area outside, and directly around, the Palace (Forbidden City) is more interesting. If you only have a day or two in Beijing you should skip this one."
Everything is amazing on and off film there. Drom the entire grounds of the Palace and the Dragon Boat rides on the lake approaching the 17 arch bridge are just unforgettable. Certain areas have trees that have a natural camouflage in the bark of the tree. All the bridges have particular individual charms connected by the abundance of weeping willows along the shore edges.
"The Forbidden City, the former home of China's Emperors and their entourage must be seen to be believed. A huge complex as large as a town itself made up of inner and outer buildings denoting the public and private life of the emperor.
You need a good guide or a very good guide book as walking around on your own becomes meaningless and tiring.
As good as the history and spectacle is the opportunity to people watch (and be watched as the Chinese are fascinated by non-Chinese) is amazing.
You will need to go prepared: water, comfy walking shoes and be prepared for crowds.
This is an experience not to be missed."
Dont miss to visit this place. Preferably weekday where the crowd is much lesser than weekend. The place is so huge with so many buildings to visit and learn about the history. Nice architecture as well
"I live in Beijing and often have to take people round the 'Forbidden City' (Old Palace, Gu Gong) in Chinese and I don't like it much. If you have the option, you can look at it from above by going to Jing Shan park, just north of it, where the hill was made from the soil of the moat and get great views thrown in. You can also get the idea without sore feet from the 'lama temple' which was originally a smaller, copy palace a kilometre or so to the north or so. It is, indeed, massive. You enter from the south, Tien An Min Square (and what a sense of empty braggadocio that has) and buy your ticket. The there is a series of very similar presentation halls and courtyards. You can't go into the halls and they are not lit inside, who knows why. Rush past these: they were used infrequently (Ci Xi, the last Dowager Empress never went into them or the courtyards around them), they have no heating; they are just big rooms. Everyone lived in smaller accommodation round the back and side of the palace. So, after coming down off the mound of the 4th such hall, turn right in front of the cafe and pay a little extra to see the palace treasures. These are, themselves, a bit rubbish (the Nationalists took all the good stuff to Taiwan in 1949) but you get to see the places where people lived, where the concubines passed the day and the theatre where the second last Emperor obsessively put on Beijing Opera. This takes you round to the exit at the end. Once out you will be in a vast, pullulating mob, decorated by deformed people begging. I always go as fast as possible to the right, cross the road at the crossing and enter Jing Shang park (small cost) 100m up the road opposite on the left to regain balance. The smart money does this first and then avoids the footsore need to look respectful at boring rooms altogether."
"This is full of history, read up before you go. Also climb the man-made hill to the north, spectacular views of Beijing"
"We were pretty disappointed in the Forbidden City -- you can't see much in terms of interiors and it's really just a big compound with lots of buildings -- albeit beautiful ones, but if you've spent any time in the Far East you'll be familiar with the architecture. It's massive and teeming with tourists. If the weather is hot make sure you go early and take an umbrella to shield you from the sun because there is no shade. The entrance is on the south end so make sure your taxi driver drops you off at the right gate. We had to hop on a bus to the other end. The clock museum is very cool - loads of really impressive clocks from around the world. We did not have a guide but got the audio guides, which were good and very inexpensive."
"Such a treat to stroll around this huge site, so much to see and explore - our small kids loved it - especially when they got to dress up as royalty!"
"On day one we went to the Hutong where the lesser official lived. A day or so later, we went to the very heart of Imperial China's power base, the Forbidden City, AKA The Palace Museum. It is impossible to see the extent of this place, much less describe even the small portion one can see in a half-day spent touring it. It is massive, exquisite, fanciful, menacing and rather sad all at the same time. For example, an interior watercourse is designed like a curved bow with multiple marble points that signify arrows to act as guardians. And there are guardians in the form of mythical animals that adorn the roofs.

I would imagine, it would be worth anyone's while to go back for closer looks in different areas, with a good guide book and a local guide for at least some of those days.

You get a real sense of how isolated rulers can become or can make themselves. This seat of power lasted for about six hundred years before the last dynasty collapsed. We are all fortunate that it is still standing so we can see what the folly of yesterday was and perhaps get an idea of what the current foolish obsessions are in our own world before they too collapse on us all."
apart from the greatwall a highlight of beijing can be tough on a very hot day. take an umbrella if so
"What a great place, so massive and beautiful, just like everything the Chinese do! Just close to the Tian An Men Square and full of tourists, both Chinese and foreign! Lots of pictures to be taken!!"
Very impressed with the sheer scale of The Palace Museum. It is a massive part of the history in Beijing and a definite must. I enjoyed just strolling around looking at the ancient buildings and sculptures. It was a Chinese holiday when we were there so very busy but it's so large you wouldn't even notice. I really enjoyed outside the museum because the moat is something else with all the willow trees.
"This place is huge. Recommended 3-4 hours at least if you enjoy the arts and relics. Try to start early. I do suggest to come during the opening time, so that you will have time to cover lots of the area. Plus it is not that hot during the morning."
"if not the map and guide, maybe we would be lost at this historical site. Too many people here, we couldn't view someplaces very well, that's a pity anyway. However, bad and good points together is a common, the Love-tree with a beautiful and romantic story at the royal garden have given us a deep impression, we love it and good wish to all the younger and elder couples. Just like us !"
"I have loved this place. Wonderful, beautiful, full of history. I felt I could understand better China and it's history after going there.
Please if you only see one thing in Beijing, this is the place to visit."
"Wow, what can I say about the Forbidden City? I couldn't believe how big it was for a start, you seemed to walk from one courtyard into another, into another, and into another. The Hall of Treasures was a must, especially with some of the translations on the air conditioner units (see photo's!). I think it was quite expensive to visit, but worth every penny. Even in the 4 hours we were there, we didn't see all of it! My sister in law (who is chinese) had arranged a personal tour guide, Alan who we found very helpful, but having said that on comparing notes with my mother, we were told different things, and neither match with what's on the internet!! I would advise 'boning up' before you go tho!"
"I guess my husband and I visited the palace museum (aka the forbidden city) at the wrong time. It was during a Chinese holiday and we were literally swamped by people!! We lined up for security check outside of Tiananmen square at 8am but already the place was filled with people. Once inside, we did not get a lot of chance to walk around as there were people literally everywhere. The place itself is HUGE and definitely worth the visit although it is best to avoid Chinese holidays."
"I think that if you did this on your own, you would be walking around this Forbidden City all day long. We did a private tour which helped us get through the highlights and understand what we were seeing. This place is dazzling and something you do not want to miss. I know there were guides out front offering to take you for a tour for a fee, but since we were there with a guide to see some of the main sights for the day, I can't comment on that. This is not to be missed."
"The palace museum (formerly Forbidden City) is interesting. There are lots of extra charges (entrance fee, separate fees for different areas of the museum, fees for the gps operated guide). There are many tours that move fast through the property."
"The Palace Museum otherwise known as the Forbidden City.
This place is so big you can never really see or experience all of it in just one day.
Enjoy the view from the first two squares and buildings they are what it think are the most special. Afterwards the builds start to look all the same, but the view across the square from the first two buildings is the same pictures you saw when you want to visit this place to begin with."
"Loved the Forbidden City. We had an elderly lady named Massa approach us on the way in. She charges 200 rmb for 3 hours of guiding us around the museum. She moved In and out of long lines with practice and rattled of trivia about the complex. I was impressed.

One downside was our stop at the very nice tea shop on the grounds. Great information on Chinese tea a me tea service BUT a huge rip off on the pricing. They had chrysanthemum flower tea for $5 a bud. I bought some. I later bought the same tea for $1. Oh well."
"This Palace Museum called Forbidden City is on one side of the Tienanmen Square in Beijing China.

The Chinese architecture is simply amazing. The beautiful roofs are one of the most interesting things to see.

In the front are a pair of lions guarding the museum. They are always in pairs for good luck. You may rub them for good luck too.

Inside the Forbidden City are many wonderful buildings which show how the Emperors and their staff lived such a lavish lifestyle. The Emperors had hundreds of wives and concubines so their lifestyle was unique.

China has refurbished many of the pagoda style buildings. They are made primarily of wood so preservation is very important so that future generations can still come and visit this spectacular museum.

You may look inside glass windows where you can see the furnishings that the tenants used during their stay at the forbidden city.

The site is extensive so give yourselves 1 to 2 hours to see everything.

The importance of this sight will increase in the future as the lifestyle of Chinese people is drastically changing. Many now live in cookie cutter high rises which is so different than how they used to live. This Museum takes you back in time to see how the Chinese Royalty lived behind closed walls."
When visiting try to go in the morning since they now close the entrance at 3:30 p.m. - a must number one place to visit after the Great Wall.
"The Forbidden City is impressive, no doubt. However we found it to be crowded and just more and more of the same. We rushed through in about an hour - and that was all we needed. There was no point pushing to the front for a brief ""peek"" inside the roped off buildings. Our guide had little to say which likely did not help. The only attractions we enjoyed in Beijing were the Great Wall and the streets south of Tian'anmen Square. I preferred the Summer Palace - it is not as grand, but is more beautiful and unique."
"Before you visit the Forbidden City, try to watch the Last Emperor movie... it will give you an idea of the splendor this place once had.

Beijing Bus / Subway Search

For me the best is to get a machine guide at the entrance 100 rmb per unit, it activates on its own as you walk through it... not information overload, and you wont missed the interesting details that otherwise you would overlooked... and if you had enough you don't have to listen to it.... you return it at the end of your visit at the exit.

Hope it helps...have fun."
"Yes as other have said it is a lot of courtyards, but if you have a knowledgable guide to tell you the stories and history it is a good visit. We were approached by people claiming to be students to ""see their artwork"" we ducked out of that. But a older woman offered to guide us, we paid her 200 RMB and bought her 1/2 price ticket 20RMB, plus our 2 tickets @ 40 RMB each. She zipped us past the line to get in and gave us a 2 hour tour. She had great stories to tell about the emperors and their women. She was wonderful about answering our questions and shepherding us around. Very knowledgeable. I had heard not to get a guide but am very happy we did. Once outside THE PALCE MUSEUM she took us to a garden and we had a tea ceremony. First price quoted 100RMB /person, then for both of us. Actually we bought some tea and they did not charge for the tea ceremony:-) it was a government run tea shop and prices were good. Our sales person was very knowledgeable with good English very enjoyable and I'm not a tea drinker LOL Nice way to spend the day and it was not crowded."
"Chinese People are great, our root come from Mainland of China, all members of my family are glad to be one of them. Interesting place to look around. but too many people here, little crowed."
"even though there are lots of travelors coming, we still have a good time here and this place have printed deep impression on our mind. Chinese People are so amazing ! we are proud of their great achievements."
"If you like Chinese architecture and aesthetics, this is the place. You can fill the might imperial power. If you do not like chinese architecture, after the second hall you will be looking for the exit"
"The Palace Museum is huge and packed with tourists, but still something you have to see when in Beijing. Be careful about all the offers you will get from people wishing to be your tour guide; you might be up for being scammed if you seem the least interested! You can get an audio guide for a small sum, which is good (and exists in a lot of languages!) is controlled by a GPS sensor and has a map on the backside. Quite handy! There is much to see, but also quite a few nice places to sit down if you want to just read a book or relax. You should defiantly spend a few hours here, so come sometime before noon as it closes at 4.30 pm (if i remember correctly). If it is a sunny day bringing lunch is a great idea!"
Oh My God !!! This place is terrible! I went with 8 people and none of them liked it ! I would highly recommend you not to go hear as they are only courtyards inside courtyards inside courtyards. There are rooms but we cant go inside. Maybe our guide wasn't nice or I dont know. .Once you get in you can only get out from the exit You would be needing walking shoes and you must be in proper shape I saw a lady who slipped and fractured her hand.Sorry but I didn't like this place.
I was lucky to have a guide who has extensive knowledge that was able to provide me with I wanted to know. I will go back again on my next trip to Beijing.
"Like all visitors to Beijing we were looking forward to visiting the palace. We were intending to go on a Monday but fortunately spotted on the web site that from 1st Jan it closes on Mondays. Both our guidebooks, being written last year did not mention this.
So on Tuesday we arrived at Tiananman Square Metro station. It took almost one and a half hours to get into the square through the security. We discovered later that it was even worst an hour later, I am afraid this put us in a bad mood before we even got into the Palace.

We hired the audio guide which was factual but dull, it didn't tell a story in an interesting way. All the buildings are very much the same as each other and you can't go in any of them, all you can do is peer through the windows into badly lit rooms.

There were many thousands of visitors which made the whole experience hard work. If you visit Beijing then you ought to visit the Forbidden City, otherwise it would be like visiting Athens and not the Acropolis or Cairo and missing the Pyramids but I suggest you go as late as possible in the afternoon to reduce the security queue time and just do a few buildings. Whatever you do don't set your expectations too high."
"Extremely huge place with layers and rows of rooms, full of rich Chinese history in the realm of emperors and empress. So much authenticity of skillful workmanship in walls, doors, windows, floors, towers, rooms, gardens, ... Worth seeing more than twice."
"This is a fantastic place, a must see if you are in the city. It is a huge place with lots of history to see and breath. After entering the city there is a small store on the left where they sell pictures and draws, the sellers try to drag you there and sell something, my advice for you is ""go there and buy something"" :) The draws are originals, handmade, beautiful and amazing pieces of art and the price is OK. No need to fear them, I bought just one draw and I regret it, should have bought at least 5 more. Great place, a must see."
"The whole complex is clearly impressive but, alas, everything seemed a little gloomy/dusty. You peer into the Palace of Heavenly-Something etc - and you just feel 'gosh this would be so so good if just someone gave it a tad of a clean/brush up'. I'm not saying falsely restore everything but all seems unduly faded (over and above it's age). Even all the pottery in the exhibitions (in their cabinets) seemed to have a layer of dust on them which detracted from the potential 'wow' factor.

There are lots of tourists in groups but they seemed to follow a rapid-transit route i.e. in thru Gate A, block-up 'key' viewing points, take zillion of photos - and out thru Gate B.

There are many rooms and exhibitions off to either side (not always clearly signposted) so make sure you meander off and visit. There was even one exhibition room we thought was closed until the security guard open the door to let us in. It was simply just that no one had gone in/found it. Bizarre. We were the only people in there.

Under a blue-sky I am sure the whole complex would have a greater chance to shine thru."
"If you will miss this next time in Beijing, then you'll gonna miss Tienanmen Square (the palace is situated north to the square), Mao's funeral and Qianmen Street shopping area, too ... so you will miss the whole Beijing.
Therefore, put it as a must, in order to understand what ""BIG"" really means."
"I won't say a lot because it's already been said. Be prepared for crowds as it is world famous, but so worth it. The crowds don't cramp though, as this is so huge and grand. Give yourself plenty of time. This is a once in a lifetime experience."
"enjoyable and pleasant, like it very much. special the love tress at the Royal Garden in the inner palace of Forbidden City. loving story. touched very much."
"Very nice historical building, but the maintenance seems not doing well. The furniture and decorations of each room are impressive."
"Two things to know:
It is crowded, so be ready to be pushed around.
It is closed on Mondays (luckily we strolled in on a Wednesday)

Entrance is 40 RMB. And yes it is as majestic as seen on movies (well they don't have the crowd)"
"Visiting the Forbidden City has been a bucket list item for me, ever since I watched The Last Emperor, and every other historical Chinese film thereafter. The sheer scale of the property and its buildings is absolutely massive, and awe-inspiring.

There are 2 subway exits in front of the museum, making it easily accessible. But you do have to go through airport-like security checkpoints, and wade through rivers of people to get into the compound. Entrance fee is very cheap, less than $10 US, which surprised me. That price has implications - on one hand, it means the museum is very accessible to the public, which is a great thing. On the other hand, it's so accessible, the crowds begin to suffocate you.

I didn't feel the hushed reverence one normally witnesses, when visiting a historically important monument. Instead, you have dozens of large tour groups, tour group leaders shouting above one another to coral their clients, tourists foreign/domestic scrambling to take photos of the few things that are on display.

In general, there isn't much on display. You see the buildings, and there are few pavilions which show receiving/thrown rooms with original furniture pieces, but you can't see anything because the entrances are blocked by dozens of tourists clammering for glimpse. You aren't allowed inside, there are 2 guards inside the displayed pavilions at all times, and doors are blocked. As magnificent as the specimens were, inside - it was a shame to see these artifacts/antiques covered in layers of dust, no lighting inside, to highlight their beauty.

There are a few ""exhibits"" but the Clock exhibit was closed when I went; I payed another $5 to enter the Hall of Treasures and walked into the hallway showcasing Jewelry. It was a rip-off, to say the least.

the Imperial Garden was the best part of the musuem to be honest, ancient trees in gnarled shaped, well preserved pavilions with amazing painted carvings inside. There was a 2-story structure were Puyi was said to have been taught English by his Oxford tutor - again, you're not allowed inside.

In all, beautiful property. But it's just a shell, with well-preserved exterior, only. I was expecting vignettes, at least, depicting what everyday life might have been during imperial times. A bit of education, to round out the whole tourist experience of simply taking pictures would have been nice.

I still think it's a must, if you're in Beijing. I managed to cover the area in 4 hours, with one of those guided tour ear pieces (you pay extra for this, but I didn't think it was worth it.)"
"It's most certainly impressive by history and culture but if I had a day or two in Beijing and had to choose I'd prefer the Summer Palace over this . Luckily I got to see both and more as I had enough time on my hands . May be because I was travelling with a huge group I wasn't as impressed as I expected to be . Still one must visit it if in Beijing but this wasn't the highlight for me . Inexpensive entry and quite easy to get round it . It's massive , will take a good few hours to walk around it so don't rush . Good photography opportunities ."
"Definitely a must visit spot. All should visit this old palace cum museum. You will find a lot of artifacts, collections, and all types of memorials item there. no one should ever miss this place. must visit when u are in beijing"
"This is a must see if your in Beijing. You can spend a long time here, as the walk is over a mile long.

There are several different sections that require payment to get into - IE; the clock gallery, but it is worth it to spend the whole day and to see everything.

It seemed pretty busy to me, being a westerner, but apparently it was quiet when I went. In the summer, it is meant to be really busy. I would sure hate to see it when it was busy"
"This place is very busy and kind of boring. We expected great things and were disappointed. If you are pushed for time then visit Summer Palace instead, it's great. You can reach it on the subway."
"It is said that long ago girls in China dreamt to enter the palace as concubines but only to confine herself in this colossal city. And only chosen few realized their dreams. Now once forbidden receive approx 80,000 footfall daily and off course exist.

The palace is huge and need time to see each and every corner of the palace. One could see influence of Buddhist everywhere in the building whether its swastika or image of Buddha himself.

One could peep into lives of former kings by visiting their living rooms, dinning rooms etc, however, one could disappointed by seeing every rooms has been occupied by shopkeepers and palace turns out to be a market. one wonder why so many shops selling souvenir...it would have been better if only two such shops at entry and exist..."
"This is a must see on the trip to China and it was outstanding to take a tour through the Forbidden City, it is a bit of a tourist train through the place but worth it. You need to take a tour group through the place to get the best out of it."
"the number of adjectives you could use to describe the palace museum is almost endless... opulent, grandiose, impressive, awesome, etc. upon entering, i seriously had to pinch myself that i was inside the forbidden city.

entrance is through the south gate, which is accessible from tiananmin gate/square or through the less crowded entrance along donguamen road, where there is also a tourist trolley stop (2rmb) should you want to avoid walking. given how relatively short and pleasant the walk is between the stop at the east gate and the entrance and how much you'll be walking anyway, it doesn't seem like it's worth it. keep in mind that you'll probably have at least 10 people come up and ask you if you want a tour before you enter. on a similar note, the forbidden city is not the place to wear your heels, as you will do an insane amount of walking. furthermore, if you visit in the winter, as i did, make sure you wear very warm clothing - you will be spending almost the entire visit outside and beijing is very cold in the winter; don't get frostbite because you're unprepared.

the ticket queue was actually super organized and arranged to discourage any line jumping. even though it looked long, the line moved quickly and it was very easy to get tickets. however, there is a different line for the audio tours and that line moved so slowly we decided to skip it. while the visit was still incredibly enjoyable, i am sure it would have been even better with the audio tour, which not only is less expensive than a guide, but also less annoying, since you can go at your own pace.

given the size, you will never see everything before you get tired or perhaps even bored. i say bored because you can't really see explore the interiors of the buildings and the exteriors, although stunning, start to look the same. there are lots of benches and snack bars/restaurants scattered throughout when you need a break. and while the map was only printed in chinese, there is plenty of english signage.

after you finish exploring, if you can muster any energy try to end your visit by heading to jingshan park, just across the street from the north gate exit. for 2rmb you'll be able to get a bird's eye view of the magnificent palace you just explored on foot."
"Forbidden City is a good place to start your day and local Tour and proceed towards the Great Wall in the afternoon. Usually starts at Tienanmen Square or the South Gate proceeding from the outer temples into the inner most part consisting of the Courtyard, Emperor's Room, Empress's Rooms, Rock Garden and finally exiting out of the North gate. The most interesting piece of information shared was about one of the Emperor having 300+ Country Wives and who were never allowed to leave the palace. The Fun spoiler is that you are not allowed to go inside the rooms of the emperor, empress or any other buildings even though it would have been good to see it little closer from inside rather than seeing it from outside through the many windows."
"The Forbidden City or The Palace is an incredible place to visit. We went with a tour guide so that we could hear all the history behind the palace, the emperors and empress' which made it 100% better. From the outside, you know the palace is large but when you get inside, it is amazing to see the rooms and how great they are decorated, especially for the time. From the entryway where you can feel the power to the intricate paintings and carvings to the stunning rock garden, it is just breathtaking. When you walk through, it is also very interesting when you think that many of the women (wives or concubines) and even children were never allowed to leave the palace...it gives you a whole different perspective. Overall, the palace is in great shape and they are doing renovations to keep up with the aging. It should be on everyone's itinerary and if you have middle aged children, encourage them to read a book on Puyi or see The Last Emperor as a family so you have some background before coming."
"Similar to the Great Wall, if you are having a holiday in Beijing the Forbidden City is one of those places you simply must go to. It would be like going to London and not looking at Big Ben if you don't. To fully appreciate your visit I recommend going as part of a tour group so that you can gain a better understanding of the palace and the purpose of the various parts. You cannot help but be amazed at the architectural wonder of the place. There is a lot of walking involved to walk from the north end to the south so wear a decent pair of shoes. The day I went was a freezing cold February day with snow on the ground and in the air and the whole place had somewhat of a mystic feel."
"We started at Tiananmen, braving the crowds through the metal detectors, then get your ticket for the Forbidden City off to the left. Walk from the south gate through all the outer temples into the inner part with beautiful trees and gardens. Then out and to the left to cross under the street. Climb the hill for an amazing photo opp back over the whole Forbidden City and 360 degrees all around. Great way to spend a half day in Beijing! Then head west into the neighbourhoods to see the lakes, walk the hutongs and grab some great local food."
"Suggest you see this attraction before you see the temple of heaven or summer palace. Those two attractions have great views in parks / lake side settings whereas the forbidden city with its temple after temple has so much history. Must go see this when in Beijing but I had seem so many other temples by the time I visited this - for me it lost some of the impact,"
"No trip to Beijing would be complete without a trip to the Forbidden City. I've visited several times in the past and always enjoy a leisurely stroll around the grounds. The area of the city is huge, so be prepared for lots of walking, however don't expect to see that much other than the iconic photos you've probably already seen.

Whilst the city is a marvellous construction, it's hard to get a sense of how it must have been original since most the of rooms and courtyards are now empty and just shown ""as is"". However, for a extra fee, you can visit the clock museum and treasure museum which has a few interesting artefacts.

Like most places in China, the Palace Museum is swamped with people, so don't expect many quite moments or clear photo opportunities (unless you go on a heavily polluted day as I did). Generally speaking there are less people in winter but this is also the time of year when the city feels most dull due to the lack of vegetation. The city certainly feels more 'alive' in summer.

Winter admission fee is 40 RMB (Jan 14) and an extra 10 RMB for each extra museum. You probably want to allow around 3-4 hours for a good visit. Personally I recommend starting at Qianmen subway station and walking across Tiananmen square, visit at Mao's Mausoleum, and then on to the Forbidden City (south entrance). You can then exit the city from the north side and directly across the road is the Jingshan Park."
"Since we were on an organized tour, I can’t give much advice about the Palace Museum except to say that it is a must see if you’re in Beijing. Just inside the gate is actually the Imperial City where high-ranking officials lived and worked. The inner city is the Forbidden City. The outer court is where the Emperor ruled and the inner court is where the Emperor lived. Unfortunately, some of the structures were under renovation, although I must say, it is much needed. Construction on The Forbidden City was started in 1406 and completed in 1420 and some of the bricks we walked on were original. It's a fascinating look at Chinese history."
"Mind blowing!

To think Humans with no machines made this place is insane,

If you are over walking everywhere I would not suggest visiting here unless you are full of energy. Otherwise you will get to the point of ""really another courtyard????""

Get those runners ready because this place is awesome!"
"Simply magnificent palace complex! It can get really hot during the summer and there's not a lot of shade until you get near the garden area (I went last summer, it was blistering), but overall, this is a must see."
"Since I saw the movie ""The last emperor"" for the first time back in the days when my family just got satellite-tv I knew I wanted to see the forbidden city, as always when something is forbidden you want it, right?
So on my trip to Beijing this was really my first stop on my schedule. For an entrance fee of 60 yuan and an additional 40 yuan for the audio guide you are set to go. The museum attracts quite a crowd that you might not notice that much in the wide open spaces but on the smaller yards and in the smaller gardens you will notice and the Chinese is quite self possessed sometimes.
Anyway sadly at least I had a few flaws with my audio guide it did not pick up where I was all the times, it gets its location I would guess by some sort of RID tags ore something and sometimes it refused to pick it up. Also at the end it could went all dead and then all of a sudden return to life. Given these problems I although thought it was ok. What disturbed me more was that there was 3 or so of the different courtyards that where closed without notice and that I felt was a little bit annoying, they could at least have informed about it and maybe mentioned a time frame for their closure.
But of course I do recommend everyone going to Beijing to visit the forbidden city, or as it should be called, The palace museum. It is a piece of the old China and really is a must see. Given the heavy air pollution in Beijing the site is in different conditions, but I really hope that the administration of it does its best to keep this piece of history for future generations to see."
"This, for me, is the number one attraction in Beijing, even more so than the great wall. When you enter the first courtyard it's impressive, but the second is even more grand. The architecture and scale of the place is epic, but part of the experience is getting lost down the narrow corridors which branch off the central North/South axis. The Imperial Garden is beautiful, and the clock museum is a treasure trove of ornate creations.

Expect hordes of crowds and queues for tickets, food and toilets. If you want to get a glimpse inside the rooms, be prepared to push your way to the front of a scrum. This is China - patience and consideration are minimal - but it's all part of the fun, and the complex is so large that you can still find space to relax and enjoy the spectacle. At 40 yuan for entry, plus an extra 10 yuan each for the clock museum and treasure museum, it's a bargain. If you leave through the north gate, Jingshan park is right across the road, where you can climb the hill for a stunning view over the roofs. I was there for 4 hours and felt this was enough, but then I didn't go in the treasure museum. Definitely allow at least half a day. And I didn't bother with the audio guide - there are English information boards at each of the main halls which I found to be informative enough."
So much history at this place! Don´t underestimate it: you will need a full day to make a proper visit to the Forbidden City. And don´t forget to take the audio guide.
Bit samey/lacking interesting information--v. chinese in that respect. But fantastic history and brilliant especially if you can relate it to previously researched stuff.
"This area was once known as the Forbidding City, I suggest taking another look at the last emperor (the movie) for a better understanding of why it is not called this. We walk this with a private tour guide, it was worth the extra money. There about 14 door each having a large court yard between some with buildings and others with a garden. If you visit in the winter there is less of a large crowd. We had an eleven hour layover on our way to Australia and was able to see the Great Wall and the Palace Museum with tea and lunch. The tour guide was very informative because she was raised in China and studied the History in school. Walking from the main gate all the way to the other end (gate 14) it took about 3 hours. After 11 hours on a flight and another 5 seeing the Great Wall including traveling to, this time at the Palace was well worth it. I am learning how young America is. More then one camera may be smart."
"This place has some much on display that one would need at least one full morning to appreciate amount of information provided. A camera would be very useful to capture the exhibits in pictures for later viewing. There were many visitors but this place is so big that a very huge crowd to fill it up. There a security check for everyone in a long queue, but it did take long to get through."
"We arrived at about 10:30 to find less people than we expected, and found the reason was the Museum closes early on Mondays. However, due to the lesser crowds, we were able to see most of the points of interest in the allowed time and enjoyed the morning. Leaving, the cabs are all waiting and all had ""broken meters"" and quoted prices 2-3 times the ""meter"" rate, so we got on a city bus, heading who knows where, for 1 Yuan (about 17 cents) and got off several stops later. We explored the area and took a cab back to our hotel and the meter worked.

Well worth the stop."
We've all seen the place in The Last emperor but the actual size and scope is not apparent until one actually walks into the Forbidden City complex. Amazing! I studied Chinese history so it was quite an experience to walk off the busy (and small) streets into this imperial preserve. Explains detachment from the masses. It is truly one of the hot spots to visit (and the public square just outside in another historic space but for different reasons).
"There is so much to see here and the complex is made up of so many courtyards, rooms and spaces that you could easily spend a day or more here. Unfortunately we were rushed through in a morning on our Travelsphere tour and I only got a glimpse of what was there. The buildings are amazing and there is so much meaning behind everything, you really need a guide to appreciate it. The main buildings look really colourful ( were re-painted for the olympics), but the older ones show their history much more. It's beautiful, humbling, and really worth taking time to see it properly. Some areas were really crowded but after 2 weeks in China we were used to this and especially the non queuing, push as you like culture! Don't take it personally just go with the flow."
"This is impressive and consists of several buildings, walkways, bridges across water (frozen in January) and large squares.
You really do need a guide to get the most out of this.
You cannot go into the buildings but can look in from the outside although this is a bit of a crush. We went in January when it was quite busy - I am told is horrendously crowded in summer.
This is a must see but we preferred the Temple of Haven."
"It was unique in my experience, in terms of beauty, size, and significance. Come early and stay late. You won't be able to take it all in. The atmosphere is impressive, if at times oppressive."
"Very exotic and historical place. I recommend you go with a tour guide, so you can understand everything that went on and also many stories about the emperors!"
"This is most commonly called the Forbidden City by Westerners, but that is incorrect as the
Forbidden City is only one part of the site. Regardless it could be easily called one of the wonders of the world, almost beyond explanation, to see and walk in the places where history was made for 600 years is humbling. This city was the home of many emperors of China built before Columbus discovered the America's. Well preserved and easy to navigate, kudos to the Chinese people for their carful attention to detail and preservation. Do not miss this site.
We hired a private guide, not expensive approx $50.and the guide made the experience much more interesting. Everything is in both Chinese and English."
"When you see this place, you will see a tremendous historical heritage. A very extensive palace complex. You could imagine how rich this kingdom."
"One could easily spend all day wandering around this humongous complex of halls, courtyards, and mini museums. Many of the main halls have been maintained, whereas most of the side buildings have been converted to mini museums that house ceramics, weapons, manuscripts, clothing, and all sorts of other neat stuff. I would recommend going straight through the middle of the complex and then exploring the Treasure Museum next. Then go to the other side areas (although you may be tired of all of the little temples and museums by this point. We were). If you exit via the North gate, you can go straight into Jingshan park for some great views of the city! Bring your own food to avoid being over charged and disappointed!"
"Just found out that now it was known as Palace museum, used to be Forbidden city. Taking the metro exiting Tianment East line 1 cost RMB 2/trip at any stop. Queue for ticket about 10 minutes, pay RMB 40/person for entrance. From watching all those movies with forbidden city scene, we have really high expectation, possibly because missing all those massive guard or palace staff that we find in the movies, it was so so but it worth a visit to the world's largest palace complex. we enjoy the imperial garden near the exit. In the entry and exit gate, you will find many sales offering trip to great wall, taxi, car rent, tour guide, etc. quite surprise when we found out that we can not exit the same way that we enter. We try to reach MRT from the front gate but walking back would be too far, I know we will get lost with my poor chinese trying to read all those sign and bus route, thanks my dad who read well and ask another passanger inside the bus, we manage to take reach our hotel. Bus fare cost only RMB 1/person. Taxi fare is not expensive, just make sure you did not take illegal taxi with no meter, normal taxi charges in Beijing start at RMB 13."
"Needed a guide as we had 2 hours and the Queen's area was open, which was unusual. This is more for history buffs as I find it same-same and there were no insights or secrets that intrigued me. Good exercise though."
"I am referring to the gift shop that is obvious about halfway through the Forbidden City. I found many unique things and beautiful things there. Red lacquer items, paper cuttings, painted wooden combs, a reproduction of the yellow emperor's robe, etc. You can also buy things from vendors outside the Forbidden City. Very cute and inexpensive are the hats of the Emperor and Empress. But don't buy from a vendor who overcharges. The first vendor I asked the price of gave me a sum six times the one the second did. Go to the old vendors. They aren't such cheats."
"We were disappointed that after so much walking from our hotel to the museum, climbing stairs and stairs, the area opened for viewing is not much! If anyone interested to buy the gifts at the gifts shop inside the museum, do check the items very careful before purchased as we bought a pair of Jing Tai Lan vases and we were careless and did not check carefully, we came back to our home and found some parts chipped off and the workmenship is bad, the vase is slanted when stand upright!!! I tried writing an email to the palace museum and attached the photos showing the flaws but they never reply! Guess there is nothing we can do about it after purchased though they kept promising us that these items are authentic, the Jing Tai Lan will not chipped off no matter how you scratch it or hit it.... Also said the price and quality is controlled by the China government..... :("
"We had a great time when we visited the Palace Museum. Earlier it was known as the Forbidden City. The place was well maintained and in top shape. The crowd here was huge, just like the whole place. We had to endure a bit of noise as there were a lot of people but everyone has the right to treat themselves to this wonderful place that is a living epitome of Chinese culture. There were the gardens called the Imperial Gardens. They were well maintained too and were a treat to look at. The whole place has an architecture worth marveling about. The palace has been designed well. There are other things here to see like an exhibition of clocks!! Then there is also an Opera House too. The entry fee is reasonable as the place is worth it. There are various sections and there is a park near the North side which is worthy of a visit too."
"Splitting up the Forbidden City for reviews seems a bit strange, it should all come under one subject, as you cannot see one without the others. However this is a great part of the whole spread of features that make up the Forbidden City. The architecture and just the feel of the place is worthwhile seeing just by itself. Cold when we were there though if going in winter rug up because there is no shelter."
Truly amazing and worth a visit. From the dressing room which is the size of a large 2 story house to the giant real gold cauldrons used to hold water incase of a fire this place is big scale on everything. We had a lovely guide who explained to us everything we wanted to know. We went in winter without the crowds and it was terrific. The moat was frozen and looked beautiful.
"This is exactly what makes the impression of ancient China, of all the palaces and oriental culture. I believe this is the place where all the movies are shot when it comes to historical Chinese movies."
"The Forbidden City has been well known around the world for its superior size considering the year it has been built. Inside the city you will find 999 room , temple, emperor throne, and many more. Truly hard to believe those people built such scale at that time and technology.
There are many history behind forbidden city : Love, traitor, invader, the fall of dinasty, and more! make sure to have a local guide to tell you the detail of those story.
Last few word : Highly recommended for those who travel to Beijing. and dont miss out the Mao Ce Tong body which can be seen in front of Forbidden City for free, but expect a long (+-3 hour in high season) queue!. Have fun! :D"
"If you have only one day for site seeing in Beijing, then this is where you should go. It is centrally located, and easy to get there from anywhere of Beijing. This is a place you can feel the history of China and appreciate the beauty of Chinese acient architecture."
"Had one day for sightseeing and shopping while on business trip. Had been told this was must see but didn't want to spend all day so went on my own without guide and it worked out fine. Easy to get to via subway, as others have commented. Nice souvenirs in the shops (wish I had purchased more there instead of the standard shopping locations I hit after). I read up on the Forbidden City before going and it helped. I'm sure I could have gotten more out of it (and spent more time there) with a guide, but it worked well for what time I had and I'm glad I went. Thanks to other reviews, I knew to ignore the rickshaw drivers at the exit. It was long, but straightforward, to walk back to the entrance and subway. Just turn right after exit and walk along the moat until you get to corner (great photo op there). Right at corner and walk until you have about decided you are lost. About then, you will come to a corner and see the palace/city on the right. Take a right and you'll soon get back to the entrance. As others have said, go when opens. Was crazy crowded when I left."
"China is gradually restoring the treasures of its past, and a great deal of work has gone into the palace, which is enormous but only partially brought back to its original glory. Visitors are, quite reasonably, not allowed inside the rooms but instead must crowd around doorways to peek in. Sometimes the displays inside are dusty and bedraggled, but keep in mind that this is a work in progress. You'll get a sore neck from gaping at all of the beautiful wonders at the palace."
"It's my second time to the Forbidden City and it still takes my breath away.

I just love walking around the halls and be awed at the splendor of the palace. I loved imagining what it was like living there.

Be prepared to push and shove your way to the front of the crowd if you want to get a good picture at the halls though."
"We had a great time walking around, so much to see. Took us 2.5hrs to get around. It was 4pm by the time we walked out. We stopped out side to see what else we can do, when a Chinese guy and lady started talking to us and asked if whey can spend some time with us as they wanted to learn more English. We didn't want to be rood so we let them walk with us, but they ended up walking us to a tea house, when the bill came it was 1600yuan!!!
Find your own way around
Don't talk to anyone that approaches you!
Great place, can't say much for the ppl!"
"Everything was fabulous, not many English speaking people but Tour Guide is the way to go. Many different tours. Rest rooms would be my only issue but not a biggy..take wipes and tissue you will be fine!!"
Everything is maintained nicely and more rooms sections of the Forbidden City should be opened to improve the traveller's experience
"I just like everything about the imperial palace!!! The history, the extend of palace, the garden, the intricate carvings, the sculptures, etc///"
"As THE largest royal residence compound in the world, it is simply one of the places in the world a person must visit at least once in their lifetime."
"The Forbidden City is somewhere you should definitely visit! I went in 2011 and I'd go back just to see the beautiful architecture again. There's so much history behind the city as well. It's a lot to take in but it's an experience one should have when in Beijing. Just remember, it's a lot of walking!"
"Bring your walking shoes and be prepare to spend the day there, its so beautiful, the architecture and the layout."
"This is the Forbidden City, since renamed as the Palace Museum following the revolutions. It is a splendid place and is the crown of Beijing itself. Thanks to those who chose to save it from the revolution, war and also those who repaired it after. The process of repair is still ongoing with the major phase for the 2008 Olympics. But in Nov 13 there was still a huge scaffolding covering one wing of the main gate of the inner courtyard.

It is still worth going - amazing place to think that this was once the private domain of the emperors of old. Be prepared for Chinese style tourism - no sense of personal space and you have to push and shove near the main buildings, these you can't really go in. But some of the smaller ones have makeshift exhibits.

The imperial gardens (separate tripadvisor entry) is also well worth looking - they moved a mountain for the emperor himself! Simply amazing!

You can queue to get a little audio guide which doubles as a map of the complex complete with little red lights to show you where you are - if there are 2 of you, queue in parallel for the guide and the other for the neckstrap, despite both windows being next to each other - Chinese bureaucracy at its best!

Take your time to appreciate the architecture and the views and connect with this spot which has lasted as an imperial centre of power since the time of Kublai Khan - the remnants of his own palace were razed to form the hill overlooking this site.

I went away feeling amazed and spent a good time afterwards watching YouTube videos of the documentaries of this place just to learn even more. Can't wait to go back too!"
"Well, six stars for the Palace Museum, it's truly a world Wonder. A shame that just a few rooms are ""open"" for the public (you can just peek insite through the open door)"
"We visited The Palace Museum (aka: The Forbidden City) and it was really an excellent tour for us from many aspects, such as the rich historical information, historical buildings, historical interior designs and furniture, and large area the Palace Museum occupies.

For us, the nice weather of the month of October contributed to the success of our tour as we think that visiting this Palace during hot weather would a little bit be exhausting as there is much walking and stair climbing in addition to the crowds."
"We arrived at 8.45am and it was relatively quiet until about 10am (although November is off-peak season). To make the most of this I think it is worthwhile doing the main bits first then coming back if you want to see some of the side attractions (opera house, clock exhibition etc.). The audio guide was worth getting but fairly temperamental and we ended up listening to things at different times – if you are in a group larger than 2 people this might be very annoying so a tour guide would probably be the best option. We ended up spending about 4hours wandering around and could have easily spent another hour or so."
"Take Metro line 1 to Tiananmen Dong (East) or Tianamen Xi (West). You can start at the Tiananmen Gate (Gate of Heavenly Peace) - this is where you see the large picture of Mao. Proceed thru the GOHP to the Meridian (South) Gate, where you pay your entrance fee.
A guide is not necessary and you can purchase an audio guide. It takes 2-4 hours depending on how much you want to see. It will always be crowded, so just go!
Note: You cannot enter at the North Gate, you must enter at the South gate. From January 1st, 2014, the Forbidden City will be closed on every Monday (except the public holidays and July 1 – Aug.31) for maintenance.

As you exit the North gate, you will see Jingshan Park directly across the street. Use the underground walkway to cross the street. You will see a pagoda high on a hill (coal hill). From Coal Hill you can take magnificent photos of the entire Forbiden City down below.

If you have the time & energy, you can exit from the the West gate of Jingshan Park for a short walk to the East gate of Behai Park, where you can catch a boat ride & relax.

Also, at night, spectacular photos of the Mao picture can be taken at the Tiananmen Gate, which is well lit at night. From there you can take a short walk to the nearby Wanfunjing St & Doughumen Night Market."
"very crowded, you do not need a tour guide, there are self guides you can rent. nothing very exciting to see except the buildings for outside , which are all the same. it is about how the emperor used to live. should not take you more than 1 hour ."
"First of all I want to said that the Forbideen City is one of the most important historical sites in China. The architecture, the marble bridges and stairs, all the monuments , no way to described them!! I went in July that was very humid and sticky, the crowds don't bother me , because every site in mainland China will be the same way, specially that it was hollidays for most local chinese from all over China, and that come to Beijing for the first time., and their dream is to see Beijing!! As they express to me.
Is my 3 visit to Beijing and I will not missed it, just to know that this historical palace it was forbidden for common people before the chinese revolution, and know is open for everybody to VISIT!! is just an amazing feeling to see all the families with their kids enjoying this complex of Palaces that is the biggest in the world. Perfectly well preserved and well maintain , clean , but most of the rooms are closed. , you can see some of them thru the glass with the old furniture inside and some museums, they have many shops around to buy books , and also they do aDVD of you flying over different places of Beijing, but that is a scam, 60RMB , I ask how long is DVD and they said 6 minutes so I decided to do it, but is only 2 and a half I just found out when I saw it at home. The audio guide is ok. The price for the palace is 60RMB or $10usd summer or winter. One good thing is that the chinese goverment don't exploit the tourists overcharging another price., like they do in Cambodia or Peru. Tourists paid the same price as local people in all the scenic spots. Tip , bring confortable shoes and water."
"The first day we tried to go to the forbidden city we ended up turning around and going back. It was an ridiculously crowded, like queuing for a rock concert. That plus the awful humidity got the better of us. The next time we went it was raining so it was a bit less crowded but there were still hoards of people everywhere. That's China I suppose!
The Forbidden City itself is impressive but all starts to look the same after the first few courtyards."
"- Unique architecture, history, culture, and displays. Great photo-op (if you can find a gap between all the visitors).

- For the wealthy: they have special private sections (behind unmarked doors) open only to VIPs with very expensive collector's items. Though most are genuine, do be aware of scams.

- There will be plenty of private tour guides and ticket sellers trying to get your business. Beware: if it is too good to be true, it often is, companies often subsidize the cost by bringing tourists to shops/stores where they make commission. Personally, I would rather spend more time seeing more of the city than spending it in these stores."
"I will skip the wonderful review on how great this place is as there are already really good reviews out there. I will focus on the practical bit.

location: its in between the 2 subway stations (both tian'anmen), either one is good.

fee: I paid RMB60 (winter price). There is a famous wall (9 dragon) which require additional RMB10 when you reach there (on the eastern side)

food: strongly suggest go with a full stomach (I grabbed a Big Mac @ WangFuJing for early lunch) and bring some drinks. There are a few lousy stalls selling overpriced lousy food and drinks.

time: I took 3 hours, and I think it was too rushed. A 4.5 hours walk will be just nice ... I downloaded an iphone App (free) and selected the 4hour tour. The app is great. Not exactly a great place to go with kids. To rush through in 2 hours will do this piece of great history injustice.

bathrooms: lots of it along the way.

Exit: You will exit at the other side of the city and it will be quite a walk back to the subway. The wind can be chilly.

Enjoy!"
"Truly a rewarding educational and historical experience. The entire area is massive and to truly experience the entire grounds and take the time to read all inscriptions you need a few hours. Well worth the price of admission. Going out the North Gate, walk straight head a short distance, turn left as you approach the rod and then go down turn left and go under the road, through a tunnel to the other side of the road that leads to a beautiful park and a mountain type view of the entire Palace. Spectacular! I suggest you take the time to read up on the the Palace Museum before you go--you will appreciate your visit all the more!"
Nice walking from south gate to north gate. Then cross the street and hike the hill. You will get the best view of the palace
"If there is only place you can visit in China, then this is it. The forbidden city has a 'wow' factor. Will take more than 1 visit to cover the whole palace. Rent the audio guides and just follow the map display on the audio guides. One word of advice, never visit this place during Chinese long holidays (i.e Week long holidays related to labour day and first week of October) unless you wanted to experience what it meant to be swarm with people !"
"I live in Beijing, I know the Forbidden City is one of the most amazing spots here. In fact, many oversea's friends of mine like to visit this place. It is very tranditional, with culture, history.....

It is a mark of Beijing, and even China!

It is very large, you have to be a marathon athlete to walk all around! :-)"
"Badly maintained and disappointing, Beijing has better attraction to offer.
It is the top on more or less everybody’s must see list when visiting Beijing,
I went there a couple of times with my visitors and everyone agreed that
There are much better places to visit before leaving Beijing."
"Beijing forbidden city is very beautiful. If you have the time and interest, you can use the google map to look from the top down and you’ll find it has oblong geometric patterns. Overall, it has strict symmetry. It was built according to the theory of five elements, symbolizing the supreme power of the emperor. Beijing forbidden city is not the biggest palace in all of the palaces in Chinese history , but it’s the most beautiful. Beijing forbidden city is good choice if you want to understand china. If you want to take a bird's-eye view of forbidden city , you can climb the top of the jingshan , across the street from the north gate of forbidden city,
Tips: Entrance: South Gate(Meridian Gate)
Exit: North Gate
Tour Route: From south to north
There isn’t a subway station near the north gate ."
"The grounds and buildings are expansive. You'll walk plenty but its almost hard to notice when you're surrounded by so much to see. It truly is a feast for the eyes. Intricate carvings, shrines, and thrones are everywhere and the detail is astounding. If you have any interest in history or a love of arts/crafts, you'll be happy you came."
"Even on a Thursday in the middle of November this place was STUFFED with people. But it spreads quite nicely once you go off the main path.
Very nice automatic audio guides to hire for 40RMB in 12 languages. Really recommendable!
Make sure you go out of the North gate and into the park onto the hill after! Great view!"
The place is endless - it will take a minimun of 40 minutes here. You should go early as it closes at 3pm. At first sight it felt weird to see a picture of the general in front of the entrance (very Comunist). But once you enter and start seeing the beauties of this place you kind forget.
"Even after my 3rd visit, I have yet to fully explore this vast and amazing palace. So much to see and explore. Engage a guide or rent a multi-lingual audio guide to better understand the history of this truly amazing complex."
"Arrived by taxi at 2pm on a sunny Friday in Nov. thru only entrance gate - from Tienamen Square. Happy that crowds weren't bad. Thx to others on TripAdvisor, knew to ignore the hawkers & walk thru several gates to get to the ticket sales on the left, and continue farther to pick up the ""automated tour guide"" - a small yellow box that hangs from your neck with an earpiece and tells what you are seeing based on where you're standing.
Most impressive for the size and amazing length of history covered in that space. Somewhat hard to see the dimly lit furnishings viewed from doorways & glass windows, but still very interesting.
On exiting, go LEFT (again, ignore pushy vendors) to the blue & white sign for steps which takes you under the busy road to lovely, quiet Jingshan Park."
"I had seen parts of it filmed in various movies, but nothing can prepare you for the vastness and grandeur of the Forbidden City. From the moment you walk over the moat and enter through large doors you are blown away by its incredible size and scale. We walked through many squares with statues of dragons and lions and cranes all built in perfect symmetry. There are massive Pavilions, Decorative Gates and Doors, Palaces, Temples and Marble Bridges to be seen and admired
.A lot of walking to be done and a lot to see so we factored in a whole morning.
Amazing!"
"Large, numerous palaces, so much to see. So many people. You should go on a guided tour because there are security gates, and you don't want to lose time waiting in line, and the guards do not speak foreign languages, nor are willing to put up with foreigners.
There so many stories to tell for all of the palaces. Would spend at least a half day here schedule allows it. Unfortunately, all the furniture and artwork inside are replica - they were taken away to Taiwan."
"Until you enter ""The Forbidden City"" you can't appreciate the size and grandeur. You won't believe you are in the middle of Beijing. Suggest visiting Jingshan Park after strolling through the Forbidden City for a spectacular view."
"I watched the movie the Last Emperor before visiting China and had no idea the size, scope, and history of the Forbidden City. From the gates to the halls to the emperors path, it was truly amazing. A place to add of everyone's bucket list."
"Vast. I've never been anywhere quite like it. Ornate gates, followed by large squares, followed by more gates."
"The palace museum, as Beijing likes to call it, but we know it as 'the forbidden city' is an enormous complex of beautiful buildings and artefacts. It tends to get quite crowded which I found a little disappointing, especially when trying to take photos that captured the beauty of the place. You can hire headsets that talk about each of the main buildings, but then you get stuck with the crowds walking from building to building. I preferred to walk around and read the signs, which are in English and Chinese, and poke my nose down less busy alleyways and buildings. The extra 10Y to see the treasure museums is well worth it, and the internal gardens are very peaceful. The museum closes quite early in 'Winter' (4.30) and the final tickets are sold at 3.30 but you really need to get there well before then, as the ticket office to the treasure museums also closes early and I saw many tourists who missed out once they got into the complex. If you do go at the end of the day, as the palace empties you can get some beautiful photos, and then the sun sets over the complex as the icing on the cake!"
"Focus on the majesty and the history of the place - the Forbidden City is truly magnificent. We visited the area 3 times - the first to scope out where it was and how to buy tickets, the second to actually go into the Palace Museum grounds, and the last time to walk the perimeter of the Forbidden City walls. It is absolutely true that the huge tourist crowds are overwhelming and that local hustlers are even more overwhelming (selling guided tours, selling souvenirs, begging for money, etc). We were constantly accosted going and leaving. Much worse, on the day we were inside the Palace, the army decided to rope off major areas of the sites inside the Forbidden City and we were pushed into a packed hoard of thousands of people squeezing into narrow passages. I actually thought we were going to get trampled but we managed to squeeze off and exit out. It was a bad experience but we did not allow it to deter it from the exquisite antiquity of the Palace itself. You need to take precautions before, after and during your visit - know what to expect and take care. But you will love the place."
"One of our highlights in Beijing. A true statement of power, impressive buildings and craftsmanship. The yards and geometry is just breathtaking. Just the history of this place is immense. To take a look and some photos at the inside the buildings you have to squeeze through the crowds, but its well worth it.
Take a guide or one of the ""electronic guides"" to take a step back in history.
Plan at least half a day if not a full day, time has no meaning here.
Be aware that on Mondays the palace is only open for half a day, and avoid the summer holidays as the crowds will be in the millions."
"Go in the morning. A great reflection of rich and long history and culture.Go early to avoid huge crowds. We were on a group tour. Place is beautifully preserved. Information boards are there, no need of a guide for a lonely traveler. Need 3-4 hours to cover."
"You simply can't miss this place if you're in the city. Yes it's crowded, the locals are loud, pushy, and some will try to rip you off. But it's a must-see: that simple."
"Today we went to see the museum palace forbidden city. I must admit that, although, I am never been a fan of chinese art, i have never seen such a magnificent royal/imperial palace in all my carear of travel specialist. I was blown away from its beaty and greatness...
You cannot miss it if you go to beijin.
Please plan at least a good half a day if you cannot take a full day.
P.s. On the contrary of many other places here also the toilets are 4 star!!!"
"It's very very impressive to see these palaces, temples, yards, roofs, trees, gardens,.... Of this place. Amazing. And it makes it so trivial to understand the gap between the rich people who lived here and the poor people all around this huge county.

AND.... when going out of the north gate we also (as several precious reviewers wrote) experienced the scheme of the rickshaw driver who took us to the subway in 3 yuan but ended up taking us to a back alley and asking us for 300 yuan. We ended up not giving them even 1 yuan more than the original 3 Yuans, due to our persistence and the fact that suddenly some ordinary Chinese citizen got into this alley and we asked for his help. But.... We could have ended up in a bad situation due to our resistance to pay these guys the money they wanted....
What a bad experience in China......"
"... by smog and crowds. It's a strange feeling as one walks around the forbidden city: despite the grandeur and sense of space, the throngs of people combine with what must be the world's dirtiest air, to create a feeling of claustrophobia. It is such a shame as the buildings themselves, the squares that carry such a strong sense of history and the small architectural details really are beautiful.
If you have lots of time in Beijing, go for it. If you only have a couple of days, give it a miss - and head for the Great Wall instead."
"Before I start about how huge and amazing this place is, I must warn about the Tea Scam Scavengers (Which interestingly turns into Coffee in the Winter :P ) and the not so young looking students who wan't to practice their english with you women. The place is filled with them at the entrance , so beware cos things can get really ugly real soon.
Other than that if you visit Beijing then you must visit the Forbidden City , it is simply a feast for your eyes and reminds you that Size Does Matter !!! The sites around them are also just too good. I remember taking around 1,500 pics."
"Before going to visit this must-see incredible historical site, I would strongly encourage you to watch the movie ""The Last Emperor"", an excellent movie directed by Bernardo Bertolucci. This movie is a fairly historical account of the final Emperor of China (there were 23 emperors before him!), parts of which were filmed on site at this very place. The Forbidden City was off limits to the common people for over 500 years. It will give you a real feel and cultural appreciation for what you are about to see. I would also encourage you to wear comfortable walking shoes as this palace is enormous and has well over 9,999 rooms! It is surrounded by a 52 metre wide moat and has China’s largest and best-preserved collection of ancient buildings. It is also known to be the largest palace complex in the world!"
"A day full of crowds and history ended with massive confusion trying to get out of the museum and then being threatened and robbed by the Rickshaw driver.
Like the previous review we also were followed by a persistent Rickshaw driver until we gave in due to a complete absence of taxis and disorganized bus system. The Rickshaw driver quoted us 3 Yuan and the proceed to drive us into a complex back alley. Once we were well away from the crowds he told us to get off, cornered us and screamed at us while we were trapped until we gave 300 Yuan per person.
I am a seasoned world traveller and have never experienced this in my life. It was the most terrifying experience I have ever had. This was obviously a ring and locals were afraid of the screaming maniac. Someone needs to breakup this scam. Please beware. I am thankful that this situation did not end up more seriously.
Sorry that this is not a proper review but this needs to reach all those who may be attending this must see attraction."
"This was our FIRST stop after arriving the day before at the airport. Our experience was mixed. On one side. We were still wearing our clothes we travelled across the UK in and flew in as our bags had NOT arrived with us (Picture 43 degree heat in jeans that were now 3 days old, and a not being able to put clean undies on!).

HOWEVER. This was still a great start and a good culture shock for us to experience and manage the rest of our trip. We left Dongsi Metro at 9am jumped off at Tian'amenn East metro station. It was busy, but no real queues. more of a slow shuffle into the famous outer gates with Chairmen Mao graceful staring down at you.

The actual ""ticket buying"" process was confusing. We knew that tickets needed to be purchased but weren't sure which ones, as there are MANY areas to visit that require separate ticketing. Here is what we did. Walk PAST all the chinese tourists queuing. it looks like this would be the ticket office areas. BUT NO! You will walk further through multiple gates until you're nearing an area with an out of place basketball court on the grass to you right. Then you'll see a huge gate with the a ticket office either side of you. It doesn't matter which one you go to, they're both the same.

The ""Palace Museum"" ticket was 120RMB and was everything we needed.

As for the palace itself. It big. Very big. Bigger than any British imperial attraction i've ever visited, exposed us to the sheer vastness of Chinese tourist locations! The audio guides were 10RMB each and were great help in explaining design etc, automatic location tech too. Very fancy.

You enter in the south, exit in the north. We were shattered so got a 20RMB Shaw around the palace back to Tian'anmen station."
"We travelled by subway to the forbidden city in Peak Hour so that was an experience I found it fine, although people thought me strange to be laughing about it. The Chinese inability to queue and their culture of just pushing your way through spoils this major attraction, If there were a queuing system in the building which allowed you to file through and look at them it would be great, after having to push and elbow you way to the first few doors you give up trying to see the main buildings, paying the extra to see the Treasure museum was great and it wasn't as crowded, but would it hurt to clean the glass cases so you could see the items displayed. Even with the drawbacks the majesty of the place cannot be denied and you still just have to see it."
"Plenty other reviews on here for the Palace Museum - or Forbidden City. If you are not a museum type person, and not overly fussed by old things, then this may be a drag for you. However, when you consider the speed of development in China, and the way cities are being modernised - this is a great opportunity to see ancient Chinese rituals and lifestyle - get to it while you still can, there may not be much left to see in another generation.

Of course it is tourist heavy - possibly because it is a major tourist attraction. Of course it is crowded and there are touts, guides and beggars around. Once through the very modest queue on a Tuesday afternoon it calms down and is an enjoyable stroll through history.

The English language information boards are well translated, the place is spotless and well run, and the progression from ancient history to the end of the empire is interesting. If you don't need to see every single artefact - 3 hours is plenty. If you feel cheated if you miss a single urn - you need a whole day.

I have been before, revisited it today with first-timers and still enjoyed the trip - what do you want for £6. If in Beijing - go and see it."
"The Palace Museum (The Forbidden City) is directly across the street from Tienanmen Square. The traditional entrance to the Forbidden City complex is from the southern end, right by the picture of Mao Zedung. The Forbidden City is set out as a series of buildings/halls on the north/south axis. Each of these major buildings has a courtyard area and smaller buildings perpendicular on both the right and left sides. The ""City"" is said to contain 800 buildings and over 8,000 rooms. Even though not all of them are open to the public it will still take up a good portion of your day to view this site. The buildings are more and more impressive as you travel in this direction through the ""City"". After the last building you will find the Imperial Garden which contains very old cypress trees and plantings. Just past this you will see the fake ""mountain"". Apparently, a mountain to the north of a residence is good feng shui, however the Forbidden City does not have a mountain nearby so one was built."
"An another amazing architectural masterpiece of the Chinese dating back to the 1400. A guide is again a must for this great attraction,to be able to understand the design and the feng shui that goes with it"
"Don't bother. Really, what a waste of time. Pushy locals, very noisy. If you have seen one, you have seen them all. Terrible audio guides. Look somewhere else for sightseeing."
"Also known as ""The Forbidden City"". There are long queues for the entrance tickets so remember to start early. A lot of people Takes a lot of walking but every section you enter is magnificent ! Well maintained and restored it is literally a city. You enter from the main entrance next to Tianamen Square and exit at the other end facing Jingshan Park. Visiting Jingshan park after this is a great relief form the crowd and all the walking. I would recommend you read up a bit on the history and the Forbidden city so you can relate to the sights you see !
Private guide - probably not necessary, the audio guide - good option but it can be noisy inside , so I suggest you rather read/bring a book to accompany your exploration."
"This place is enormous. And crowded. Make sure to allocate enough time, & preferably do it first thing. Also be sure to wander off to the sides, & visit the various exhibitions - ceramics, stone drums, jade etc. (make sure your ticket covers these as well as main entry). If you have a private guide, discuss what you want to see with your guide before going, as many tours only cover the main pavilions up through the centre, which after a while can get very wearisome due to the huge crowds - & it was not very busy when we were there! The gardens & halls off to the sides are very peaceful - not many people seem to venture there, but the exhibitions are very interesting.

Although it seems to make sense to visit Tian'anmen Square before crossing the road to the Forbidden City, do it afterwards or preferably on another day. It is worth it to get to the Forbidden City before the big tour groups, which will eventually drive you mad.

After the Forbidden City, cross the road to Jing Shan Park. It is very cool, quiet & peaceful, & you can have a rest while you watch people dancing, exercising & playing with Chinese yo-yos. Once revived, you can find the spot where the last Ming Emperor, Chongzhen, hanged himself in 1644, & then climb the hill to the Wanchun Pavilion for the geographical centre of Beijing, & spectacular views over the Forbidden City & Beijing generally.

Note that entry to the Forbidden City is through the South Gate only (some guides recommend the North Gate as being less crowded, but it is no longer possible), & beware of rickshaw drivers offering to take you from the North to the South - we were persuaded by the quote from one who then wanted to split my husband & I up (we didn't) & then drove us into the hutong to the East, let us off in a quiet spot in the middle & then tried to charge us over A$100 for a 10 min trip. Luckily we'd been in Beijing for nearly a week by then & had a good idea where we were, so just handed over a much smaller sum (still more than he'd quoted) & took off."
"in the olden day this was called the forbidden city and this is what i am reviewing. I was there in 1979 just after the end of the Cultural Revolution.. i thought that since then it would have been spruced up a bit as it is such a historical treasure. If anything i found it more dusty than then. It was a real stampede in the Hall of Great Harmony to take a picture inside and this was in low season.. not on a national holiday week.. so it was getting to be a bit distressing and it may distort this review. Please keep in mind.

it is still an extraordinary complex of monuments getting back to the 15th century. I would suggest to visit the museum of the clocks on one of the side alleys. As well as the many rooms on the west side of the fourth courtyard starting from the first gate (the one with Mao on top) . there are some very beautiful porcelain."
"I went thinking that the area would be better taken care of and in better shape...millions of visitors have degraded the place pretty badly. Crowds even during the week were overwhelming. In the different 'halls' it is very difficult to see anything due to the lack of lighting in these areas...and on a typical Beijing 'foggy' day, its like staring into a black hole. Overall I think its a bit overrated, but I'm glad I went. The audio guides are a must if you do go."
"I want to warn all tripadvisor members about the rickshaw drivers who prey on tourists outside the exit to the Palace Museum (Forbidden City). Many taxi drivers will drop you off near the north side, which is the exit instead of the entrance. Almost as soon as I was dropped off there (with a friend), we were convinced to take a rickshaw to the other side (the actual entrance - a very long walk around the block from the exit), at a supposed price of 3 yuan (about USD 50 cents). Halfway along the journey, another rickshaw met us, and my friend was told to move and sit on that one. We were then dropped off in an alley and demanded to pay 300 yuan (US$ 50). The same thing happened to two other colleagues who arrived separately on the same day. Neither of us paid the amount demanded, but we did pay more than we should have while also being physically threatened and pushed around before we were able to slip away into a nearby shop.

The best way to avoid this is to ensure that you are dropped off at (or as close as possible to) the Meridian Gate, which is the south (and only) entrance to the Museum. You may end up taking a small official open shuttle bus, which is legitimate and charges only 2 yuan (but is NOT a rickshaw). In general, I would recommend against riding any of the rickshaws - at least those near the Palace Museum - because the drivers are at best dishonest and at worst present a risk to your physical safety and general sense of wellbeing in an otherwise safe and well ordered city.

Obviously this is not a full review of the Palace Museum, which we eventually did enjoy, with the help of a wonderful guide (a young lady named ""Vanilla"") who we found outside the Meridian Gate (yes, the rickshaw experience did not make us totally distrustful of enterprising Chinese people). One more tip: See ""The Last Emperor"" before you go! Or if not, be planned to watch it right after your visit."
"No trip to Beijing is complete without a visit to the Palace Museum and Forbidden City. Just be prepared for big crowds and a lot of walking. There is more to explore here than the obvious main buildings, so part of the fun is getting ""lost"" in the area. A good guide book or hired guide will help you understand what you are seeing and what it was like to live here, as part of the royal family, the court, a visitor, and even the concubines and eunuchs. Allow at least two to three hours...more time, if you have it.."
"I was so excited about visiting this place but it was a total let down!!! There are huge , huge courtyards and courtyards and courtyards and halls and halls all closed ,so cant go inside ....and same looking buildings with same paintings in same colours !!!! All named Harmony and something.......They are not open at all but closed...the ones which are open are so dark inside and you have to push n shove to get a peek inside ...Too much crowd !!!. Once you enter the only way out is exit at other end and man you do 10,000 steps just from entry to exit. Avoidable"
"Everything has been said that can be said about this. The Forbidden City is a must if you travel to Beijing. If you have only one day, then spend it on this. It is so much larger than you would think it is. It will take at least half a day. The only problem is too many tourists. During the main season, it is very crowded. Also you can not see the exhibits closely because the entries are all blocked, e.g. by glass. A rainy day does not necessarily spoil your visit!"
"Impressive scale of the palace makes it a tiring visit but worth it because of the history. Make it a day trip by starting with a walk around Tian'Anmen square, through the Forbidden City (aka Palace Museum) and finish with a short walk up the hill in Jingshan Park which lies right opposite the exit of the Palace for a view over the entire Palace (and city)."
"The most exotic thing about this place is the name - the Forbidden City. It makes you want to go there. There are an enormous number of gates, or buildings, that are very similar to each other. But at the very end, there is a charming and very interesting garden that is worth the long walk. I thought there would be more artifacts than we saw. Maybe we missed them, as we didn't have a guide. Very crowded and noisy, though, especially with so many Chinese tour groups with guides that were shouting into microphones. A great place for people watching, though."
"Another must-see in Beijing!

The fastest way to get here is alight at TianAnMen East Station (天安门东站). There is only one direction of travelling; enter from the South and walk towards the North. I spent about 2 hours walking in the Forbidden City. Even though I may have watched some Hong Kong dramas showing such structures in palace, it still looks massive and fantastic to me. The buildings and vast space makes this place even more majestic. I got myself an audio guide which tells me more about the various halls as i stroll and take photos. The stories in the audio guide makes the walk more interesting because you will know the story behind each hall, room or the Imperial Garden.

As this is a popular tourist destination (even for the Chinese from other parts of China), it tends to get extremely crowded and you will end up taking pictures with people walking right into your photographs. My not-so-good encounters was having some other people cutting the ""queue"" when i was about to take picture when my turn came, or people who obviously saw me raising my camera to take a quick photo and they just continue to block my view and stare at my camera :(

But no matter what, it should not deter you from paying a visit to this beautiful place. Hope my photos attached do justice to this great attraction."
"Known to all as the Forbidden City, rather than the Palace Museum, if you have limited time in central Beijing, this is the place to come. It is enormous, so come fresh, with comfortable shoes, and to appreciate it fully, do some background reading before you arrive, either a good travel guide or Anchee Min's novel 'Empress Orchid.'
There is so much to see that you could spend days here and not see all of it.
There are so many gateways to go through - you think that you have arrived at the Forbidden City proper, only to find another defensive wall and gate, all fascinating. It is like a Russian doll!
The architecture of the many palaces and halls is stupendous, the statues amazing, and the gardens surprisingly tranquil even with a lot of tourists there."
"The Forbidden City is difficult to rate as an attraction. Of course, it is a must see despite the crowds if you find yourself in Beijing. Furthermore, it is well worthwhile to educate yourself about the Forbidden City before you go, reading up on it or even watching a movie, such as the Last Emperor. Reviewing a map helps, too. Essentially, your route is generally up through the middle and many buildings are not accessible. The more public audience halls are at the beginning and the private living areas are near the end of the tour. The scale of the place is enormous but unfortunately virtually all of the palace treasures and furniture were evacuated during various wars and they have not been returned, leaving the buildings empty. This was a disappointment. At the same time, facts, such as the courtyards being made with nine layers of bricks at different angles to prevent tunnelling in and assassination attempts, and a recounting of the emperors' sleeping arrangements are very interesting. We visited on a bright and sunny day. It would exceptionally cool to visit in a heavy rain when all the dragon downspouts are gushing, making the palace plazas look like giant fountains."
"The experience of actually being immersed in such a culture rich place was almost overwhelming. A dream long in the making.

The lines move quickly so don't be discouraged when you first see the line coming out on the sidewalk. Also expect to spend 4 hours or more exploring. We went when we were already tired and the depth of the Museum was amazing. We never got to the end so we missed some.

When you get int he middle, just use your imagination to go back in time. The experience brought tears to my eyes which at first concerned my Chinese friend. She thought I was sad, but finally just decided that I was strange. (in a good way, of course)

Showing emotions must not be something they see a lot. :-)"
We thoroughly enjoyed seeing the forbidden city with its full rich history and place in the history of the world. Its a great place to go and imagine what life would have been like when the emperor was still in power and the palace was fully optional. We went to the palace for a short 2 to 3 hours but we would love to go back and spend a whole day exploring all the things that are available there. We would recommend the Forbidden City to all who travel to Beijing it is amazing just to be within its walls.
The Forbidden City is vast so do plan on spending more than 2-3 hours here. Prepare yourself to be impressed by the imperial architecture of the former Imperial rulers of China. Please be advised there is a lot of walking and many stairs-I think there may be some accessible areas but they are not apparent. I would consult the Palace web site to see how accessible it is for people with mobility issues. The palace is like opening a big gift with another inside and then another and another. Take your camera for unforgettable and wonderful pictures of a place previously unseen by ordinary people. The colours are gorgeous. The Palace has been and is still being meticulously restored.
"To me this was fascinating & sad at the same time. Such history, and yet, showing signs of neglect & decay. It must be difficult to maintain - given the crowds. However, more attention to dusting & just maintenance is sorely needed. It's well worth a visit. I hope some attention is given quickly in order to restore/preserve this wonderful place."
"This is an iconic destination of which many people were made aware of by the movie ""The Last Emperor"". But even the movie does not prepare you for its sheer size. I went through this attraction with a tour guide, which you may find necessary as there is little labeling of exhibits. However, even if you choose to walk casually through just taking in the ambiance, you will find a visit well worthwhile."
"You could visit dozens of times and always find something new - it's so big. If traveling by taxi, insist that you get dropped off near the south end of the complex (north end of Tiananmen Square) - you cannot enter by the north gate and drivers know this and try to get extra money, sometimes. Just be aware that vehicles cannot stop on Tiananmen Square so you will have a short walk.
Don't miss the hall on the east side that houses the clock museum. After you are done and exit via the north gate, try to see Jingan Park for the fantastic views.
Best avoided on Chinese holidays unless you really like huge crowds. Arrive early, when the museum opens and before the huge crowds."
A must if visiting Beijing. I'd highly recommend a visit to the treasure gallery as it is a little quiter than the main parts of the palace and also hasn't been renovated yet so it looks a lot more rustic and authentic.
"Of course Imperial palace is a must see in Bejing. The grounds are huge and impressive, however the so called museum has very restricted access - you can barely see artifacts inside.
Also the price 60 yuan for just the access to the grounds without acess to seperate special museums seemed a bit too high.

However there are a few parts that have separate entrance and have more authentic feel, are less crowded and far more interesting. Just to the right of the main entrance with Mao's portrait, there is another entrance to the grounds, when entering there and going to the east you can find a beautiful huge pavilion were local wedding photogrpahers make Chinese wedding pictures on the weekends. It is very beautiful and really impressive. The entrance fee there is just 2 yuan. It is much less crowded. I would call this a forgotten part of the forbidden city

Also another beautiful place that you can come across when you go all the way through the main gates and to the end after exiting Imperial palace there will be a buddhist temple on the mountain. It is well worth climbing the mountain to get the view of the Forbidden city and Beijing from above."
"... and it's BIG; it's a must see for Beijing guests, although for a good visit it really does take some prep before going. If you're on your own and don't have a guide you might risk being a little overwhelmed by the sheer size of the area and the number of unofficial local guides offering their services. Be nice to them, they're also just trying to make a small living and a phrase or two of Chinese practices before your trip saying no thanks might come in handy. They will leave you alone, so don't worry... Inside the city you will have all seen in 'the last emperor' (might be a good idea to watch it before going, no?) but relatively little detailed written explanations - either do hire a good knowledgeable guide beforehand or buy a travel guide. Without these, the visit will only be worth half.

Make sure you plan enough time and do go for a stroll around the neighbourhood immediately east of the palace moat with it's tiny roads and 'genuine old Beijing'. Don't worry, you won't get robbed, molested or anything the like ... in short you're safe and people are (still) wonderful ... do come early to avoid the crowds."
We found that generally there are not many signs to assist foreign tourists and this site proved to be the same. Once again because we went during the Chinese holiday week it was extremely crowded which meant that it was not possible to really take in the surroundings. It is very popular with Chinese tourists so as a result it gets very busy. It is well worth the visit.
Well worth the visit. I enjoyed every minute. I was fortunate in that it was not too busy and the weather was perfect! I found the gardens fascinating especially the rock formations and the very old trees. It was very inexpensive for such an interesting pace with so much to see and enjoy.
"Although very crowded (everywhere in Beijing), this is a must visit place. The storytellers (tour guide) would be necessary if you really want to get the best of it. Overall, the place could be better if fully decorated with whatever left from the early dynasty. However, for architects, engineering, historians, this is a great place to study while it serves tourist the imagination of what an empire just 100 years ago."
"We still think of this as The Forbidden City, and it is a must-see in Beijing! You won't be disappointed I can assure you!
Your first impression is from Tiananmen Square and it dominates this largest of squares from the outset!
Once you're inside you're taken in by the sheer scale of the place - it's immense!
Area follows enclosed area with beautifully decorated pagodas and buildings in each one.
You can't access the majority of these pagodas but you can see into many.
It's when you realise there are hundreds upon hundreds of rooms, that housed thousands of people, that one realises it's truly a city within a city!
Yes, it's very busy but as most of the tourists are Chinese you don't mind that - it simply adds to the atmosphere and character of the place!
Absolutely amazing place, and this was my second time there and I'll go back!"
For anyone who is interested in history and the arts this is a must see place. I was fortunate enough to visit the Palace Museum with a well informed guide who explained in detail about the museum.When visiting such places I would any tourist to engage the services of a Local Guide.
"Going to Beijing and not visiting the Forbidden City is like going to London and not seeing Big Ben. Very interesting history and architecture, wonderful photo opportunities.

The treasures of the previous tenants are impressive - gold and pearl cup and saucer anyone?

However, I feel it lacks the charm of the Temple of Heaven or and Summer Palace. Visit and enjoy if you feel you must, but the other two have enough history too."
"I would recommend getting the audio guide, and give yourself time to really explore. There is so much to see here that getting in and out in an hour or two would not do it justice."
"Over-rated although it is one of the ""must-see"" sights in Beijing. Unfortunately, the authorities now make it a one-way traffic - you must enter from the south gate and depart via the north gate. You used to be able to beat the crowd by walking from the north to south which will then lead you to Tiananmen Squarre.

Most of the palace are refurbished but the scale remains awesome. My advice - seeing the hardware (buildings and architecture) in Beijing is only half the story. To complete the Forbidden City experience, you need to see the software (treasures, artifacts, paintings) in Taipei."
"get off the crowd, read some history and then stroll the side lanes. u will be rewarded with more than the regular crowd who stays on the main lanes and breeze thru without appreciating the history of this great place."
Make sure you have a good tour guide and decide beforehand how long you would like to spend there and what highlghts are on your must see list. This place is huge and the history just oozes out everywhere you look. Very interesting for young and old. A must see for any visitor to Beijing.
"The Forbidden City is fantastic and a must see, spare a whole day and a whole bag of money.
Now a days you need to pay several entrance fees to see all areas, it did use to be one entrance fee but that is long gone.
Water inside is expensive but dirt cheap inside so stock up before entering the place.
Be early or late to be able to take some amazing photos.
If alone it is a great idea to rent the audio guide but in a group, purchase a map at the ticket counter (don't buy it from the cheating hawkers) and read on the signs.
The tour guides are annoying to me at least and I prefer to explore the forbidden city myself or as this time we just used the map.
The food at the cantines is pretty awful but it goes down...better bring a snack or accept the fact that it is bad."
"More commonly known at the Forbidden Palace or the Imperial Palace. Expect to be one of thousands of people visiting on any given day. It's worse at weekends and during national holidays - when I travelled. Unlike the Summer Palace though, the entrance process was a joy.

What they don't tell you in the Lonely Planet:

Access to the Forbidden City: get out at Tiananman West metro stop and walk east in the direction of Tiananmen Square. Just before you get to the Chairman Mao portrait there is a entrance way on your left. This is actually the entrance to Zhongshan Park , but you have to go this way to actually get to the Forbidden City ticket office. There is no signage in English, which was annoying. When you get into Zhongshan Park, head to your right - going east and follow the path - it will eventually lead you to an enormous square and the Meridian Gate.

You will see one sign in English pointing to the direction of the ticket office. Despite the crowds it was well organised with people waiting in line patiently. Then make your way to the Meridian Gate.

I would recommend getting an audio guide (40rmb pp). You won't have a clue what you're looking at otherwise.

The Forbidden City is just enormous and very very impressive. Get a map - you'll need it. The architecture is beautiful and they are renovating all the time, particularly the eastern section.

It's a series of beautifully planned squares and rectangles with enormous halls and smaller buildings, processional ways, gates and bridges. This is the finest example of painted and carved wooden built architecture in the world with marble processional ways and staircases. Unfortunately you can't go into any of the main Halls or Gates. You can just about peek in if you can get past the crowds of people with their cameras in the air trying to photograph the interiors.

The east and west sides are the residential palaces, smaller buildings aligned in squares with a central courtyard, many of them now housing exhibitions. You'll pay an additional fee to see the East Side, and the Hall of Clocks and its other buildings. If you're not into clocks it's not that interesting, but the interiors alone with their carved and painting ceilings make it a must see.

The Imperial Palace Garden is the first place you'll actually seen some nature. Its quite small actually but very beautiful. It wasn't very peaceful when I was there. Due to crowds the management had closed off many paths, forcing people in a particular direction towards the Chengguang Gate and the exit.

You can't come to Beijing without seeing the Forbidden City. One of the most beautiful and amazing attractions in China. This is an opportunity to peak into the life of a Qing and Ming dynasty emperor, to walk the paths they trod and imagine their ceremonies and rituals.

What I will say though is that the Forbidden City is full of squares, halls and buildings which are essentially more of the same over and over again. The buildings are all in the same style, rectangular with the same colour and design roof, the same painted interiors etc. This does not take away from how impressive they are, for they are incredible. Traditional Chinese design and architecture is so often about symmetry and that is what makes the Forbidden Palace so impressive and beautiful. It is that elegance on a truly enormous scale which is special to see.

Allow a full day - more than 4 hours.

PS bathroom facilities are unpleasant but there are plenty of them and expect to queue a long time if you're a lady!"
"One of the main landmarks of Beijing and China.
Take the whole day to visit the place. There are many sections to visit and possibly hundreds of people visiting at the same time. Avoid visiting on weekends, as this is a popular destination for locals as well."
"The Forbidden City is a fascinating place to visit from a historical and architectural perspective and best visited with an open mind and lots of patience.
It's a place to reflect and have a glimpse of Imperial China, grateful the buildings are still around today for us to visit despite the crowd and the noise many complained about.

I arrived there just before the ticket booths were open, hired the audio equipment which I found very useful and wandered at my own pace. You no longer have to surrender your passport (as one did previously when audio cassettes were used).
Before you depart from any gates the GPS will detect your presence sending loud signals back to the hut, thus waking up the guards from their slumber.

I was hoping to see some of the renovated buildings but they were still closed to the public, which was disappointing. I do find a slight improvement in the management of the buildings - some effort being made to wipe the layers of dust! Just an observation.

There was a special exhibition of Chinese ceramics which was very interesting. It was tucked away in a building which I stumbled upon by chance."
"We visited the forbidden city in september and the crowds where very big. It was starting to get a bit frustrating when the rain started immediately the tour groups headed for shelter leaving us with our rain jackets on to wander about with moments when you almost thought you were there alone.
The crowds are big as you would expect but if you walk round the parameter of the courtyard rather than through the centre you can get peace to take in this spectacular palace complex."
"Fortunately we had allowed a full day to visit here, and to truly appreciate all there is to see, you'll need at least 4-5 hours.
Once you enter, there are temples and buildings as far as you can see.
There are bridges over waterways, huge courtyards, impressive steps and levels approaching several of the buildings, great statues, artifacts and features I hadn't seen elsewhere, and beautiful gardens at the end.
The only negative were the several smaller buildings which were closed off except for a couple of doorways. You couldn't enter, and had to fight for a viewing/camera position amongst hordes of other visitors wanting to see the features inside the building.
Other than that, we had a wonderful day here, and strongly recommend the Forbidden City / Palace Museum."
"In the middle of the Modern city of Beijing , you have an ancient city / palace ........ better known as Forbidden city

The Forbidden City was the Chinese imperial palace from the Ming Dynasty to the end of the Qing Dynasty. It is located in the centre of Beijing, China, and now houses the Palace Museum. For almost 500 years, it served as the home of emperors and their households, as well as the ceremonial and political center of Chinese government.

Built in 1406 to 1420, the complex consists of 980 buildings and covers 720,000 m2 (7,800,000 sq ft). The palace complex exemplifies traditional Chinese palatial architecture, and has influenced cultural and architectural developments in East Asia and elsewhere.
The entry ticket for the palace museum is 60 RMB"
"You can't simply come to Beijing and NOT visit the Forbidden City - it's crowded, requires alot of walking - but mightly impressive. Either arrive early or visit in the winter to avoid the crowds."
"We were disappointed we could not enter any of the buildings. The crowds were horrendous, lots of pushing and shoving. We found the buildings in poor repair. We bought an audio tour which was informative but not up to the standards of UK tours in historic buildings. We had been really looking forward to this as well but it was a real letdown. We aso found buying tickets confusing as we did not realise the name change to Palace Museum."
"Went there on a very hot day in September so make sure you have some fluids as there is quite a bit of walking involved, our tour guide informed us that it is between 3-4km long. It was better having a guide as she could explain the history of the Palace. It was extremely busy with many tourist. It is definitely recommended if you want to explore some of the history but it does involve a little climbing of stairs and walking. The garden of the Emperor is made of some stone carvings and is a nice place to cool down a bit, take some pics. Good experience even though the sun was rather hot"
"We arrived shortly after opening, although there were crowds of tour groups we didn't have any queuing for tickets. As most of the tour groups were following a central route through the site, we ventured away from the crowds and found we had the place to ourselves at times. I had my guide book and bought a map which helped guide us through. We did the busier areas before leaving and they were busy but not as bad as when we first entered the site. Thoroughly enjoyed our visit and would recommend if you are in Beijing."
"No matter what, you cannot say you experienced Beijing without seeing the Imperial Palace (i.e. Forbidden City). It is trully amazing to walk around this place as it is so huge. My wife and I visited early in the morning but we still couldn't beat the busy crowds. Because this is one of the must-sees in Beijing you will be fighting the many people who will also be there.

And because of the crowds it can be quite noisy so I don't recommend renting those audio guides. Instead I would print off guides from online and follow along that way."
I usually walk around touristy places very quickly; I entered Forbidden City at 9 am and left at 2 PM. It's really impressive.
Such beauty. Definitely a site to see! It is so much larger than ever imagined. We went at a perfect time and there were very few people. Must see for anyone in Beijing!
"This place is huge. Gives you a good overview of how self serving the dynasties were, and how paranoid. Get a guide or headphones with narration. It's so big you'll miss a lot if you don't have someone who knows what's what.
Also, we went on Monday and they close at noon or 12:30 on Mon., so we were rushed out. This takes at least 3 hours to cover."
"We were at Forbidden City in the dead heat of summer, which isn't advised since there are little opportunities for air conditioning once inside the walls. It is a lovely, impressive museum preserved of the Ming Dynasty. As non-Chinese speakers, we were not able to understand much of the displays, however, some signs were in English. We came into this site after a frightening experience riding motorcycle rickshaws. The rickshaw operators offered to take us from the North Gate down to the South Gate. To save wear on our overheated bodies, we agreed. Once the four of us were seated into two rickshaws, they stopped and divided us into four separate rickshaws due to 'weight' issues (that should have clued us in as none of us have weight issues!). Now there are four drivers, who took us into back alleys that we assumed were a short cut to the Gate. There, in the middle of the alley maze, they made us get out of the rickshaws, and demanded 300 yuan per person. This scene got quite violent. It was only after my husband got a cell phone and pretended to call the police that they grabbed the 'low' 75 yuan that he had in his hand, and quickly left us. Then, we were left on our own, and we had to find our way out of the dangerous back alley maze. Just avoid these rickshaws, regardless how respectable the driver looks. They operate in gangs in most of the tourist spots in Beijing. By the way, KNOW THIS NUMBER: 110. It's the emergency number that can save your life. (911 does not work in China, but 110 is the number to call.)"
"A must sight in Beijing but very crowded and a bit repetitive in style as you walk through the grounds. We actually preferred the view we got from the park behind it (see our separate review). Queues not bad to get in, visited around midday but we were straight in."
"Despite my extensive research before my trip, I didn't realise that the Forbidden City is actually called the Imperial palace. The building is instantly recognisable but once inside, tickets were advertised for the Imperial Palace Museum. So we did have initial doubts if we were purchasing the correct tickets. Don't worry....you are.
We first went here on a Sunday morning, fairly early. After 20 mins of pushing and shoving we decided to come back another day. I would highly advise visiting early or later on a weekday and not on the weekend.
As everyone else has mentioned the buildings are stunning, numerous courtyards, some tiny, some vast with buildings to match. You could spend hours and hours in here, taking pictures and just exploring. It's an amazing pieces of Chinese history.
The two items which could have made this a slightly better attraction, was some more history on the buildings and a map! Personally I think if would have understood the complex more if I had these items."
"This is a must-visit if you are in china. This is the palace where the old emperor lives and attended to all the matters of the country in the olden days. You can see the bedroom of the emperor, where his wives and concubines stayed, where he attended to political matters. There are huge bronze pails scattered around the palace. They are actually used for fire fighting in the olden days when they did not have any hoses and stuff. Thus, these bronze pails were used to store water. Do look at the architecture of the palace as well as they are really interesting."
"An awesome piece of Chinese history. Went on a Sunday but it was over-run with people. No sense of decorum or appreciation and jostled when trying to see into some of the buildings.

Not something that you can miss, but you may want to try some of the buildings off the main tourist route (there was one on painting and caligraphy which was beautiful). In these areas you get more peace and quiet.

The best part for me was the gardens at the north - beautiful old trees which really give you a sense of the time that the palace has been in situ."
"It gets crowded, so it's better to go either early in the morning or towards close of day.

Nice touch of history..it's just fascinating that this place has so much historical value."
"I've been the Palace museum twice. And also prepare to visit there for the third time. It's awesome and very impressive after visit there each time. The precious exhibition inside the Palace Museum is a must see but you have to pay for the ticket, but it's worthy for its price."
"Simply an amazing structure that many if not most of the Chinese emperors lived in, including the Last Emperor Poo Yi. I suggest you watch the movie, the Last Emperor to get some context regarding the Chinese culture and political history involving the end of the Emperors in China.

The Forbidden City is know as the largest wooden structure on Earth. Go on a day after a rain if possible. Get ready for large crowds.

Avoid the scam of a guide and go with the audio guide. It is synced via GPS and worked great. Also, the FC is closed Monday afternoons, so go early on that day. I suggest you tour that area Tues-Fri so you have time at Tian'an Square to see Mao's Tomb and the National Museum."
"It does get very crowded, so if you want to see into each building you have to be patient or try to squeeze through the crowd, sometimes I just held my camera over everyone's head and clicked away.
The garden area out the back is very beautiful, especially after the long walk through the rest of the palace, where there is even one speck of grass."
"The Forbidden city is a must see.

The sheer size and highly detailed decorations are awe inspiring.

Unfortunately, during my visit in May 2013 the city closed at 12pm due to repairs. I was able to make it from the South-Gate and back, but felt rushed.

Consider possible repair related closures when planning."
"Pretty, but too many pushy aggressive ppl. Went alone one morning and found it overwhelmingly crowded with rude folks. Didnt care to explore over an hour, bc the crowd got annoying."
"and is Beijing's #1 tourist attraction. Entry is via the south gate only. Exit via north, west or east gates. Best to explore this huge complex on your own with a guide book, so that you can take your time and enjoy the smaller venues -- the ceramics and clock sections are worth the detours. Crowds are massive along the central axis, but the smaller side venues are almost empty. Take time to enjoy the two parks on either side of the main entry -- beautiful temples and no crowds for a fraction of the price (aka Workers cultural Palace to the east, and Zhongshan to the west)."
A very special place to understand chinese culture and history. A wonderfull contruction! A surprise on each corner! Suggest to get the audio visit on your native language. They have all languages I could imagine!
"Incredible in its size and scale, but matched by quailty and craftsmanship. A window onto a world and culture usually only experienced for many through the movies. To explore and appreciate the museum takes a good day. I had 5 hours there and that was too short to take in the external grandeur and all the smaller displays (well, in terms of the reset of the mueum) located in many of the buildings around the site. The hall of clocks is particularly impressive. Make sure you take plenty of water to drink, wear your best walking shoes on and take plenty of spare batteries for the camera. You are going to need them."
The area is too big to cover on foot. Also there was repetition of architecture from entrance to exit from north gate. So we felt very tired and boared.
"A must visit place in the tourist agenda. The palace visit gives you insight into China's history & Culture. One can know about the lifestyle of the Chinese Emperors, there architecture, planning skills. The entire trip takes at least 3-4 hours as the site is quite big."
"go there early in the morning after a big breakfast.

you have to walk till evening.

there audio guide with 32 language
English, Farsi (Persian), Turkish, German, French and ...

have money with yourself, there is no POS inside.

there is an ATM inside but you have to walk 20 minute to reach it and comeback from south gate."
"You won't believe the scale and beauty of this wonder of the world. It is a must see for the architecture, sculpture, rooms, paintings and overall excess that some five emperors used to call ""home"". Plan to spend about 1/2 day visiting this impressive series of buildings and the courtyard surrounding."
"The Forbidden City is one of the places not to be missed in Beijing. But the city is quite an empty shell without its stories. Book a guide or rent an automatic one to make the most of this experience. (You may be surprised to find automatic guides also in not so popular languages: Arabic, Bangladeshi, Bulgarian, Cantonese, Dutch, English, Farsi, French, German, Indonesian, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Mandarin, Mongolian, Myanmarese, Polish, Portuguese, Romanian, Russian, Spanish, Thai, Vietnamese)

Get some comfortable shoes as it will be a long walk."
"You should nit leave the city without visiting. If possible do not go on weekends as there are many locals visiting and it can become quite crouded. The visit can take about 3 hours if you take the headphones, if you want to shorten it just scape some of the buidings but it's really worth visiting"
"It kind of perplexes me how this isn't in the top 3 places to go in Beijing. If you go to Tian An men square then you'll have to go to the Palace Museum/Forbidden City.

The plan here is to try to get here earlier or you'll be run over by millions of other tourist pushing to take pictures.

So plan to be outside waiting at 830 am so you can get a good opportunity to get some good photos in.

There are 3 main sections to the Forbidden city. The section on the left, the middle and the right.
The right side contains mostly stuff you have to pay extra to see like the clock museum, the stone museum the Chinese theater place and the nine dragon wall.

The left side contains mostly the housing of the emperors many wives. Each wife or family member had their own little courtyard which is interesting to look at.

In the middle is the main structures that are magnificent to see.

In the back is the emperors personal garden.

If you want to see everything you might want to just start from the right then go to the middle and the left.

The reason being is the attractions on the right usually close earlier than the forbidden city itself usually around 4 pm. Then the middle because that's where most of the important stuff is and then the left which is nice to see but not really necessary.

Summary-
Go there early!!!!
Make sure to study the map well online so you can plan your day accordingly
Bathrooms have squatters and normal ones
60 rmb to get in for the tourist season and 40 rmb offseason
15-20 rmb extra to go see the different museums inside the palace museum
Easy to find by taking the subway it's impossible to take a cab
You can also take an electronic rickshaw there from the north entrance"
"Being in Beijing and not doing Tiananmen Square/Forbidden City would be like being in Orlando and not doing Disneyworld. So just get on with it. Its worth a half day or more. Crowds are oppressive though. Try to visualize the place as it once was.

We hired a tour-guide to walk us through. I thought it was worth it and she turned out to be a lovely person who we throughly enjoyed and were sorry to say goodbye to.

Just walk through Tiananmen Square for a few minutes and you will be approached by local tour guides offering you their services. If the first one doesn't feel right, politely say no and another one will find you soon enough. Americans are super easy for locals to spot because we tend to carry water bottles where ever we go and wear clothes that look like billboards."
"Reserve full day for seeing it. Some advice:
- There is lots of scammers around the forbidden city (99% of them are girls) that will pretend to be tourists or students learning English and will want to invite you for a coffee or beer to chat with you. But if you agree you will end up paying fortune for it. I had known about it before the travel, but I was still surprised how many scammers like these I met there.
- Go to the top of the hill north of the forbidden city: the view is incredible, especially just before the sunset."
"Having read books about the history of China, Dowager Empress Cixi, and books by Anchee Min, the Forbidden City was on my list of “must sees” in Beijing. It didn’t disappoint. While I had read about its historical significance, massive size, and architecture, I was absolutely mesmerized and stunned when I first saw it – the experience was so much more impressive than I would ever have imagined. Picturing the royal families, and all who lived there, as well as their experiences – much of which I had read about – made their history really resonate and come alive for me. It was easy to picture the golden bricks in the hallways, the gardens, the birds, the people bustling through this walled city. Make sure and use a tour guide – with 9,000 rooms, almost 1000 buildings, and 1,600,000 square feet – it is beneficial just to have someone help you navigate not only the Forbidden City itself, but help you make your way through the throngs of tourists who will be visiting. However, more importantly, the history of the Forbidden City is fascinating and the guides are quite informative about its ancient history, halls, palaces, collections, and symbolism. Visiting the Forbidden City is a fascinating experience and provides a foundation for understanding the history of China."
Even full of (mainly local) tourists it's still possibl to find little corners with no one in them... The whole area is huge und really seems to come right out of the movie with palaces one right after the other. The walking order in the Lonely Planet guide is actually a great way of experiencing the place. Don't miss climbing up the hill in the park behind the North Gate for a fabulous view!
"We visited on a summer sunday. It was so crowded, mostly with local Chinese, that we could hardly move. Fortunately there are numerous seats were we could sit, recover and people watch. We thought there was a sameness about the courtyards and outside of the buildings and the crowds made more detailled indoor visits almost impossible. Do not go at weekends or in the summer heat."
"Before one can go to the palace museum one has to pay 60rmb entry fees to the forbidden city which is pretty decent in view of the scale and size of the forbidden city. However we were apporached by ticket touts to buy tickets from them as the queer to buy tickets for entry is pretty long and the weather is very hot during our visit in end August.

We went to the clock museum entry fee is 10 rmb and were awed by many exhibits of various types of clocks on display. It would take at least an hour to admire all the exhibits on display.

The palace museum is also worth a visit where there are many artifacts on display.Again the entry fee is only 10 rmb. Many of the artifacts are pretty huge and priceless like the various huge jades given to the emperor on his birthdays etc.There are also many artifacts and jewelleries that are worn by the royalties on display. To really appreciate all the articles on display one would require at least one to one half hour to view all the items."
"the palace is absolutely amazing, one should go to the actual palace nd not only the museum. Discovering the history of the place, the emperor nd his family and the history is awesome nd mind blowing. A must see"
"The Forbidden City is huge. We were there in August which is also the Chinese summer holidays. The place was so crowded (mainly Chinese). We walked around the place for hours, There is so much to see. However because of the crowds, it was difficult to visit the smaller museums inside the complex... Overall I would say visit this sight but if you are limited for time, then go to the summer palace instead which was much more beautiful and impressive!"
"It was hot and the place was crowded!! I have no doubt that the place is beautiful but we didn't see much at all. Please do not let this comment put you off because the place was recommended to us by a friend who spends at least three hours every time she visits the place. May be the day was not right for us. We looked around some, took few pictures and left. All we did was walk, and our walk was toward finding the exit. What we enjoyed more was walking up to the pavilion (Jingshan Park) that is located opposite to the palace."
"When you go to Forbidden City, dont forget to come to Palace Museum (you need to buy ticket again 10Y). This place close earlier than another building in Forbidden City, so if you dont have much time to spend, i suggest to visit this place first then visit another area. U can go to forbidden city by subway line 1 and get down in Tian An Men East. Go to exit A."
"The scenery is beautiful, but I found this place to be a bit overrated. Many places just look the same so once you've seen one, you don't really need to go everywhere. When there were glasses covering some rooms, they were so filthy you could hardly see what was inside. As for the interior rooms, the smell was just disgusting inside and kept us from going in. The imperial garden was worth the view. Most important of all, don't go there on a hot day: many visitors seem to completely forget that personal hygiene is not only a matter of respect for yourself, but also a matter of respect for others when you go out in public. If you thought it smells bad in China, you're in for a reallty unpleasant visit if you go there in the summer."
"This museum is very large and very beautifully restored, as there are many steps up to each pavilion or Temple, and there are no lifts, escalators or ramps it would be very difficult for a person with any physical disability to view most of the artifacts. The garden area was beautiful and serene, even though there were lots of people walking around, taking photos etc. and the children were very well behaved.

My only disappointment was that the ""Ladies"" Room had a ""AAAAA"" rating for cleanliness from the Chinese/Beijing tourist bureau and I must say it was the dirtiest one I went to in the 3 weeks I was in China. I know it was the first Sunday of the school holidays, and there were a lot of people, but the place was not inundated with tourists, it was about 12 noon, and the ""cleaning ladies"" were standing near the entrance chatting. I have not moved so fast for a long time and when I came out my daughter asked if I had seen a ghost."
We went with 2 young children and we had greatly underestimated the size. The buildings are impressive and the scale is astonishing when compared to European palaces. The clock room is not just a wonderful detour but also the only place that reasonable air-conditioning. The place is crowded with local tourists and expect mainly asking you to take pictures of your children along with theirs.
"Likes:-

1) Having Chinese roots, I have been to the Forbidden City / Palace Museum once in this lifetime.

Dislikes

1) It is overcrowded with local tourist.
2) What Palace Museum??? With whatever miserable artifacts available on display, it should not even be called a museum.
3) Want to see how an actual quarters look like within the Forbidden City, dream on.... it has all been converted to mini galleries that houses vases etc.
4) Want to see the throne rooms? Beijing tourism authorities have no cow sense, they only open 2 small doors and hundreds,/ thousands will flock/shove their way at this doors with their cameras trying to catch a glimpse of what is inside which is badly lighten up. Shame on you whoever is in charge of the Palace Museum."
"I guess crowds are only to be expected in Beijing. At least the queues for the toilets were not long. Overall the facilities are excellent in this attraction. Good shoes, plenty of water, hat and patience are required. It was so much bigger than I expected and so beautifully ornate. I purchased a book which has photos of the bits you cannot see. I imagine if they allowed the public into many of the buildings there wouldn't be a lot left. Thousands and thousands must trundle through its doors every day. So glad I saw it though. Beautiful memories and if one stops to allow the imagination to conjure up the spirits of the past an outstanding legacy to the Ming dynasty."
"Enjoyable for the courtyards and the big areas, but not overwhelming. The pieces on exposition were averaged displayed and badly illuminated. A lot of rooms were fully surrounded by dirty glass, from the visitors hands. The best museum part it's the Clock exposition, for which the ticket it's an extra 10 RMB."
"This was one of the better things to see. Better if u have a guide so one can understand what and why u r seeing the various buildings. My wife, just as a women would, asked where was all the furniture. As she viewed each building.
Within walking distance of the tenement square where the revolt took place.."
"AKA the Forbidden City because it was forbidden for anyone to enter except the emperor, and his staff. It was the imperial palace for a succession of twenty-four emperors and their dynasties during the Ming and Qing periods of Chinese history. The museum is also China's largest and most complete architectural grouping of ancient halls. Construction was begun in 1420."
"Until you visit the Palace Museum, you really don't know how ""grand"" is China. Every time I visited Palace Museum, I learned something new. The admission is a bit expensive, but I guess if they show you a history of 500-600 years, there is a premium to pay. What I don't like is that it seems always crowed even with that price...."
"We only had a day in beijing as transit flight customes , bt we decided to spend it here and we don'r reget it! The palace is amazing, huge and has lots of history. The audio tour was well worth doing asit helped us to learn about the incredible history."
"I have been to The Palace Museum three times. 1st I was 5 years old, so I didn't recall anything. Second time was in 1999, I was there with my father. The architecture was so impressive. My most recent time was in 2005, this time I was with travel agent, so a tour guide was assigned and led the whole group. I learned so much history from the tour guide. Without a tour guide, you will miss a lot. She explained the details of architecture, history, culture, which you won't know from the tourism signs. For example, there are nine ""Qilin"" on the roof, why there are nine of them, but not eight, or seven, why Qulin was picked, not dragon. So much to learn.

Strong recommended to have a tour guide with you. You will learn a lot."
"You may be used to seeing photos of the entrance to the Forbidden City. Don't be fooled, there is a full CITY inside of there. If you want to look at everything they have, be prepared to spend several days browsing. You can walk straight through in about 2 hours, though, if you don't take lots of side trips.

The crowds are horrendous, but the various vendors were very welcome for the ice cream and popsicles they sell!"
"The Forbidden City is massive and extremely crowded. As I went in August it was not only excruciatingly hot but was during the chinese school holidays so busier than normal. Even with the audio tour, I found the palace hard to navigate and found myself walking in circles a few times. It also felt repetitive, that is, many of the buildings looked similar. I did, however, like the massive copper pots used for fire fighting and that each building is ranked by importance by the number of beasts on the roof tops. Overall, the weather and the crowds were a real down point and not sure I would go again."
"Bothe the square and the forbidden city are a must if visiting Beijing. The city is much larger than I expected, but very nicely preserved and a great attraction to see."
This is a must see. Allow a day to really enjoy the surrounds and the palace. Take plenty of water if its a hot day as its a lot of walking and can be tiring.
Definitely the best museum in Beijing in my opinion. Only downside was the walking in about 40 degrees surrounded by way to many tourists. Be sure to check this place out if you like to see some chinese culture = temples and stuff.
"The forbidden city is as beautiful as you expect it to be, but with all the fun stripped out. Going in peak season is a nightmare - the queues are fine (ignore anyone trying to sell you tickets, just go with the crowd and pay at the ticket booths), you don't need a guide (the audio guide is cheaper and acceptable) - you need massive elbows and a lot of patience. It's just not enjoyable to be pushed and shoved endlessly for up to 5 hours in the baking Sun. Expect it to be pretty, just don't expect to enjoy it."
"As the largest Museum in China, it is no surprise that the Palace Museum is large in every single way."
"This is one of the must see -places when visiting Beijing. The area is massive, a lot of walking to do! Not the most beautiful places in Beijing but worth visiting. So many chinese temples and palaces, they all look quite the same. Little park at the north side of the area is nice."
"its super crowded, as expected but it was worth the visit. you need to buy separate tickets to visit the extra museum, but its all up to you. I did visit all of them and they are good"
"Would have been an excellent (very reasonable price) had it not have been so hot. That's our fault though for traveling in July. Even though its crawling with tourists the Forbidden City is huge. I'm glad the communists didn't bulldoze it because it's fall of interesting history from two dynasties. The north western corner is particularly inimate and definetley worth a look. The saving grace for us was the 4RMB ice blocks they were selling. Glad they weren't price gouging tourists though they could have been. Take a big hat, a few liters of water and sunscreen."
"The museums within are good, but the city is just one more place to walk walk walk and see the same Chinese traditional architecture, prefer to walk on the surroundings and avoid ""tea friends"""
"Arrive at 8.30 at the South entry, the North gate now is only an exit. Early there is not such a big queue? If you hold an Accrod Permit (disability Permit) the entry is free, no need to queue. Most groups and people go through the center of the Forbidden City. The right side has lots of interesting museums. Buy a map for 5 yuan, approx A$1. The sides are all to yourself and very interesting. In the center are mostly buildings that you can only see from the outside. You have to pay extra for the different museums. The jewelry museum gets pretty crowded too with locals and groups.
Allow a good half day of visit. Do not visit with a tour group as you will miss most of it, do it by yourself. I would not recommend the taped commentary, as you can read this by yourself at a later date. I asked people around and many told me that it was not worth it. If your health is fragile, beware, there are lots of steps. Enjoy!"
"Ok so it's crowded, but its history. Even if you're not into history it's fascinating to see the differences between how China used to be, and how the current populace interacts with this place. You don't need more than an hour or two to get a flavour of the palace. The people watching and crowds are part of modern day China, so entirely appropriate in this venue. My advice get there early for opening at 8:30 am and once you get in wonder through some of the alleys away from the ""important"" areas. You'll be surprised but you may actually find courtyards all to yourself, or at lest with just a few people, and then head out to explore the rest of the City before it gets too crowded and hot."
"The Forbidden City is, of course, one of the must-sees in Beijing. It is a very large complex that you really do need time to visit. I allowed about three hours, which is fine, but I still didn't see all of it.

The buildings are nice and the history interesting. There are many buildings to explore and read about - Make sure you take a good book to explain the functions of each area / building.

Having been to a lot of Asia, I must say that it wasn't as amazing as some places I have been. But, it was worth a visit, despite much of it looking the same as the last part.

Maybe combine this with a visit to Tianenmen Square, as it is of course right next to it. Overall, that makes a nice day out in Beijing."
"The Palace Museum, also known as the Forbidden City, a city within Beijing. It had been for emperors and royal families living place and office for emperors as well for about 3 danasties for more than 400 hundred years.

it does have the Wow factor. When you step in the huge red gate, you will be overwhelmed by the size and grandiosity of the palaces, temples etc... However, you will probably only can see the architechures, all the royal families treasures, paintings were moved to Taipei Palace Museum about 65 years ago.

A word of adivce, do NOT go there during weekend from 10am ~3pm. you will be swiming in the sea of people. The palace opens about 9am in the morning, but no matter it's weekday or weekends, there will be plenty of tourist groups compete with you. So my suggestion go there after 3pm during weekdays, usually you will be needing about 2~3 hours. The palace becomes quiet after 4pm, and it starts to ask people leave around 4:30pm, but you could linger a little bit longer 'til 5 or 5:30 pm... it would be totally different feeling when you have the whole palace for yourself, even just for 5 or 10 mins..."
"We paid for the museum, but I am not sure we saw it. The clock section was closed. The screen of nine dragons is reproduced all over China. Hard to figure out why this cost extra."
"There was an enourmous line to buy the ticket,no one speaks english, at the end we had to exit because of the line"
"Took us about 30 min to get tix on Sat morning. Then inside is Ren Shan Ren Hai.
I visited 30 yr ago. I could get inside to take a look. Now you can't get in and only can take a peek at the door, since it is Ren Shan Ren Hai, my husband had to squeeze\fight to get to the door to get a glance inside, my son and I even didn't try. After couple time, my husband gave up too. We were out of there in less then 2 hr."
"Tour groups from all over the world, plus many many more and bigger groups from all corners of China are here marveling and taking picures elbow to elbow with you, it's hard to imagine what it was like at all with the unbelievable level of crowd."
"In fact everything in China is amazing considering the 5,000 yr history.this was the new Palace built when the Emperor Ming wanted to move his capitol from Nanjing in the mid-late 1500's. It's spread our over numerous acres. The Forbidden City is void of any trees or Grass, It was used primarilly for official business and was divide into 2 areas the outer and inner. Because the Emperor had HUGE PARK near the enclave to relax and enjoy, The outer was used to make announcements and to grret dignitaries etc.
The ticket lines could be long but you can hire an English speaking guide and you will pay her entrancd fee and she can get the tickets for you in a short period of time.There are recorded self guide tape units that walk you through the tour. It is conveniently located across from Tianamen Square and several government buildings plus the natinal Museum. It is a must for visitors."
"During the summer holiday, our family went to The Palace Museum in Beijing.A must for Beijing! , it was extremely busy and the lineup for tickets was easily 2 hours long, and there was a sign saying the last tickets would be sold at 11:30am!! We visited the house of the emperor and his wives . We learned a lot history of Qing dynasty."
"A must for Beijing! Massive, so plan for a good amount of time. No shade, brings lots of sunscreen! We went in mid June, it was extremely busy and the lineup for tickets was easily 2 hours long, and there was a sign saying the last tickets would be sold at 11:30am!! Not sure if this is a common occurence, but it was a little surprising! We originally weren't going to do this, but we were approached by a young lady offering to be a tour guide. What got us was the fact she could get the tickets immediately - a great option if the lineup is huge and you are short on time. She was very knowledgeable and we ended up being very pleased. Tour was three hours. There are many people offering tours; we had seen many of them from her organisation around so it seemed legit. The city itself is beautiful, a definite must see!!"
"Massive yet confining

Poor emperors had no serious park space

Use your imagination to picture concubines and eunuchs by the hundreds"
"Listed amoung United Nations' world cultural heritage. Not only serves as the royal palace of chinese last two emperial dynast: Ming and Qing dynasty, but its building style has huge influence on neighbour countries' emperial palace, such as Viernam and Korea.

Now, The past royal palce server as a historical museum to tourists with thousands of rooms and hundres of thouands pieces of antiques.

Easy to reach, located in the center of beijing, by buses, subways or taxis. As its' area is so large, you can not go through it for a sigle day"
"This impressive structure dominates the centre of the city. The inner rooms, gardens and courtyards are a welcome respite from the hustle and bustle of modern day Beijing. Unfortunately, there is very little furniture left (most of it taken to Taipei after the 1949 revolution) so it is somewhat similar to Versaille."
"Everything here is very spread out - it's a huge place! You will do a lot of walking. It is very much worth the time to see as much a possible. Highlights for me were the Hall of Clocks (an extra fee) and the Garden - beautiful. Do to its proximity to Tienanmen Square, protests still occasionally take place here and nearby. During our visit, a protestor with a prosthetic leg (actually a stick with a shoe on it) had a knife to his neck and was shouting some angry words in Chinese. These words must not have been pro-government because he was carted off in short order by four policemen. There is always something going on in this very busy, very crowded part of Beijing!"
"It's what you would expect. The place is just huge, the buildings grand. However it was also packed and hot during summer."
"Be prepared for crowds at this attraction. And plan to do some walking as well. If you are a history buff this will certainly be up your alley. Lots of interesting artwork, artifacts and architecture can be found. And the place is huge! If going on a hot day take extra water. Certainly work the admission price - including the extra admission places within."
"I liked the forbidden city, the old chinese architecture is impressive. I think it's a place you must have seen in beijing. This historical place is worth to be seen. But it was soo crowded! We were there in the main holiday-season in July. It's hard to enjoy all the nice building and rooms if there are ten thousands of people walking around you. It's impossible to ""feel"" the history of this place or to think back to the time this place was an important centre of power in China. It made the impression of just being one more attraction that can generate some money..."
"We really liked the Forbidden City! It is very interesting and if you don't know much about Chinese architecture and history (like us), buy the audio guide - it is very informative and really improved our visit. The only thing that marks this attraction down: The Chinese tour groups - they are present in insane numbers during high season & weekends, and will seemingly stop at nothing to get front row views. Try to avoid them - come early. That way you will also beat the heat, which is a good thing as this is an outside and huge attraction meaning lots of sun exposure. But these huge groups are just a part of China, so try to embrace it - or simply ignore them - and enjoy the beautiful and very interesting Forbidden City. There are good reasons as to why this is a must see! :)"
"Never to be missed when in Beijing. Be prepared to walk & tons of ppl visiting each day hence better to go either v early or v late. Tickets can be purchased at the entrance, no need to book in advance."
"I visited the Forbidden City/Imperial Palace/Palace Museum as part of a tour. I appreciated the information the tour guide gave me about the architecture and history of the emperors. Without this information, walking through the palace would not have been very interesting. Everything looks the same and there is not enough information to explain what you are seeing."
"Set aside a day for the Forbidden City (Palace Museum) and you still won't see it all. Until 1948 only members of the imperial family and their invited officials could enter the grounds. It must still feel extraordinary for Chinese peoples to enter the site. Standing in front of the entrance, under a giant picture of Chairman Mao, one looks over Tiananmen Square which is over 100 acres in size. The recent and ancient history in the square and the palace is overwhelming to consider. This is a must see location in Beijing."
"On the right side of the Palace Museum, there is a clock museum. Ha, clocks, you say? These are clocks that were presented to various Emperors by foreign governments. Some of them are as big as a small room and as elaborate. I had avoided it for many years, but after visiting it once, it has become a must see! That along with gardens in the far North of the Palace Museum, don't miss them."
"The former Forbidden City was interesting and our guide was knowledgable. I cannot believe one man lived here with his family, concubines and eunuchs. Unlike Versailles that was built to house thousands of nobles in addition to the king and his family, the dignitaries stayed else where. The buildings are beautiful, the thrones are interesting and the sculptures are beautiful. The garden would have been a treat were it not for the heat and the crowds!"
I really enjoyed the history of this site. I had a personal guide so I don't know how much it cost to get in. It was very crowded but if you walk along the outside and don't just follow the crowds you can see the buildings much easier. I like how they have been repainting the detail so you can see the vibrant colors. I liked this better than the Summer Palace.
"The number 1 place to visit in Beijing by default. The place is massive. Prepare to spend at least 3 or 4 hours just to walk around. The place is easy enough to find as it is located nearby Tiananmen with 2 subway stops close by.

The entrance fee is 60 CNY and I recommend paying another 20 CNY to rent the audio tour guide thing as it comes in various languages.

One annoying aspect are the various street vendors and fake tour guides bugging you every 10 seconds.

Prepare for a lot of walking and taking a lot of pictures.

Overall the experience is positive and a must-see place in Beijing."
"We have been to Taiwan where the best treasures of the Forbidden City were taken when the Nationalists were running from the Communists. So we have seen the beautiful things that used to be there. Sadly, while this museum has a few items, none really compare with what is missing."
"we were there with just over an hour to visit. the audio aid was a great guide to go around the place. It's a pity that the place could be better maintained probably damaged during the war times and cultural revolution. For those who just want a quick look with little interest in history, an hour is enough. 3 hours for the whole place. crowd dispersing in the late afternoon so still a great time to avoid the crowd."
"You cannot help but marvel and the shear size of this place and the beauty of the magnificent buildings.
Either take a guide or audio aid to add to your experience and enjoyment.
Happy travels."
"It was interesting to visit and see the sheer size of it. The day I visited was very hot and very crowded, and it was not even a weekend day.
The garden at the end was nice to see, and the GPS audio guide was good.
You cannot exit where you enter, so it is a good idea to visit Tiananmen Square first, as where I exited was a long way from the Square.
After my visit I came across the Jingshan Park and visited it. This park gives you a fantastic view, it is man made and really worth visiting."
"Beijing is a wonderful city and is full of pristine monuments, temples and old quarters that are far more worthwhile to visit than the Forbidden City. It is unbelievably crowded and, considering it is one of China's main monuments, with UNESCO World Heritage Status, looks utterly dilapidated with lots of rotten wood and paint and weeds growing around the grounds. The walk up to the Forbidden City through Tian-anmen Gate is full of vendors selling tat while inside the Forbidden City is full of shops selling tat and hotdogs. Although it is one of the ""must-sees"", like The Colosseum or the Eiffel Tower, I really would not recommend the Forbidden City. The Summer Palace or Temple of Heaven are far more awe inspiring. Even the old hutong quarters surrounding the Forbidden City are worth more credit."
"The palace museum (formerly Forbidden City) is interesting. There are lots of extra charges (entrance fee, separate fees for different areas of the museum, fees for the gps operated guide). There are many tours that move fast through the property. If you only have one site to see, I suggest the Summer Palace instead."
"This was once called the Forbidden City but is now only referred to as the Palace Museum. Local maps only indicate Palace Museum. There is tremendous history in this place. The sheer size is awesome. If you can imagine what it once was it is very impressive. On the down side, this is the most visited palace in China. The numbers of people here are staggering. Do Not go on a weekend or Holiday. You will get far more from this if you do some reading about it before you go. For Beijings main attraction, it was not in good shape. Definitely in need of a facelift. Too much litter and garbage, a by product of too many people. As I've said in other reviews around Beijing, unless you speak the language, arrange for a guide in advance. You'll be approached by 20 people offering to be your guide for a fee. Arrange for a guide before you go through a reputible agency. I used china Odysea and was very pleased. Do NOT attempt to drive in Beijing. taxi or Private car is the only way to go. Make sure you visit the gardens off to the side of the main South entryway."
"I wen there in summer and there was crowd of people, mostly Chinese but the queue itself was not so slow. The place is huge, I was not able to see it all, I would suggest to buy the map because sometimes I had to go back and take another route to be sure to see everything. The American guy at the information desk was very nice very nice and gave me some useful hints. The many route is always packed, but on the sides there is more tranquility. Every extra I had to pay to see the clockworks and the 9 Dragons Screen were worth it. The park at the end is very nice, and when you leave there is a board with a lot of suggestions and directions about next things to visit."
"As others have said, visit the Forbidden city because it's there and for what it was. Hire an audio tour to learn some of the history (avoid the huge number of tour touts that will approach you) ... But don't expect to see anything other than a pretty bereft physical space and huge numbers of other people jostling to peer into one darkened, empty palace building after the other. Be particularly careful if you have younger kids: the crowds are really daunting for someone no more than waist-high. Wouldn't rush back but pleased we went. Also, very impressed by how many more public conveniences there are in Chinese attractions today, and how much cleaner they are than I remember during the 1980s and 90s."
"I know that the Forbidden City has a fascinating history, but when it's 95 degrees and you've been walking all day, it just seems like a bunch of buildings. The garden in the northern part of the grounds is really lovely."
"The palace museum or forbidden city was most important structure in emperor's kingdom with 10 dragons on its administrative hall; and 7-9 dragons for other halls associated with work. It has 14 gates, and countless number of rooms (This I say is because residential section on either sides is not open to public). The marble walkway in the middle is for the emperor; once for empress during wedding ceremony and once for first 3 rankers in imperial examinations. There are magnificient halls for administrative work and harmony; where emperor worked. The later half of palace museum is exact replica of front half except that there are gold plated vessels and pair of dragon-lions guarding the gates; and less important as depicted by number of dragons on the structure. It's a long walk across 14 gates."
"If your into history, the building is a feast to your eyes along with all the background stories behind it. Entering the gate alone, had left you speechless at the thought of things which had happened on this Palace ground.

If your not so much into history, the imperial garden at the back is breath taking, probably colours of flower during summer time would have make it better. But the pavilions and those old trees already do you justice.

It is definitely packed with people, and put some toll on your feet. The pathway leading to the Palace Museum front gate in particular is very disheartening. But it WORTH it all.

Ps. There are benches everywhere if you want to take a breather."
"was so crowded getting in, but the place is huge, so crowds thin out a bit. i would NOT get the audio guide if i went back. it was more distracting than helpful, and it was too hard to hear & pay attention with all the noise from the crowds (so noisy). also each place has a plaque you can read with the same basic info.

this is the #1 thing to do in beijing, it's awesome. very crowded but necessary to see :D

i paid extra to see the 9 dragon screen, i'm glad i did. although the jewelry exhibit wasn't too exciitng.

all the plazas and temples are amazing. the place is huge, it really takes a long time to see."
"The Palace Museum is within the grounds of the Forbidden City which is definitely a must see. As recently as ten years ago access to the Forbidden City was, well, forbidden :-)

It's an amazing place to visit."
"This place is so unique and incredible, I suggest putting it at the top of you Beijing list. Bring comfortable shoes, as there is a lot of walking required. We were dropped off in the square and proceeded toward the north end. It took about 2-3 hours, and was well worth it."
It goes on and on and on but while some could be seen as samey and repetitive there are lots of little gems to keep you interested. Audio guides are gps with a map on the back so wandering feels safe as it's easy to work out where you are.
"Make sure you get dropped off at the South end of the complex. Not opposite the Jingshan Park entry. Building on an epic scale! And many many red doors! If you are a history buff, get a guide but we just wandered through at our leisure and enjoyed the enormity of it all."
"Yes, the Forbidden City is representative of an interesting time in history and architecture. If you are looking to take pictures of iconic Chinese buildings then this is the place. However, the overall lack of respect and appreciation was surprising and disappointing. People throw trash on the ground and let their children use the restroom freely in the public areas. I understand that this is common in China but I thought that there would be a little more consideration when it comes to places of historical and cultural importance. For me, there are plenty of other places that are just as iconic and beautiful but are less heavily trafficked. Historically, it is interesting but much of it is restored and not original."
"Firstly, visit the Forbidden City with a guide. I went with Helen, a guide from Catherine Lu Tours. Without a guide you will wander around looking at the many buildings but with no idea of their function or history. This is a fascinating palace which a guide will bring alive. Features that you would otherwise overlook suddenly reveal the complexities of Palace life. Using this information you become more aware and easily visualise what were many centuries of Chinese history."
"It's The Palace Museum, do I need to say more. Impressive hardly describes it. If you here, then you must find time to see it. You won't be disappointed."
"Was looking forward to seeing The Forbidden City or as it's called The Palace Museum. I describe it as a huge palace with countless ""squares"". You walk in and see one empty square...then you walk across it, continue forward up the steps and down again...and there's another square. You cross that one and you see another square. After a while it all starts looking the same. But it is interesting to experience and hearing the history behind it. An immense place."
"Amazing place, interesting history and fantastic architecture.

A really enjoyable day out wandering around in here!"
"We went on a Sunday, it was so crowded, there were shoulder-to-shoulder people. We didn't go with a group so the audio tour was very worthwhile. Very beautiful, very big… take your time and enjoy it. There are several gift shops worth visiting as well"
"The Forbidden City is enormous! Even though it attracts thousands, it is so large that it doesn't feel busy once you are inside. Hire the audio guides as there is not much in the way of signage in English. Our 6 year old really enjoyed the stories (don't pause them or you miss the commentary!). Come prepared for all weather and with walking shoes. It is huge!"
"This is one of the must sees in Beijing. However there were way too many people to enjoy the site. It cost 80RMD to get in. The Palace Museum is the Forbidden City. I walked around for a bit trying to get in without a ticket because I didn't want to see the ""Museum"" but the city is the museum."
"I made a mistake and arrived too late (almost 11am after visiting TianAnMen). By then it was too hot on a sunny summer day.

There were too many people crowding the entrances of each palace trying to see or take photo of the few piece of furniture inside.

The place is so big and takes a long time walking from one place to another my friend and I gave up visiting the extra exhibition on Treasures.

The audio guide was too expensive by international standards. 40rmb for an english audio guide.

Another reason for the disappointment was because I expected more after watching all the period drama. Yes the palace was grand and forbidding, but the furniture are not there. At least create replica and put the replica inside the palace."
"I visited the Palace Museum with a tour guide, right after being somewhat disappointed with Tienanmen Square. I did not have any expectations for the Palace Museum, and was impressed with the structures, size and history. It seemed to go on forever as you enter one square after another.

It's very busy and popular attraction, particularly for large tour groups, but because of it's size it's easy to find a bit quieter areas as you go through. Just keep a look out for tour guides with flags and avoid them as that's where the groups will gather.

If you do not have a local tour guide though, it's best to get the self guide audio so you have some of the history behind the palace explained. Make sure you have good pair of shoes as you will be doing a lot of walking around."
"very easy access by subway. the place is a paying temple, so you buy a ticket to enter, but the temple is in good shape, not to big, but enougbt to see, lots of local praying there.
nice temple"
"Make sure you mentally prepared for the long walk. It is like a never ending journey from the entrance to the exit.

Every hall has its own purpose and meaning.

Make sure you read the background of this place and if unsure, ask the guide.

Be there early to beat the crowd. By the time tour groups start arriving, you will not be able to take photos. Beautiful landscape and archtecture."
"Well what else to say.. Impressive.. Massive... I havent visited all part of this palace.. I might lost hahaha, You have to go and see by yourself.."
"The Palace Museum (the official name of the Forbidden City) is a wide collection of clocks, frocks, ceramics, jewels, jade, scrolls displaying the best of Chinese art and crafts of the last thousand years. As a museum it is extremely interesting but definitely not well maintained (poor signage, very poor explanations, scant information, partial translations from chinese) and not up to modern museum standards. Architecture is probably the most striking feature and it is a must see for anyone in the world if only to get an idea of how powerful, immense and wealthy China has been for the centuries. No matter what you plan visit will take much more time than you expect. It is a huge complex, there's thousands of people around and logistics are not visitor friendly."
"We got to the Forbidden city early, after passing through Tianemen square ( a somber experience after seeing the images of the uprising years ago). Our guide, Jerry, from China Guide was awesome and gave us great details on the history and establishment of the City. We were happy to find it NOT that overcrowded (get there early) and we were rock stars to some of the Chinese visitors who had not seen white people before. The city is built on an axis that passes through it AND Tianemen square and the Drum tower near Hutong district (another must see)"
This is the highlight of Beijing. Try to have a little wander around at the North side of the palace when the towers and the entrance are lit up. Less crowds and very enjoyable. The gates and buildings inside are very impressive. Unfortunately there is not a lot to see in the buildings itself. Most of it is not accessible for the public and the ones which are open don't have a lot of furniture in it. Despite this it is definitely a most see. Just be aware off dodgy rickshaw drivers who try to rip you off after a short drive. They try to charge 300 yuan for a little ride from the north to the south gate. You can hire a car with driver for a day for this money! Just write down the amount you agree on before you take a ride to overcome any discussions.
"The Palace Museum is a great place to visit and see the history of ancient China, however, be aware that it cost additional money to visit the museum on top of the fee you pay to get into the forbidden city where the Palace Museum is located."
"I like this historical place because of influence of Chinese drama. However, near the entrance, there were many people asking to join day tour and palace guided service. Also, I saw some of people spitting on the floor which was disgusting and dirty."
"Seriously, you have to go here. A couple of tips for you- don't buy the tickets at the first carousel you come to, they're for some gate or something, keep going til you are at the true entrance. Once your there, stand near the ticket carousel and look lost/bewildered. Wait for an English speaking tour guide to approach you, then haggle down the price. If they're a good guide they'll get you in a short line for tickets and then will tell you many fascinating stories of intrigue and scandal in the palace. They'll likely make a stop in at the gift shop. Whatever they try to sell you, don't accept the first price!

The place is crowded, but it's well worth it if you get a tour guide. They'll be able to steer you around a lot of the crowds and show you interesting things that the masses will completely miss!"
"True this a massive complex of incredibly old halls, palaces and gardens. Unfortunately you only get to see the outsides of the buildings. There are a couple that you can look into but only after being pushed by the masses. I have to admit that if you are in Beijing you should see this place. I just don't think you'll really enjoy it."
"The Palace Museum (once known as the Forbidden City) is the massive set of halls, palaces and gardens once reserved only for the Emperors and their Government officials. It is situated immediately north of Tian'anmen Square. From the moment you pass through the Meridian Gate until the time you leave through the Gate of Divine Prowess you are steeped in the centuries old history of China's Imperial dynasties. The Imperial Gardens, and the massive halls of Supreme Harmony and Preserving Harmony as well as the Palaces of Heavenly Purity and Earthly Tranquility were the hi-lights of the tour. Rent an audio guide from the Museum and IGNORE (and I can't say this strongly enough!!!) the hucksters selling individual tours they are vastly overpriced and a total rip off.

The downsides and (the only reason I did not rate this site higher) were the reasons I have already touched upon namely that the space between Tian'anmen Square and the Meridian Gate is chock a block with rip-off artists and hucksters out to separate the gullible from their money ... ignore them. In addition the crowds can be massive and daunting however once you have passed through the bottlenecks at Tian'anmen and the Meridian Gate the crowds disperse quickly though it may remain difficult to get a close up view of the thrones and interiours of the various halls and palaces. There are few places to buy drinks or get protection from the sun or rain so plan accordingly. Once outside the Gate of Divine Prowess take some time to walk along the moat and exteriour wall it is impressive and tranquil (once you have navigated the throng of pedicab operators). The walk back to Tian'anmen is pleasant and brief and for the most part follows the moat and Palace wall."
"A huge complex of palaces, rooms and temples. Very interesting, and a good way to get an impression of the Chinese history and art. I would recommend about 2-3 hours for the visit.
A students discount is available (50%).
Don't bother to rent an audio guide. It's quite primitive and it's impossible to control it (pause, fast forward etc.). Just walk leisurly forward (northward), and stop at spots which look especially interesting or to take photos.
Directions: the north end of Tiananmen square. You cannot miss the large picture of Mao, hanging on the front gate of the forbidden city."
We spent a whole day at the Palace Museum. We bought map at the entrance. The map has a few suggested routes based on how long you want to spend your time at the Palace Museum. We started with half day route but ended up spending the whole day. There were just so many attractions to see! My boyfriend likes the Imperior Garden the most. I really enjoy the Treasurer Gallery and the Clock Gallery. These two galleries are must see attractions within the Palace Museum. We also had lunch at one of the restaurants. Both of us ordered the Beijing noodles and it was just all right. I recommend to try authentic Peking noodles at Hai Wan Ju.
"In general nothing to specially go to Beijing for. Crowded, just another ""tourist"" stop point.
Liked: historical significance
Disliked: nothing really to write about"
it is not possible that travel to Beijing and do not visit this museum. Unfortunately most of halls were close.
Our family went with a tour from Thailand. We spent one hour there. We missed many thing at the Palace because of time constraint. The palace was huge and beautiful. A lot of people were in the afternoon. A must if you visit Beijing.
"the former emperors palace during the ming and qing dynasty ,about 72 hectares,it will take about 3hours to see all ."
"If your coming to Beijing, your visiting here so whats the point of a review?
Entry is now only from the southern end and exiting through the gardens at the northern end. Weekends get packed with local tourists. I went on a thursday in late May and didn't need to line up for tickets and found the crowd pretty small. i was told this was a very quiet day. I organised a private tour guide to take us around and explain the significance of what we were seeing, which added greatly to my appreciation of the place. Get here early and say hello to Chairman Mao across the road and expect to spend a few hours in the Palace."
"The Forbiddent City will tell you what the Chinese culture and Dynasty is all about.

Its a massive structure, and in really good shape, though its centuries old.

You can take the Metro and visit the place on your own. Its just opposite to Tiananmen's Square. As I visited this place in February, it was very cold, so wear a nice thick jacket which will keep u warm...

You can have lazy strolls across this palace.... there are various sections.... which will keep you busy for couple of hours...

There are small food stalls inside this palace, so no need to carry food with you.

You can calmly seat on the benches, and njoy the view and royalty of this palace..

No need to hire a tour guide, unless you want to learn about the culture, dynasty in detail.

After this palace, you can also visit the Tiananmen;s Sqare, which is just on the opposite side of the road."
"Must see place in Beijing. As usual in China, place is huze ,so you need a time for look around . Guss at least 2hours. Audia equip. are available for 35 langgueges at gate at 40Yuan."
"This is a huge complex! Many structures and great history. Once you start seeing the structures in and around Beijing, they all tend to blend together and look alike"
The sheer scale of the place is incredible. You will end up walking miles without noticing it till you get back to the hotel! An experience you shouldn't miss.
"The Forbidden city gives some contest to Imperial China. If you are planning on seeing or have seen you will enjoy the Movie ""The Last Emperor"". Interesting to know you have walked the same streets."
Have look at this impressive buildings. You have to calculate enough time to get into the palace. As it is so big they don't let you get into it in the afternoon
not much of history written- best part is to make a video of yours showing you flying like superman- probably the history is humiliating and therefore people avoid to mention much of it
"The scale and archetecture is amazing, but after a while its very samey. Parts are laid out as they were at the turn of the centuary e.g. Furnished but most areas werent making it hard to envisage what it used to be like. We had an audio guide which was great. It is a sight you have to see but wouldnt go again."
This is a huge parcial of land that used to be the imperial palace of two dynasties. It is about 600 years old and remarkable architecture. It is grand - to say the least. Photo ops abound so make sure your camera is ready for the workout.
"I don't know Chinese history very well but after touring the Forbidden City I want to learn more about the different dynasty's. The place is amazing in how large it is...took several hours to tour, but we did not stop to read every sign. There is plenty to see even if crowded. I highly recommend a 1/2 day here."
"The Forbidden City, was originally the home of the Emperor of China, it covers a huge area off Tiananmen Square. It is a long walk through the complex of Ming built buildings, you cannot go inside the buildings, only look through the doorways or the filmy windows at the antiques of old.
The buildings are traditional Chinese style with large courtyards separating each one, soldiers, staff quarters and old stables run down each side of the complex.
It does get very crowded, so if you want to see into each building you have to be patient or try to squeeze through the crowd, sometimes I just held my camera over everyone's head and clicked away.
The garden area out the back is very beautiful, especially after the long walk through the rest of the palace, where there is even one speck of grass.
It was lovely to see, very impressive, but you can see it better on the Internet"
"It has been restored so well and is full of history that the morning spent here brings to life a entirely different world and one that was lived in this city for so long. The imperial gardens, the clock collections and the different halls were beautiful. Do not go in for automated guide as they don't work too well."
Delightful traditional buildings that demonstrate imperial splendour within a massive site that just goes on and on!
"The Forbidden City boasts vasts yards of uneven brick without a tree in sight. Apparently, the emperor did not want to leave shadows for assassins to hide in.
The garden at the very end is therefore a sight for sore eyes. That being said, the buildings and courtyards are very impressive."
The Forbidden City (Imperial Palace) is not to be missed as the grandeur and scale of the home of the emperors over hundreds of years is quite remarkable. At least half a day is required to walk around the City but longer would give a more relaxed period to explore the buildings.
"This is a beautiful, big palace. Visiting the Forbidden City was on my list of things to do in Beijing. I guess I was very curious about it since it was a place that many people could not enter for centuries. I was very fortunate to have Chinese friends who took me around. We first went to Jingshan Park for spectacular views of the palace, then went all around the palace. This palace has so much Chinese history and culture. You learn a lot more just by visiting it. Make sure you wear comfortable shoes because it is huge. I think it is the biggest palace in the world by its size. I enjoyed visiting the Forbidden City. Make sure you see it if you are in Beijing."
"If you are lucky enough to explore this historic gem on your own rather than with a tour, don’t go until slightly after noon—the morning tours will have left and the afternoon tours haven’t arrived yet. Try to avoid weekends too. You may be approached by many friendly folks anxious to help you get a ticket faster or cheaper or provide you with a guided tour and if you feel like it it may be ok—but a) don’t give anyone money to go buy your ticket, stick with them, and b) you really CAN explore this on your own--just leave LOTS of time! If you really want to go with someone though, you'll likely get a better tourguide if you do some research in advance and book with a reputable firm or person rather than picking up a guide on the morning of."
To me this was slightly overrated as a highlight of Beijing. It is very crowded and hard to be comfortable because of this. The colours on the restored sections are good.
"We started our tour of China in Beijing, and we started our tour of Beijing at the Forbidden City. Plan to spend at least half a day here as it is very busy. While the interior of the buildings are now mostly closed off to the public, the grounds are amazing to walk through. Many of the buildings's doorways are open so that tourists may take a peek inside, but be prepared for a little pushing and shoving (nothing malicious, just a lot of people trying to have their turn to take in the sight). Unfortunately, this is a get in, take a shot, get out process. However, you can take the time to enjoy the grandeur I the grounds at your own leisure."
"forbidden it used to be. Now, big attraction so you are allowed to go in. So it is public now. Just go there you have to"
"We spent an hour trying to find the entry, after a supposed ""20 minute walk"" from our hotel. Il catch a cab next time. The main grounds were impressive, the rest looked all the same. Don't need to spend very long here. Should've got an auto guide."
"After having seen all the chinese serials, I really looked forward to the Forbidden City. Maybe it was our guide who did not do a good job as we were given only 45 min to appreciate the place. Other than going to the main building, we were not allowed to go anywhere. And we could see that most buildings were closed.

The place seems a lot smaller and less grandeur than shown in the movies. It is such a pity because this is the palace for the Emperor and I thought a lot more maintenance would be put into preserving this place and the grandeur of it.

Still, it would be a place you would want to visit if it is your first time to Beijing. Perhaps it might not be good to have a tour guide unless you it is private tour guide for just you and your group.

I think I would visit one more time if I get to go to Beijing again - just to review my own impression of the place."
Amazing this huge scale and lots of precious treasure!! 500 years this place was closed from public. You should prepae to go there 9am and come out 5pm. We spent half day and missed cocubines house...
"Wow is all i can say.Though this was my second visit to the Forbidden City It has been spruiced up since my last visit but after spending 4 hours here i saw things that I did not see on my first Visit.This Palace Complex is Huge IMPRESSIVE & OVER THE TOP

A guide is a must to understand each building its purpose & how the city functioned in Imperial Times"
"Don't worry about the crowd, the place is huge enough. Each one of the impressive and magnificent 980 buildings or gardens had a function and have a very interesting history. Even the garden stones have history. Without a guide you will never know it, therefore, hire an authorized guide and be ready to walk for 3 or 4 hours and learn about 6 centuries of Chinese history. The light in May is splendid to take pictures. Spend US$ 5 to rent the emperor clothes and take some pictures. You and your friends will laugh a lot seeing it. Never step on the wood step that exists in all doors. it was to keep away the bad spirits. If you step on it, it will bring you bad luck (how to know it without a guide?)"
"A great deal of Chinese history, education, and culture in one place. Be prepared to spend most of the day, and get a guide if you can. We arrived late, but our guide got us through the highlights quickly. The added insight, stories, and secret corners were well worth the additional cost."
"We were on an organised tour in June 2012 when we visited the Forbidden City which is across the road from the Tiananmen Square (that you can get to via the underground tunnel/pathway).

The Forbidden City was the Chinese Imperial Palace and for 500 years it was the home of the emperor - it now houses the Palace Museum.

After entering through the Heavenly Gates, we explored the inner city including the outer and inner sanctums. You can wander freely through many of the rooms which now have antiques on display from that era (although not all rooms/buildings were open). The Concubines weren’t open to the public but we could see them thru the windows – not that there was much to see.

It was surreal to think we were allowed to walk down the road where, in past centuries, only the Emperor was allowed to walk .. with one exception, the Empress and that was only on her wedding day.

Be careful when leaving the Forbidden City precinct, as we were “mobbed” by the various street vendors who were not only selling junk souvenirs but also food like watermelon and frozen corn cobs.

Otherwise an interesting historic place and it was worth a visit - after all, you couldn't really travel all the way to Beijing and not visit it."
"All for one person as well ! Watch The Lost emperor before you go here and walk on the real life set, very impressive, take lots of water as it gets hot."
"Like a lot of people I had looked forward to visiting the Forbidden City and had a tingle of expectation as we approached, unfortunately my expectations went unfulfilled. Yes it is steeped in history and yes the buildings are architecturally beautiful but it appears to have been left without any care and attention being lavished upon it.
The buildings you can enter have very little in them, the buildings you can not enter are difficult to see into due to years of dust and grime on the windows plus the enormous hordes of Chinese people pushing and shoving there way to the front. It is a shame that such an iconic place is being left to decompose as it surely will if something is not done. The sheer number of visitors makes it difficult to enjoy what there is to be seen. This is typical of so many Chinese heritage sites. I hate to be so negative but find it difficult to write anything enlightening, what China needs is a National Trust to to preserve and cherish its heritage."
The Forbidden City is a required part of any visit to Beijing and for good reason. It is a massive and really impressive center to the city (and the center of the world according to old Chinese legend). We had a great time exploring and experiencing all that the Forbidden City had to offer. Anybody traveling to Beijing would be hard pressed to miss out.
"It was on the the top of my list and I found the site to be very impressive. As you work your way from the south gate to the north you become more amazed. Be certain to always look up around the buildings to see the intricate carvings and painting.
It almost becomes a maze as it has some many walls within walls.
As you get to the gardens, you may be surprised how different it is. Magnificat all the way.
Many placards are in English, but I do understand the audio tour can provide a lot more information ( though almost the same cost as the entrance fee - still reasonable )
Allow up to a half day, maybe more depending on your desired pace. I do have to say though, be certain to allow a half day as well for The Temple of Heaven, do not miss this one either."
"I would certainly like to recommend going here with a guide who can explain everuthing to you, you just get so much more of the story, than going there by yourself"
"Ignorantly, I was unaware of the massive size of the Forbidden City. It seems to go on forever! The buildings are ornate and beautiful. They have amazing detail and the paintings one the walls are also highly detailed."
"Having heard so much about this, I was really excited. Yes it was hot and busy (to be expected), but I was disappointed at the the number of closed buildings. My partner visited 5 years ago and said most of temples were open and there were exhibits and explanations and interpretation. Not so nowadays. Just seemed to be loads of tourist parties and shut buildings. Sorry folks..."
We were really looking forward to seeing the Forbidden City and although it is vast and you marvel at grandeur that once was - it is not there now. It is a shame that everything inside the buildings have gone apart from a couple which you are not allowed in and they haven't cleaned the windows for a century! Yes we took some great pictures of the buildings but we were expecting a great deal more. All I can say is that if you are visiting China you have to visit the Forbidden City but go with lower expectations than we did. Two other things - expect hoards of people and the toilets are awful so go at your hotel !!
"Very impressive for its size and architecture, but also horribly busy, taking away a lot from the experience.

Avoid eating or drinking inside the grounds. It's just too expensive."
"The Forbidden City (Imperial Palace) is not to be missed as the grandeur and scale of the home of the emperors over hundreds of years is quite remarkable.
At least half a day is required to walk around the City but longer would give a more relaxed period to explore the buildings.
This is a must see in Beijing"
"Tough to know where to start. Everything about the place is great. The headphones are a must, unless you have a super knowledgeable guide. They even show where you have been and where you need to go. This is a must see sight for anyone in Beijing."
"the size and architecture of this is impressive and unbelievable... so many amazing details in the architecture. very crowded and if you're looking to get pictures without people in them, good luck! so worth the visit."
"Whilst undoubtably impressive, our visit was somewhat marred by the vast crowds - it was the May Day national holiday and Beijing was thronged by Chinese tourists from every part of this enormous country. I think they all decided to go to Tiananmen Square and the Forbidden Palace together. It was interesting to people-watch and to be photographed by and with so many complete strangers! However, it was impossible to really appreciate the architecture and grounds in such crowds. My advice is not to go during a public holiday!"
The scale of this place is amazing. Audio guides useful and plenty to see and learn. A must see for Beijing.
Takes most of the day. A lot of sameness but the garden is quite wonderful with very interesting trees.
"I had very high expectations on this place, since it's one of the world's most famous destinations ever. I had been traveling for a month in China, and was already used to dealing with chinese people, but this was too much.
It's millions of tourists, literally, walking one hitting and pushing each other, in a sea of chinese crowds that all they do is take random pictures and shout with their amplifiers.
The city is very big, and in theory amazing, full of ancient temples and spectacular details. But the truth is that you can't apreciate none of them. Since there are so many people, all of the buildings are closed, so you just can see the outside (wich look pretty much the same one to the other), except 2 or 3 that have one single gate open, from which you can ""see"" to the inside from behind some bars. Of course you have to push dozens of people in order to get to the first line and be able to see sth inside.
So it's really imposible to make a connection with the place. It's just not prepared to receive so many people, and it's very bad planned. Because they just charge the tickets, and make millions of dollars, but don't care about the bad service they are offering.
I think they should limit the entries per day, selling tickets in advance, so that the people who are inside can really get to know the place, see the inside of the buildings, and feel how souch a ""forbidden"" place should fell. That's the way they do it in the Alambra in Granada, and it really works!!
I give it 2 stars just because of the historical importance of the place, but my experience, was really a 1 star..."
"The forbidden city and tiananmen square are must-see sites for anyone visiting Beijing. Like most things in China it is hard to conceive of the scale and detail of these areas until you are actually there. Because of the low-rise surroundings once you are in the city you don't see modern buildings so you are surrounded by walls, gardens and palaces. You get a real sense of what feudal China may have been like. There are gate, after gate, after gate, but the reward of seeing the inner areas are worth the effort. There's lots of walking on some uneven paving stones so wear comfortable shoes.

Go with a guide—either private or group—to get detail about the history and context of what you're seeing. The historical significance of the Mao tomb and soviet-era buildings juxtaposed with the historical buildings is important to understand. Also its important to be sensitive to cultural and political issues that still are there, so don't try discussing the student demonstrations, crack-down, or make jokes about Mao's publicly."
"Hey, it's the forbidden city so it was on the bucket list but what a shame the way it's being ""maintained"" by the local authorities. It's a shame to see a world heritage site decay like this for lack of attention. All the walls are in awful shape, the ceilings, there are holes in the ground every other step on the whole site, weeds coming out of the buildings, stairs, etc... and what's with the smell...? I guess the plan is to let time eat the place away, what a shame, if you haven't been there yet hurry up before it gets worst. I suggest you exit the place thru the front door (Tianmen Square) so you save yourself the sights of the dozens of deformed people waiting for tourists at the back door begging for a few coins..."
"We were unprepared for the size of the City and wished we had spent longer there. You need a day to explore. The crowds were a little overwhelming at times, but the scale and beauty of the city are worth it. Do go with a good guide so you understand more about what you are seeing. This is a wonder of the world and worth seeing."
"The overall visit was excellent. It was possible, in spite of the crowds, to get a good feel for the whole area, The only criticism I had was that the rooms on display looked as if they had never been dusted since the last emperor lived there, perhaps that is intentional but to western eyes it looks a bit odd. Still worth the visit."
"The Forbidden City (FC), while not on my 'bucket list', is something I definitely wanted to visit during my time in China. Obviously due to its location, this followed my trip to Tiananmen Square.

Admission fee to main section: 60CNY

You need to join the 'mass ranks' crossing the bridge to enter FC and be prepared to be hit with many hawkers offering you a guide. Some people may want a guide, the bits I overheard from one or two inside were actually very informative. If you want a guide, I suggest arranging prior to your visit through reviews on websites, Trip Advisor has many. It would be a shame to say yes and then be disappointed. There are ticket offices located both sides, don't be put off by the queue. Mine was about 20-30 people deep but it moved very quickly. After getting your ticket you can move to the main square, after more people offering you tours.

You're going to have to get used to forceful 'No's' or as I started doing, just waking on not even acknowledging. From there you can explore to your hearts content, within the places you're able to access of course. I spent a at least 2 hours having a look around. I also opted for the 'treasure' add on for 10CNY. You can see some artefacts from way back, providing you can see past the tour groups. They really annoyed me during my time in FC. I found them quite obnoxious. Personally, I wouldn't recommend the add on but if you are hell bent on seeing as much as possible, then as I say, it's only 10 yuan.

Again there was some restoration work going on inside and a couple of times you HAVE to walk through a gift shop if following a certain route.

The detailing on the buildings was very intricate, and you can appreciate the work that went in to bring it to that standard. Would I recommend it? Yes. You can't not see it really can you? Rating for me is 3/5 mainly due to the fact you have to purchase more tickets for a change of scenery from looking at the outside of buildings and it was spoilt by the tour groups (though not the attractions fault!)."
We enjoyed our visit throughout here. We were limited to the amount of time we had while on a tour that started in Tiananmen square and ended walking through and out the back of this place. Then we hopped onto our bus and onto our next sight. We were able to take a lot of photos of this area and surrounding Tiananmen square. We enjoyed the architecture. This place was so crowded. I noticed they had lots of uniformed guards and also plainclothes security watching everyone coming into the entrance.
"Everyone says that the Forbidden City is a must-see when you visit Beijing, so what can one do but to follow their lead and go there.

Once you pop up from the subways station at Tian'anmen square, and see all the people outside ready to storm the Imperial palace, you get a notion of how popular this site is. As a westerner, you should be prepared to be jumped by eager guides as you fight your way to the entrance. All wanting to sell you their services. We decide to skip the guide this time, as we are here in the middle of winter, and it's freezing cold - so we hope to just have a fast peek at the Palace. (Without knowing anything about the size of this Palace - you simply can't have a fast peek, since it's hugemongous - but we don't know that yet)

We pay the 80 Yuan, and enter the gates...Luckily the place is so large, that you don't get disturbed by the thousands that are already inside. Once more we have to struggle with another set of hucksters and eager guides.

So, what about the sights ? You will get a lot of architecture, since that is what it's moslty about - large squares, ornamentation, statues and so on. When you get further into the Palace, you may enter some other departments with art collections or closed gardens etc - BUT, then you will have to pay an additional fee before entering. :(

We are now a couple of hour in to our visit, and we are literally freezing our [--] off - a quick stop in one of the coffee shops for a warming cup of java before we leave the premises.

If you, or should I say, when you visit this place, put on a pair of comfortable shoes, select moderate weather and buy yourself a guide who can show you the most valuable sights and fill the historic gaps. Enjoy =)"
I felt like we were being pushed thru this site like cattle. It is so crowded and noisy. I think that you can go to a lot of temples (like the Temple of Heaven) in the area to see the architecture and don't need to waste your time going thru the Forbidden City. It was nice to go to the Drum Tower and look out over the Forbidden City.
"huge , wonderful buildings, lots of people watching experiences,Better than the guide books states and much more,being in shape is very helpful."
"LIKED:
1) Historical aspects. Both the architecture and archaeological value.
2) An opportunity to understand the life style of the ancient Greats.
3) The artistic skill of the ancient Chinese.

Disliked:
1) The great disparity of the RICH and POOR.
2) Poor maintenance of some the architecture and art work.
3) Poor display of the art treasures (eg. lightings, compositions etc)
4) Poor control of the massive visitors."
"The sheer size of this place is impressive but compared to other palaces in the Far East (e.g. Thailand, Vietnam) it is quite bland. It's also incredibly crowded with tourists (mostly Chinese) so it's very difficult to get a look at the exhibits. But it was very interesting to hear from our guide how it was used by the Emperors and their concubines."
The best part about the Forbidden City is comprehending the size of it. Each of the gates seemed repetitive and perhaps I was just overwhelmed. The long stone is fascinating to see and some of the tile work on the gates and walls are beautiful. I was really disappointed in the palace garden which didn't have any flowers.
Be sure and take your camera. Try to get a local guide to explain all the history associated with this site. Be prepared to walk without handrails
"We recently ended a cruise in Beijing, and only had 1 day to see the sights. Princes Cruises offered a 1 day city tour that was great. Temple of Heaven, Forbidden City, lunch and Tiananmen Square. Long day but worth it.

The Forbidden City was really different, I loved the roof ornaments. The emperors believed 9 to be the lucky number, so the Palace has 9,999 rooms. They were also paranoid, and slept in a different bedroom every night, there are dozens. There is also no foliage, or other artworks that anyone could hide in. In the main areas the doors have 9 rows of ornaments, showing that that was an area the Emperor would use. Also the fabulous roof ornaments on the Emperors quarters have 9 figures on the roof. I loved the ornaments and they were for sale in the museum gift shop. You could buy a set of 9 (who knew) or a set of 4. Since we're not royalty I bought the set of 4 for about $15 USD. Very good quality. This is a great museum shop.

The buildings go on forever, the area is surrounded by a moat that the Emperor would sneak out on. There is not a lot to see as far as the buildings go, but the ornamentation is remarkable. It is very clean, and being restored on a constant basis.

It was very crowded the day we were there, early May, and that time is a holiday for the Chinese people, and they apparently all wanted to go to the Forbidden City. We had been told that people would stare at Westerners, as we've only been seen on TV by the Chinese. But we weren't prepared that they wanted to take our picture with their family. Like these are our ""American Cousins"". Very weird. Propaganda? Who knows. Little kids giving us the ""V"" hand sign, as in 'peace"".

I want to see the movie ""The Last Emperor"" again, as it was shot there by special permission. the last Emperor committed suicide when he realized the end had come for the China he knew. Beijing was a most interesting place, one that I would go back too. Not so much Shanghai or Singapore."
"I am not going to spend time writting about the history of this place, you can find more accurate info in Wikipedia :-).
We visit it by ourselves. You can take a Taxi or the Subway. Everything is well signed so you are not get lost. We spend around 3 hours inside. We didn't pay for a guide because We had all the information in our tablets (maps, routes, history), but you can hire one just in the entrance.
Sometimes is hard to take pictures inside the palaces (because the crowd) but really there is not too much to see inside of them.
You are going to enjoy a lot just by walking around the palaces and taking pictures (a lot!!!). If you are Beijing you MUST visit this place.
I will recommend to visit http://www.travelchinaguide.com/ web site to get more info about history, routes, fee and open hours of this place. (We used that Web site to program all the places that We visit in China..100% recomendable)."
This palace is massive and has great history. But much of it is closed. You start at the southern entrance and work your way north. It is packed but crowds move quickly. A guide to give the history is very helpful as the construction is at times more complicated than you might think.
"When we visited imperial palace, forbidden city was closed due to maintenance, so we went to Summer Palace instead."
"I went there 3rd time, The maintenance work carried out for the Olympics was visible. The fresh restoration of the gold work and carvings was clearly visible as compared to my last visit."
"The Forbidden City was the Chinese imperial palace from the Ming Dynasty to the end of the Qing Dynasty. That's a long time ago. Stop and think of it. And the Chinese rulers yesterday or today have a slow efficient way, strict way, a different way all together.
It is part of a visit to Beijing, you kind of have not to miss it, but don't have any expectation, please; they will be a lot of people and the....groups ( Chinese always travel in groups). So the visit is slow way, and not easy to see well specially if you are into photo.
But you are in China, in Beijing, so you go...."
"We watched the Last Emperor on DVD the night before we left for China. It helped us all to appreciate the Forbidden City, especially the children who had little knowledge of Chinese history before this trip. As we walked through we could imagine Puyi living there. It's a must see."
"Yes it's crowded, but that is China- get use to it! Go back in time and enjoy looking around at a leisurely pace. Get a guide if you can afford it, my wife is a Beijing'er so I was very lucky to have her explain everything. It's huge and just like in the movie Last Emperor, make sure you take those priceless photos. I have visited a few years ago, but still enjoyed coming back."
"This tour is a must for beijing. Once you enter, you must complete the tour as there is no turning back. Some of the halls are massive. In contrast the rooms for the masters were quite small. That a city after so many hundreds of years still exists is remarkable. There has een fires there, but those buildings have been restored. A lot is still hidden under the cobblestones. This whole project will sill be ongoing for many decades. Funding comes for the entrance fees ole tied and believe me
There are thousands a day. The day we went, it was 6 degrees Celcius but the tourists, many Chinese from the country were piling in"
Trip to forbidden city was very entertaining as it is difficult to believe that chairman Mao would want to keep all this historical past of Chinas old emperors with all their connections to lots of concubines and the way they lived in the past.Our guide was very knowledgable and made it a good experience
This is a sprawling complex and is very busy with Chinese visitors who flock to this impressive palace. However despite the crowds it's a great place to visit and you get a real feel of how the emperors used to live.
I was expecting little bit more out of my visit here. It contained a ton of walking. At some points the crowds of people were so ridiculous of not letting other people through to take a quick photo of the Emperors room etc. the garden was magnificent and was probably the only part out of the whole 'city' I enjoyed. You can't really take photos of the rooms they stayed in back then since it was locked and the windows were all fogged up due to them not keeping it in great conditions. There are some artsy stuff to see along the way in some buildings.
"It's an imperial wonder and a great experience, just be prepared for a LOT of people. Still, a ""must-see"". We went with a private guide and that made all the different - he pointed out so many things, architectural and historical, that we would otherwise have missed."
"Of course, everyone must visit the Forbidden City while in Beijing. Our guide navigated our small group to the most important areas. It was not quite as overwhelming. After visiting, see the movie ""The Last Emperor."" It was made there."
"I'd recommend watching the Last Emperor prior to visiting, the movie isn't historically accurate but does provide some context that will make your visit more interesting."
"It is the thing that you must see in Beijing and it is pretty amazing. The architecture in itself is not mind-blowing, but the space as a whole is incredible. Expect huge crowds and noisy tours if you visit though. Also, the buildings could do with a bit of a face-lift. The Chinese tourists have a tendency to touch everything, so there is a bit of wear and tear. The paintwork could do with a touch-up.

It is iconic and any trip to Beijing is not complete without it. Go there, but prepare to wade through the crowds."
"This is a must-see when visiting Beijing. It seems that everyone agrees because the crowds are huge. We spent about 3 hours just going through the middle of it. We could easily have spent another 3 hours if we had visited the buildings on the east and west axes. At many of the buildings we had to squeeze up to the door to get a quick glimpse. If you don't like being jostled, it may be uncomfortable. After a while we grew weary of the crowds and wanted to get out. You must run a gauntlet of hawkers and touts on the way out. This was one of those experiences that wasn't completely pleasant at the time, but we were glad we did it. Now we have to go home and re-watch those old movies that feature the Forbidden City."
"Second time to visit the Forbidden City. First time was overwhelmed by the scale of it and the many buildings, courtyards, garden area, etc. Second time we encountered some buildings being renovated so at least one of the main halls was inaccessible and some construction noise. Overall, still impressed by the magnitude of it all and it could consume a whole day."
"With 9,999 and 1/2 rooms this is quite a remarkable site. It is not possible to go into any of the rooms but just walking through the whole complex is an amazing experience. We hired a guide so that we could understand some of the history and culture.

It gets incredibly busy so would recomend a very early start. Recommend a minimum of 2 hours."
"Beijing has its historical importance and in that Forbidden city is one of them. The Palace, the ancient structures and the architecture is something not to be missed."
"Historical it is but it really is like any other Palace you can see all over the world, peering in dusty windows with not much to see. Unfortunately we timed our visit with the 3 day public holiday -April 29 to May 1- so all attractions were mobbed! Its not in the nature of the Chinese to queue or have manners so this made the visit uncomfortable too. So, avoid the holidays (and if you suffer from hey fever pollen is a big problem) and go see the Lama Temple for an interesting time without the crowds."
"A must for first timer. Avoid to go on weekend since you will ve flooded with swarm of people. This also will be a bit annoying specially when you're being pushed around while seeing an exhibit.

I you're not with a tour guide, i reccommend you to take the virtual voice guide, they're only 40 RMB. Because without the history lesson and the stories, this place id nothing but a very large palace with lots of exhibit.

Tips: use comfortable shoes and bring water! Drinks and food are expensive here.

The downside is that i think the local people is very ignorant with their heritage and artefact. They touch and even sit on top of the centuries old statues. Jumping fences and trashing all around the place. It's a shame to see the glorious past of a great nation being disrespected like that."
"It will takes one day, therefore start your visit in the morning.
You should have map or automatic tourist guide except you will loose some attraction."
"Hard to know what to say, its massive, steeped in history, packed full of tourists, and quite simply unmissable on any trip to Beijing. No paper in the toilets, so bring a roll with you"
"The Palace is simply an amazing architecture with intriguing history behind it. Since you cannot go into the buildings, you only have the chance to see all of them from outside, though it is still wonderful scenery to take some pictures. If you don't go with a private tour guide who has the knowledge, the place will become boring as almost all the buildings look similar.

Be ready to walk, carry water and wet wipes/tissues. Avoid going on weekends and public holidays. Better to visit on a Monday where there will be considerably less people."
The Chinese are certainly making up for the fact that they weren't able to visit this in the past ;-) - it is very crowded. The size of it is quite impressive although a lot of it looked the same through my western eyes. If you pay a bit extra to get to the section with the 9 dragons screen you will have the opportunity to enjoy some quieter sections.
"OK so i guess if you go to Beijing you have to go. However, dont get too excited. Crowds Crooks and Yawn .... nothing to see what you cant google. I spent most of the day across the road at the National Museum. The architecture is incredible. The exhibits are wonderful. Still, as i say. you cant go to Beijing and not endure the crowds and crooks and visit this place. Stay away from those Rickshaws we were taken for a ride."
"Simply amazing to visit a place with such ancient history behind it. We were advised not to get a guide and to instead rent the audio guide for 40 rmb per person. It can be quite a task to convince the pushy guides outside that you dont want take part in their tour, but its all a part of the experience. Be sure to go to the main gate where everyone is going and not fall into the trap from the ""poor"" art students with good english that want you to first see their art exhibition. This also can be a task, as they seem very nice and polite."
"Beware of fake guides and taxi drivers, Very crowded Place and u have to buy tkt to enter and different room with different ticket price. Its better u buy book or read info online than to take a fake guide from there"
"It is a must see for all tourists. Do take a guided tour as the guides have a million stories about the Emperor and his 3,000 concubines."
"I don't think it was blasphemous that in such a revered and awesome place that my kids were playing tag and hide-and-seek. It's massive. That's my word to describe most things in Beijing! Toilet facilities are really smelly. Bring toilet paper along for bathrooms since you cannot depend on public toilets to have them. We barely scratched the surface of it, walking from the entrance gate (South Gate) to the exit (North Gate), but it was worth the 2-3 hours of walking. Although it was a little crowded with all the tour groups, once you got inside, I liked that it was away from the traffic-clogged streets of Beijing. I'd go back to do the guided audio tour and see all the exhibits in the halls."
"Fee to get in the park, + another fee ($10US) to get into the palace is worth it to grasp the enormity of the property. Very hectic/ unpleasant getting out. Be wary of taxi drivers who charge 100rmb for 20 ride. Also many sales people for tours. They drag it out. Better to buy a book about the history, or read online."
"Of course this historically significant site should be visited if you are able. Admission is very reasonable and the grounds are magnificently vast and inspiring when you consider the emperors and their servants lived and did business here.

However, expect large crowds and don't expect to see inside any of the buildings themselves. All the buildings and any artifacts are pretty much closed to the public. What you will see are the grounds and layout and garden areas.

We visited mid-May and the lines were extremely long to get in and it was HOT."
"Visit this imposing palace and you would be impressed, even if you do not understand the history behind it."
"If you let your imagination run wild and remember scenes from movies like ""The Last Emperor"" you will be awed by the history and what has happened in this place. If you look, with the thousands of other tourists who are there, only at the current physical size and structure you may be underwhelmed. There is a large degree of sameness in the structure and you wouldn't want to live here."
"The Forbidden City covers a much larger area than I imagined, even though I had researched it considerably in advance. I had wanted to visit here since I was a child, my mother had described it to me and shown me pictures as a young boy, almost 60 years ago. A friend who visited here a year ago said that the building all look the same after a while. This is why a good guide is priceless. While the buildings are numerous and in similar style, the story behind each building, the shape of the gates, the colour of the roofs etc, the plotting and politics, the history and stories help make your visit so memorable. Catherine Lu our guide, bought the tickets and whisked us past queues and knew the site so well that she could navigate so much more easily than we could have done alone. Allow at least 3 hours."
A must see once in a lifetime. Lots of different areas to visit. Do hire a electronic guide when you are there.
"Cool place esp if you are into some serious history! Just wanted to fore warm people about this scam. My husband and I are experienced travellers and have been to several countries backpacking. We agreed at the exit of the forbidden city to get in a rickshaw for 3 yen to the Lama Temple. All was going well until another rickshaw pulled up along side us and told us to get in our own rickshaws because we were too heavy to both stay in one! Obviously didn't agree to that and a new rickshaw driver hopped on. A rather stocky Mongolian guy who spoke English... After being taken down several Hutongs the driver stopped abc said the temple was around the corner. He then demanded we have him 300 yen, got very aggressive, made us give him all the money we had then made me empty my bag to prove we had no more money. Not a pleasant exp at all and we were left stranded down a back alley just 1/4 mile from the forbidden city! Spoke to a Chinese guide the next day about it and he said the Mongolians in Beijing are like mafia and the police can't do anything about these scams. would recommend you use the subway or push bike to get around to avoid you having to experience this. We then noticed 100s if other rickshaw drivers doing the same trick to tourists."
everything was great beautiful place to visit - a must do once in life time. again the guides were knowledge and i enjoyed ebery piece of it
"One of the most crowded tourist attractions in Beijing. Make your way through the hoards of chinese tourists and take a stroll through the formerly forbidden city. You will probably need 2-3 hours to walk through the grounds properly. I recommend getting the virtual tour guide to discover exactly what you are looking at. This is a must see if you are visiting Beijing, although it is probably one of the most overrated places to visit."
"The best place to discover the history of the lost empire and its treasures. Great jewellery, jade, gold and silver artworks in the Treasure Gallery. Authentic rooms to view through the windows. Endless corridors and pavilions."
Great experience. China has come a long way since the Emperor's were in control. A live history lesson.
"After a month in China I was completely underwhelmed with the Forbidden City. Architecturally it doesn't look that different from other Chinese sights and the crowds are so immense you can't enjoy any moment without being pushed around or surrounded by a tour group with a gobby tour guide shouting on their megaphone. I was thoroughly bored and couldn't wait to leave. Its upside is that its 60 RMB, relatively cheap compared to other tourist sites in China. If you've just arrived in China maybe it would be interesting but personally I would skip it and just visit Jingshan Park instead and enjoy the nice view over the city and beyond. Its also closed on Monday afternoons except for in July and August."
This is a wonderful place to visit. Tourists must always remember that the public toilets are not like we have have in the west - check the door sign for type of facility behind the door. Toiket tissues and wet wipes are a real must wherever you go in China .!
"Entrance is nice and of course its impressive and all. But is pretty much the same seen one seen them all kind of feeling.
Be careful if you go there first of may there will be guards with fire extinguishers in front of the entrance ready to put out people who set themselves on fire in somekind of protest maneuver. We walked by other days and it was calm but they seemed to expect this kind of thing on labour day."
"Great visit-massive!!! It just keeps on going!! You need at least half a day for this...take your time, with a guide was great but there is an automatic guide you can rent for 40rmb near the entrance as you ho in (south entrance). It is very full even on the day we went which was a quiet day!! But much to see and just do big. Watch out for scammers, we never got touched as just 2 of us with private guide, but even so if you are not interested from the start they tend to leave you alone.... Dont be afraid of walking through on your own, but if you are lucky and can get a private guide it is much better. When you exit dont be shocked at dome of the injured people singing in the street for money... Also there are some pushy sellers trying to sell books and maps etc just walk past and shake your hesd and they leave you alone, definitely must see part of Beijing!"
"We were impressed with how big the Forbidden City actually is. Very interesting and a good way to learn about Chinese history and culture. The imperial garden at the back of the Forbidden City is lovely and is a huge contrast to the starkness of the rest of the complex. Very highly recommended, particularly with a private guide."
How many rooms can a palace have? this place is huge and rich with Chinese history . It is well worth getting a guide for this attraction and a must do when in Beijing. The architecture is incredible and the palace grounds is a photographer's haven.
"was reminded of the movie ""the last Emperor"" all the time. It is THE tourist attraction in Beijing of course and a must SEE."
Meaningful history. A must visit when in Beijing. We were travelling with two children under 7 and they too enjoyed their visit.
"This is where the Emperor and his concubines lived. I can understand why it was forbidden to the public. This is a walled area and was very impressive, as far as the architecture and layout."
We rushed through the attraction because we don't know much about the story/history of every gate/object. So it was pretty pointless staying at one spot for too long.
"Just imagining what it must have taken to build this is amazing. Look at the floor in the Emperor's garden section. Thousands of little mosaics, and that's just one small detail of that whole neighborhood. Simply amazing!"
"You need to spend time here and we were sadly whisked through on our tour but the architecture is awe inspiring. We entered from Tian an men square and it felt like entering another world. Gone was the hustle and bustle of the city - it felt like we had gone back in time. Where the film the Last Emperor was shot, the home of the emperor and no women. Endless rows of glazed tiles, and other wonderful ceramic creations. Peer through dusty windows to see the bed of the emperor or his wife. Admire the bronze animals used to burn incense and the stone dragon heads used to divert water from the upper level walk ways. I want to go back soon"
"This is the attraction in Beijing and even in the whole China. But at first is can seem a bit boring. It's best to read about the history before going or getting the audioguide. Make sure the visit the side parts away from the main drag as that is where you will see the rooms that are still furnished. The gardens at the end are nice too.

If you want to visit the Hall of Treasures you need to be there on time (before 16:00)! It is towards the back of the complex."
"Go early in the morning this way you avoid the crowd. Take your time to see everything, it take at lease 3 to 4 hrs to visit the place."
"I visited the Forbidden City in a half-day in early April and wish I'd had more time there. It is a gigantic complex of almost 10,000 rooms, each of which served a different purpose and had different artifacts to view. We took a path more or less straight down the middle which allowed us to view several of the most important sections of the City including the Hall of Supreme Harmony. The lava rocks towards the north end were really impressive too!

One tip is that behind the City there is a hill upon which is a small Buddhist temple. For RMB2 you can climb to the top and get a great view of Beijing and the overall City; on clear-sky days it's a wonderful photo spot!"
No need to hire a guide just rent the audio tour. A wonderful and historic experience. Very busy with Chinese tourists and would recommend visiting in the winter months for a quieter visit. Allocate at least half a day to do the visit justice
The Forbidden City is a must see if you visit Beijing. Lots of history and it is beautiful. A must is a guide or an audio guide to be able to identify and learn about this part of Chisese history.
"I've seen some tour operators who offer the Great Wall and the Forbidden City in one day. I suppose if you only had one day in China, and you were super fit, you might do that, but otherwise - forget it! Done a review of the Wall, this one is about the Forbidden City.
Allow a day. Take your time. Eat lunch there. Don't rush. Poke into all the nooks and crannies, of which there are LOTS!!!!
It is huge. I see the recommended time is 2-3 hours. Yeah???? Running, not stopping to look, maybe. I can understand that people would find it disappointing if they spend only that amount of time. A bit like people go to the Louvre in Paris, look at Mona Lisa, and say it looked better in the Da Vinci Code.
Walk around. Sit down. Join the inevitable queues and go to the other bits that are there. Yes, you have to pay, and the Chinese are catching on as to how to squeeze the extra dollars out of tourists. But how much has it cost you to get there? Why miss things which matter, because of the extra cost.
One of the highlights for me was - the incredible amount, and quality, of the glazed ceramic tiles and bits all over the place. Hard to comprehend the amount of it, and impossible to think of the cost of the same thing today. Look up, as well - the buildings are decorated right to the top.
Summary - take your time, start early, stay all day."
"the forbidden city was recommended for 2-3 hr tour with guide, to get information and feel this history place"
Interesting to see how the chinese kings lived. Not as grand as the Mughals or Europeans. Avoid the weekends as local tourist flood the place with annoying guides screaming on microphones.
"I suppose you have to do it if you are in Beijing, but be prepared for a touristy, crowded experience. Not the most spectacular palaces in Asia and lots of it under refurbishment and off limits, but interesting to see. Very little you can actually get into, so you see most by peering through (dirty) glass if you can get close enough because of the thousands of people. Dressing up is fun if a little tacky. Best fun is that all the Asian visitors want to take your photo as there are surprisingly few westerner s there. DO NOT get in rickshaws outside, especially if, like us, you are dropped at the exit instead of the entrance - they are going to rip you off and we had a bit of a scary experience. Also really hard to find taxis around the area. Loads of hawkers trying to sell you tours and guides as you enter and exit which is a bit off putting. Not the best experience of China but I guess it has to be done..."
"We turned up the the Forbidden City and while waiting to get get our tickets were approached by a guy wanting to give us a tour. We live in Shanghai and are wary of tourist traps and scams, but Mark was the real deal! A hard working young Chinese Man recently married. At a price of 200 RMB off we went.

Marks enthusiasm and knowledge of the history on the Dynasties was fret. He brought the stories down to something our kids could understand, and bobbed down to their level to talk to them.

After 1.5 hours we were ready to go And this amazing man spent 20 minutes of crazy ness to secure a cab for us to get back to our hotel.

We loved the Forbidden City, made even more memorable due to Mark."
"Good, but v crowded and this wasn't summer. Go early and try to beat the crowds. The whole place could do with a dust and a sweep. The gift shop at the end of the city near the gardens has some good quality souvenirs."
"This place is massive with many large and ancient buildings, Dating back to the 14th century and the home of the Emperors of China. Quite basic really for a palace although the massive chinese buildings deserve a visit."
"The Buildings & life styles of the Emperors are unbelievable, well preserved & a wonderful tourist attraction."
"Huge, I mean huge attraction takes you back to the Ming Dynasty as you explore each section to marvel at the stunning architecture, palaces, artwork, bronze work, pottery, you name it. Sure, it's crowded but it's worth the visit."
"We were in Beijing in April 2013...Of all that we saw, the Forbidden city was the most hyped about and least interesting !!...except for walking a huge distance the structure evoked little excitement & Interest...at best the Entry tickets price was a Forbidden cost !!"
"This is the second time I have been there, and it still amazes me. They were fixing some of the buildings and it was crowded but still well worth the time to see."
"This palace is very very very big and crowded also, even on weekdays. We visited for almost 2 hours. A lot of things to see. A must visit place if you go to Beijing. Entrance fee was quite expensive though."
"I loved seeing it, but don't spend too much time looking for information about what is in Forbidden City - really lacks good signage."
"When visiting Beijing, it is a given that you will go to the Forbidden City; however, I was let down by the experience. The size of the compound is impressive and the architecture is grand. The restoration and the painting is not well done. What a shame. You were not able to enter any of the buildings, just look inside. Not a problem, but you can tell the artifacts have not be taken care of. They are dusty and textiles are sun damaged. Generally it is not very clean.

The Hall of Supreme Harmony was closed for renovation. That could not be avoided because of our timing. It was interesting to see all the workers on top of the building working.

We did spend about three hours walking and photographing with hundreds of other visitors. Stopped for rest and water in the Imperial Garden with just about everyone else.

I would go again if I was with someone who had not been there before, but I felt the experience was disappointing overall."
"That one word describes it all. Over 100 acres right in the centre of Beijing! Huge restoration has resulted in a wonderful example of chinese history. Excellent signage detailing what the buildings were used for and the history of the place.
A must see and allowa full day!"
Everytime I visit I learn some new secret about the place. This is a MUST see if you are in Beijing! And give yourself plenty of time to get through it all!
"I was most impressed with the scale of the Forbidden City which you do not appreciate from website photos. As with all sightseeing I've done in China, I had a guide lead a tour which is well worth it to gent an explanation of the history of the Forbidden City, learn about who lived where, who build what and get a flavor for what the dynamics might have been at the time."
"Absolutely amazing that this belonged to just one person. It is a huge complex and just when you think you have come to the center, there is yet another gate. It involves a LOT of walking and becomes so overwhelming that it really should be seen in two visits. I would recommend this to anyone, however for a glimpse into China's past."
"Actual visit date, October 2008. There are several courtyards and small museums in the Forbidden City and it would take hours to see them. Unfortunately most of the big rooms of the emperor had glass protecting them from the tourist. You could not see into them because there was little or no lighting."
Takes a lot of time to view the entire place ... best to be visited on a weekday ... we went on a weekend and it was jam packed with tourists! but very interesting artefacts and a must visit place in Beijing!
"I will definitely be coming back here!!!
The entrance fee is very cheap and you can spend the WHOLE day exploring this Palace, so it is well worth the money.
There were also audio-guides available... Kind of worth getting, although the details given are very brief and cuts out sometimes, i'm bilingual (Cantonese and English) but I opted for the English guide, and compared to my sister who went for the Cantonese guide, mine gave a lot less info and didn't speak in areas where my sisters guide was still working.
The Forbidden City is absolutely Beautiful, but I would say be careful if you go with little children because they will get trampled on! You really do have to fight your way to see the main parts e.g. the Throne.

I love the Forbidden City but I wish I was born 1 or 2 decades earlier because now, most of the Palace is exhibitions and gift shops :| rather than preserving how the Palace would have looked before. Also, a lot of places were closed off, but it was really cool to look into the gaps and get a glimpse of the past!

I would recommend that people arrive REALLLLLYYY early in order to make good use of the day, because the Forbidden City is VERY large, I think I arrived about 10am and left about 5/6? and still didn't manage to see everything.

Also, I would recommend going to the park behind the Forbidden city, the view is AMAZING and you can try out Qing dynsaty outfits for cheap!! again, the view of the Forbidden City from the park is AMAZING!!!

I would definitely visit the Forbidden City again, and again and again! I love it."
It was a public holiday when we visited - an extra 5 million people into Beijing! It was fascinating though and somewhere I have wanted to go to especially since watching the Last Emperor.
"Very surprising to finally see this, you walk in and WOW. We were only there for a few hours and you could easily spend days looking round. Got a taste of what it was like and definitely on the to revisit list if we ever get back to Beijing.

Everyone who has been will tell you to spend the day there at minimum, but you can walk through the city in about 2 or 3 hours and get a glimpse of what it is like."
"Huge palace and probably beats all palaces in the whole of Asia. Never to be missed when in Beijing. Be prepared to walk & tons of ppl visiting each day hence better to go either v early or v late. Tickets can be purchased at the entrance, no need to book in advance.

If you have a tripod for ur camera, bring it! you will need it when trying to squeeze to take pictures of the various halls.

Give yourself ample time and forget it if you have only an hour to spare cos it'll take a few hours.

Souvenir shops at the back have many interesting items to buy as momentos."
"A couple hours was enough for us at this site. There are hordes of people all crowding around each of the buildings, which makes it difficult to take pictures. Bring an umbrella for keeping off the sun, as well as the rain!"
"This was the second time I visited this magnificent structure.The first time I didn't use a guide, and I missed many of the nuances that a real life guide can provide. It is hard to imagine six thousand servants, concubines, guards, cooks and state officials lived here to service one individual, the emperor. The facility is huge, probably 200 acres (my estimate.) The palace has 8, 500 rooms (officially) but our guide said the legend was 9,999 1/2 rooms, 1/2 of a room below the perfect ""palace"" in heaven which has 10,000 rooms. Our guide was also careful to point out that the last 30 years of palace history was dominated by Dowager Empress Tzu Hsi, aka, ""The Dragon Lady."" The former concubine was the mother and aunt of the last two emperors, and was the real ruling power in China in the last years before the revolution. The walk through the palace is easy. Get there early, and avoid weekends if possible. Most of the visitors are from other parts of China on a school outing, or some other group from a common city or organization. Most of them have never been to the Palace before. When you consider that some 20,000 Chinese visit each day and that it would take almost 200 years for all residents of China to visit the great Palace, it accentuates of the vastness of this great country. It also underscores the great power of one man, the emperor, born to rule this vast country. The buildings, grounds, and especially the spectacular gardens at the end of the tour are fitting symbols of this great power."
"The Imperial Palace (Forbidden City) is a place I have always wanted to visit since I read about it as a child and saw the movie ""The Last Emperor"". Visiting it was certainly a dream come true and I left with a greater impression of it's grandeur than I had before (meaning I was not disappointed). The compound is well preserved with so much to see that one cannot do it all in a day.

Be prepared for lots of walking on stone surfaces. The less historically inclined might want to limit themselves to the main courtyard, the hall of supreme harmony (throne room) and maybe the imperial garden. But, if you can, try exploring it all - you will get an idea of how massive this place is.

Generally lots of tourists, including Chinese tourists who, like you, would be making a once-in-a-lifetime visit to place beyond your imagination. However, if you linger until closing time, one can get a moment or two for photos with nobody in the background! Makes for truly awesome photos!"
"Nice to see one of the last real chinese achitectur. Better to do it with a guide if you can in order to get some ""unexpected"" info!"
"The only way to really experience and feel the importance and magnitude of the Forbidden City is to go there. One's mind is instantly transported to the past. Watch the movie the Last Emperor before going to make this historical visit more meaningful. The only inconvenience are the very large and loud crowds. But even so, it's worthwhile."
"Having visited lots of temples and sites in China we thought the Forbidden City would be just another one. We were wrong just the best-the exhibitions were amazing with beautiful ceramics. The actual imperial gardens located towards the back of the site have an unusual system to deal with the crowds and if you enter to either the left or right access points you can only walk through that half. It is worth doing a circuit so you can walk through both sides of the courtyard. This site is incredibly busy and when we arrived at 8.30 am huge tour groups were already queuing in the central courtyard. You queue buy your ticket, queue to get in, queue to visit the gardens and queue to get out so wear comfy shoes. Allow at least 4 hours for your visit."
"I found it really difficult to take in the scale of this place. It really is a city within a city and demonstrates the awesome power that the emperors wielded. How can one man own all that?( I start to discern where the penchant for communism came from!) The buildings are fascinating, colourful and impressive. Not too crowded when we visited and only a little of the inevitable scaffolding. A must-see for anyone visiting Beijing."
"Forbidden City does not require any advertising !!!. It is a must to see - Full Stop !!!. It has been well renovated and it is untouched in its original form. The site is large, so be prepared to spend a solid 3 - 4 hours walking around many buildings. Be sure to have a good guide, to navigate you."
"Well you can't go to Beijing without going here. It takes a while and after 30 minutes everything looks the same, but there are some hair on the back of your neck moments when you ascend stairs and enter the large courtyards."
"I think we had the most opportune time to have visited forbidden city on spring time where winds were cold amidst the scorching heat of the sun. We didnt need a tour guide, we just rented an Automatic Guide for Y40 with no deposit. It also helped that we studied both Asian and World history in high school as it somehow gave us a much better understanding of what we were seeing."
"The forbidden city is massive constructed structure, really massive. There is lot of significance of the forbidden city amongst the locals as we heard that the real estate prices increase as you get closer to the forbidden city since it emits power according to Feng Shui beliefs. The Palace has so much history associated with it and its worth to have a guide to decipher it for you so you get the essence of significance of construction. There are artifacts, relics stored in various halls which are interesting as things like scientific instruments being used in 16th century including astrophysics, geometry, chemistry, they all are on display. Be prepared for a walk of atleast 3 hours inside. There is a local map available for 10RMD, make sure you purchase that incase you are not with a guide as you easily can skip many things unknowingly. Its on line 1 of the subway and you can Tinamen East or West station."
"Unfortunately every time I go, most of the buildings are closed. It is impressive due to its size and a n amazing sight to behold. Try to stay away from the pushing and shoving Chinese tour groups. They yell into their microphones and disrupt what could be a wonderful experience.

My opinion, walk through. Start at Tiananmen square for historical perspective. Go under the busy road and go in at the south gate entrance. Walk through taking it all in. The cool stuff to see will be blocked by 100's and 100's of people trying to cram into one spot and shoving cameras in front of your face if you do get a chance to glance inside. Walk out the north gate. When you hit the street, walk a few paces down the sidewalk to your right, and go under the road. DO pay to go into this garden. It is very cheap, very beautiful AND not very busy. Walk to the top of the hill and look out over the Forbidden City. Beautiful view!"
"If you have seen the movie, ten you will probably appreciate this location even more. It is a large sprawling site with a lot of interesting structure to view many with their interiors preserved and viewable from behind glass."
A really enjoyable trip to an interesting site. We were grateful to Carla our guide for explaining it all to us.
"The scale of Chinese undertakings is difficult to conceive/believe until you've seen it firsthand. The Forbidden City, like just about everything else in China, is on a scale almost unknown to the west. It covers hectares and has layer upon layer. The buildings are impressive, although surprisingly dilapidated. While there is a program of works underway, I was surprised to see so much peeling and faded paint. The buildings would have been so breathtakingly beautiful in their prime, but of course I would not have been able to see them then, as commoners were forbidden from entering the palace grounds (hence the name!) - I would have been shot on sight (with an arrow - a horrible way to go). The tour guides take great delight in telling you one of the emperors had 3000 concubines - apparently westerners are obsessed with this fact! My favourite part was at the northern end - the gardens where the concubines entertained the emperor has some very ancient trees and rock formations and you can just imagine the ladies and men in their exquisitely embroidered silks walking the gardens while music played and food/tea was brought by myriad servants (who traversed the huge grounds through underground tunnels). The place is very evocative and is the cultural heart of contemporary China. A must-visit destination."
"We were very fortunate when we visited the Forbidden City because the temperature was -15 C and there were very few people around. This allowed us to experience the whole complex without the teeming crowds which are said to inhabit in good weather.

The Forbidden City is a very interesting attraction and with a good guide, gives a very good insight as to how the Emperor and senior members of the government lived in those times. The complex is much larger than I imagined but is easy to take it all in."
"The size.
The number of rooms and gardens.
The little details you may miss if you don’t have a guide with you.
All this, justifies a carful plan or taking a guide with you.

On the other hand, We didn’t like the poor way the government allows tourists ( mainly locals and foreigners of course) to see the internal parts of the deferent rooms – you cannot see most of the items because you need to stick your nose from the outside to a dirty glass and when you finely succeed to look inside you see a few items that look dusty with not a single word of explanation in any language ( not even Chinese!)"
Visited the Forbidden City as part of a tour with Catherine Lu Tours. Our tour guide Jenny was amazingly knowledgeable of the Forbidden City and gave us so much information of the history of this amazing location. The vastness of it is completely mind blowing.
"Took forever to find the entrance. People don't seem to know, they just send you around in circles. No real directions to entrance. Most temples closed. Can see only outside. A couple that were open had a couple of pieces of furniture. I've had enough of temples."
This is a good attraction but not for people who cannot walk for long distances and with steps at many places with no wheelchair access.
Seeing this puts into perspective how young our country is. Best seen over several visits. Far too much to see in one day. Forget about personal space. Always crowded.
"Was an incredible experience to stayed there, the city is extremedly clean and organized, the picture inside are amazing is easy to imagine all around....really this plece is unforgetable."
It was very hard to see some of the indoor attractions due to the hoards of people pushing and shoving. However it is a must see
"one of the most impressive imperial palaces in the world. Minimum visiting time 2 hours. You might hire one of the many guides at the entrance: they do not charge much and they will give a lot of interesting comments up to a certain point. For real in depth informations you have to check the books, these guides are more amateurs. They guides have a special entrance permit; so you do not have to buy a ticket for them."
"Very glad to get this one off the list. One would be foolish to skip the centerpiece of Beijing while visiting, but the throngs of people, literally elbow to elbow, and the scam artists approaching you every few minutes can be off-putting.

No sense in rehashing the historical significance of the place, so here is what I saw: Breathtaking architecture, gigantic buildings sprawling over multiple city blocks. I bought the audio tour, which is supposed to start automatically and explain the significance of each building- unfortunately, my audio player liked to speak to me in Korean or Japanese with no warning, and it took me minutes to figure out how to reset it. Often, it didn't speak at all.

I enjoyed a few minutes of daydreaming about the emperors who lived here, but these few moments of peace were often interrupted by the sheer number of people in every corner, or the fact that you will find yourself opening your wallet many more times to enter some of the other exhibitions inside (like the Clock and watch exhibit) to pay another few dollars to gain entry.

Unfortunately, a lot of visitors litter, both here at a national landmark, and in other Chinese cities I've visited. That's unfortunate. At the back of the fortress, you will find a covered traditional seating area where water flows in- most likely from one of the nearby lakes. The water was riddled with discarded water bottles and other trash. I couldn't imagine discarding trash so carelessly at such an important cultural location.

When it was over, I got some great pictures, saw some amazing sites, and managed to get through the crowds. Well worth it to mark the ""Forbidden City"" off the list."
This is an impressive and imperial place with three great ceremonial halls and three principal palaces. A visit here provides a glimpse into the extravagant living quarters that housed 34 successive emperors. Plan to do a lot of walking and photo taking and consider having lunch at the nearby restaurant.
"As most of the attractions in China, they are best enjoyed with a good guide and we recommend Travel China Guide. The guides are so well versed on the history and the meaning of the various buildings and structures that one would miss too much without them."
It's part of history and should be seen. Make sure you use the guide otherwise you don't really know what you're looking at as most rooms look pretty much the same
"Despite the tsunami of people, the 'Old Palace' is an unmissable experience. And as you get into its farther reaches, the tsunami tends to dissipate. The famous views are breathtaking and you can spend a day wandering around the labyrinth of pavilions, gates and buildings, always picking out a new detail, getting a different visual perspective."
Nothing prepares you for the scale and opulence of the Forbidden City. There's just too much to take in. It was busy on the Saturday we were there and we had to jostle with the crowds to see into the pavilions through the windows as most of them are closed.
"The Forbidden City is a must take for everyone going to Beijing. The color of the buildings and majesty of the area is unsurpassed. A late afternoon, they close around 5, is best as most of the tours have left by then. Coming in around 3:30, you have to be in before 4, gave us some of the best pictures without people around some of the buildings."
"English speaking guides are available there. They asked for 600 Yuan for 3 hours. I found it's costly, so I rent an audio guide for 40 Yuan and it's useful and cheap too.

I've been watching The last Emperor for decades and realized how huge the palace is. This time there're so many people in front of the main gate, but once getting inside it's very less people, comparing with the size of the place. My goodness, once passing the main gate I faced the palace and really impressed by its size and its architecture.

I actually planned for half day walk as recommended by the hotel, but I end up spent my whole day in Forbidden city. Everything worth spending and walking. Prepare time and comfort shoes. Food in side is not expensive and taste ok.

For other parts that you have to pay extra, if money and time is not your issue, I would recommend you should spend time there too. Like the clock: I myself 've never seen those beautiful and complicate clocks made from England, France, and some other parts of the world like that before. Those are not regular clocks you've ever seen-never ever. Lucky enough that they have VDO to show how each clock work and that's really impressive- touching. Also the other parts that you have to pay extra contains 9 dragons on the wall. it's beautiful and show the skill of the worker who do the painting of wood and terracotta.

I and my family paid for all extra to explore other parts and those worth paying.

WOULD RECOMMEND!!!!"
"Fairly easy to get to this location after coming from Tiantan Park by subway. Understandably crowded. Could see people congregating across the street at the nearby Tiananmen Square. Lots of police visibility and they were randomly stopping single males walking by, asking for IDs.

We didn't have time to get inside the actual palace so we just took a lot of photos in front outside by the photo of Chairman Mao."
"Local scam artists working with backstreet tea houses are scamming foreign Solo travelers. They meet up coming out of the Subway in front of the park entrance next to the forbidden city entrance. They state they are on holiday, and you are from USA, Canada, Russia etc. they ask to join you so as to practice their english, or whatever. They say go in park entrance main entrance way to packed. You go thru park in about 30 minutes, then they say lets get tea. They order green tea, flower tea, some snacks, then later, some local red wine(That ends up being 1000yuan or about $150 usd. Then they say you pay, usually $1800~2000 yuan for 4. I confirmed with a few local regulars, and said this is becoming a common practice. I stated, When we have Factory dinners at nice restaurants, with mgt, engineering, sales, and guests 8~10 people with drinks it is that much. They state, well this is bar, it is more expensive.
Beware!!
Also, in train station, a baggage handler, wil charge you 100Yuan to roll your luggage 200mtrs to subway, but not tell you upfront. Just dont let them grab you bags."
"We visited the Forbidden City on a Saturday so there were many tour groups but once you are the past the ticket lines and the first few buildings, the grounds are so large that you don't notice the crowds.

Be prepared to walk: we spent 3 hours at the Forbidden City and were only able to see a little more than half the grounds.

We didn't use the audio guide but purchased a map from a vendor for about 6RMB- it was worth the minimal expense.

If you really want more information and want a more indepth history of the buildings, then you may want to hire a guide or use the audio tour."
"The Forbidden City is awesome! It's BIG. You enter at a South gate and exit in the North. About the time you assume you've covered about a third of the distance you realize you haven't even reached the southern entrance yet! It's maintained well, not in a theme park way. Plan on LOTS of walking!! It's worth it. Seeing it as part of a day tour helps."
"This is one of those places you have to go, just to say you've been. The glory of it is it's sheer magnitude, you have no idea how large it is until you start walking. It is very crowded and to see inside some of the buildings ( most of the main buildings you can only look into, not go in) feels a little like a Chinese mosh pit. Everyone is trying to see through a relatively small opening and take pictures etc. That being said it is an experience worth doing. Northern end of the complex has lovely gardens and the crowds seem to thin out slightly by that end. All the buildings with other exhibits require a separate add on ticket. Be warned only one line at the ticket booth takes credit."
A huge group of buildings which need explanation as to the history and significants of the buildings. Good to see upgrading to the buildings .
"The place is huge and very crowded. Rented audio guide which is GPS based but not always accurate so become confusing. Were not able to see anything inside the building as there were always many people in front of the windows to look into the building. Most buildings were renovated, look newly painted and ended up all buildings looked pretty much the same."
We loved experiencing the Forbidden City and seeing all of its splendor and charm. It's a lot of walking so be sure to wear comfortable shoes!
After 2 very long days previously walking through the Summer Palace and the Temple of Heaven Parks we were relieved to find the Forbidden Palace was much more compact and easy to navigate in a few hours. Very touristy with souvenir/coffee shops a plenty to sit down for a rest and catch up on the last minute gifts. We went across the road towards the back of the Palace where we climbed up to the magnificent view from a temple and took breathtaking photos of the Palace grounds and Beijing. We did the entire touristy thing and even dressed up in Royal gowns for photos for the usual inflated prices. We preferred this rather than the other two attractions purely for the overall historical significance.
The Forbidden City was a great surprise for me. I had no idea the number if courtyards tht led up to the Imperial Palace. Fascinating cultural experience.
"First I came to Forbidden City in 2006, we can enter through north Entrance in front of Jingshan Park, but now we must enter from south in Tiananmen. And beware for the ""trickshaw scam"", as they ask for only 3 yuan to take us to south entrance Forbidden City, but then they will take you to small alley in Hutong area, and when nobody around, they will stop the rickshaw and ask for 300 yuan!

This place is very hugh. And for the ""surprise effect"", I still think that entrance from the north is the best, we go to small alley and see where the royal family do their activity like living room, bedroom, etc. And then after that we can see the real big building of the King's Palace.

If we go from south entrance, then we see big & huge building all the way, and in the end we already get tired & just want to get out.. But after all, this is a MUST SEE attraction when you go to Beijing, one of the biggest palace I see in Asia.."
This place is huge so allow at least 1-2 hours to walk around the place! Good for history buffs and those who love a good photo op.
"A lot of this place was being renovated, but having said that, it is so big it did not matter. I took a large number of photos here. My guide kept rattling off facts and figures which went through one ear and out the other. After a while it just becomes information overload.

I apid an extra 10rmb to go to a garden area of the palace. I was introduced to some other guide there, who told me the nephew of the last emperor was there. The guide showed me a room with a lot of photos which apparently showed the last emperor and his brother. He told me that this nephew was into calligraphy. He took me to him and had him demonstrate the calligraphy that he does.
I was then asked if I would like to have one done. I agreed but I had a naggin feeling that something was not right about this. Anyhow I bought a beautiful scroll with Happiness and Longevity on it with my family name in Chinese with 2 seals stamps put on.

I was sure it was some sort of scam but actually I like the scroll. I probably paid through the nose for it and my guide got some sort of kick back for taking me here but that is the way it goes. I asked my guide twice if that guy was really the nephew. She said it was and I saw the photos.

Later that night at my hotel, I found out that there was only one nephew Aisin Gioro Yuhuan was born﻿ in october 1923 and he died in Beijing 23. June 1997. However the youtube videos I have seen(3) it is the same guy that did mine. So fake or not, it is still pretty special. I also got to see inside some private areas of the palace. So if you do get taken here Caveat emptor."
"This is a very busy place for low season, I'd hate to visit during peak season, so I think we probably chose the best time. It's not as packed and it's still cool and comfortable enough. We passed through two sets gates/tunnels and squares before finally getting to the Meridian Gate. The Meridian Gate is the main entrance to the Forbidden City. I rented an English audio guide that plays a pre recorded message depending on where I am. As part of the audio guide there's a small map with LED lights to show where you are. The Forbidden City is surrounded by a large moat and then high walls. Once inside, there were less people, it was still crowded, but a lot less people than just outside the entrance. We passed through some more gates before getting to the throne room. We could not enter most of the buildings, they main entrance was open for you to look through, but blocked by a fence. At the throne room the people were around 7 deep trying to peer inside. It's a good thing, I'm amongst the taller individuals, I just raised my camera over my head and took a snapshot. Unfortunately it seems in the past, a lot of tourists must have caused damage. Some people had scratched their name on some of the bricks and also the condition of the treasures are deteriorating, they are getting old, and it's only in recent history that people thought they are worth preserving. Even now a lot of people still feel the need to touch or rub certain objects. There's lot to see here, too much to remember and describe, there's 9 dragon wall, gardens, a well where a beautiful princess died.....
When we left the Forbidden city left through the northern gate, we then had to run through a gauntlet of hawkers that blocked the way out, they were offering rides, cabs, souvenirs... They were very aggressive and in your face. We had to push through and ignore them. After making through the hawkers, there several people with physical deformities pan handling. That was the worst part, I felt sympathy for them and wouldn't mind giving them some money, but we were told that these people were being used for the sympathy that they would generate. It was very sad..."
"It was what we had imagined - grand, majestic and enormous, full of history. Even the kids enjoyed it. We went at the end of March so the crowds were not that bad at all."
luxury trophy of the emperor. The gallary holds the greatest and top works-of-art treasures of mankind.
"Unfortunately I did not have enough time to have a look at the entire City. However, what ever little that I got to see really impressed me.

Definitely a must. Do not waste much time at Tiananmen Square"
"One of the best attractions to visit in Beijing. It was snowing on the day I went. Some of the beautiful marble carvings were covered with snow but the snow covered palace is also beautiful. Do budget at least 4 to 6 hours in your itinerary as the palace is huge. Recommend that you get the audio guide at the entrance. It's worth it and the information on the guide is about the same as the audio guide 10 years ago (I visited 10 years ago). Only difference is Roger Moore was the narrator back then.

The house of clocks is particularly interesting but an extra fee is payable at the entrance to the house of clocks"
"It's a fantastic place to go, but incredibly crowded. You do need to adopt Chinese tactics to get to the front at times. The kids struggled with the distances and any disabled person would find it almost impossible."
"Initially the scale is so huge it's completely impressive. However once you've made your way through courtyard after courtyard that all look pretty much the same it starts to get a bit tedious. It is of course a must see, but I much preferred Other attractions in Beijing. If its this or Summer Palace, choose Summer Palace every time."
"Entrance is a little crowded as can be expected...there is your Mao banner there, priceless picture. The grounds are huge, huge. Gives you a good sense of the importance and explains the longevity, homogeneity and control of the country...
It is a walk, the grounds cover 70 hectars +, try and go with a guide so you may be able to get more out of it...explanations on the huge bronze water urns...the small museum, the edifices purposes etc."
"We truly enjoyed this part of our trip. It is one thing to see pictures, but as we learned...pictures could not possibly do this justice. It was so much larger than what we had imagined. Be sure to wear very comfortable walking shoes and be prepared to walk a lot....."
Worth getting a guided tour to explain both the history of the palace and the strict philosophical/religious principles behind just about everything in its construction. I was expecting it to be lavish but it is fairly sparse. I guess a lot of the nice stuff has been plundered. Expect crowds.
we were there at the time of the congress. we were brainwashed westerners and expected the military to be out and security to be a visible presence. We were totally wrong. i was amazed. at the scale of everything and the cleanliness. Not to be missed.mind blowing architecture. and sculptures.of an ancient and sophisticated culture.
"Wonderful, impressive, huge. Just a few words that cannot and will never be able to describe the Forbidden City. Makes you feel small, imagination working full speed. You can imagion 1000's of people standing on that square. You feel so small.
Don't follow the busloads of Chinese people. They take the road right through the centre. Take the sideroads, see the small aleyways. They are much quieter. Better to soak up the atmosphere. Dream away on one of the many benches. And they even have good coffee in the many shops. Ignore the people trying to sell you tours, don't hire a guide at the entrance. Most of the time they don't even know what they are talking about. Hire one of the audioguides.
Enjoy!!"
"We enjoyed walking around in this megalomanic complex. We regretted not having a guide or an audiotour. Without it, it's mostly a bunch of buildings very alike... The history of this place is simply impressive, it breaths the amount of power these emperors had!

Take a good day. Even if it is not your cup of tea, the place is huge and you have to walk a fair bit!"
"The significance of this is that it ended the imperialism of China and is related to the last emperor...together with the Wall and Terracotta Warriors, all makes sense and personally was enough history for me. I should add that we were only 2 and had a private guide on each visit which could share history beyond that of only the site which we were visiting. The Forbidden City disappointed me ito maintenance. It is huge. A guide is essential...don't go with a group. Allow lots of time. The sad thing about China is that they have so much ito heritage, but somehow I got the impression that they don't have a sense of belonging-they don't seem passionate about preserving what belongs to one of the 4 oldest civilisations in the world."
"This is a must, but i am just sorry that we did not have enougfh time to get round all of it. we done the great wall and the palace in once day and although we had long enough at the wall, the palace was a bit rushed. Make sure you have a good guide, the one we had must have been too many times and just had no interest at all."
This is a fantastic complex of palaces temples and massive buildings. Avoid at weekends as it is swamped by chinese tourists who come from all over to see their capital city and its treasures. The lines can be massive so try to pick a quiet time and enjoy the sights here.
"Being the number 1 thing to do in Beijing, it is extremely touristy. The treasure gallery area was the best part but we had to buy an extra ticket for it. Do not skip it if you have already bought a ticket to Forbidden city."
"Hire a tour guide to better appreciate the place. It's huge. There are lots of buildings, one to store their money, one for their jewelry etc. There are also houses for the emperor's concubines! A different world in a different time."
"Forbidden City is everything we thought it would be: massive, beautiful, full of history. We did not choose our visit time well and headed there on probably one of the busiest afternoons we could have chosen, during a national holidays. The queue to the tickets was frustrating, but not longer than about 30-40 minutes, so would be much less when half the China is not in Beijing. We were also entitled to a massive student discount which made up for the wait. There were hoardes of people everywhere and as for trying to get a look into the halls and pavilions, only if you were prepared to get snug with the crowd and work your elbows. After a while, I must gets a little boring: the squares, buildings, gates and courtyards all look the same, but then you find yourself in the garden and all is well with the world, if you can find a corner to enjoy it from that is"
"I almost gave up when I saw the extreme queues in front of the ticket booth on Saturday noon. But the queues where efficient, and people behaved nice, with no cutting in line. And the wait was absolutely worth it. The forbidden city is overwhelming and spectacular .I recommend getting a map, or using tripadvisor offline guide for iPhone. The guide gave me a lot of great info and helped getting around."
"The Forbidden City is well worth visiting insofar as it presents one with so many photographic opportunities and a variety of things to do. There is as much to see by just walking through the courtyards as there is when visiting the many museums along the way. There are a number of options should you require a guided tour, such as those who will offer their services at a cost, or there is the option of using a multi-lingual electronic device. One thing to remember en-route is that ""a one-way system"" operates there, that is, you can not back track and exit through the gate which you entered. Instead, you will exist at the opposite end of the ""city"" and walk back round the perimeter wall if you so choose, back to the front entrance. In doing so, you will pass an array of little food establishments and small grocery stores. There are other transport options, such as Taxi and Rickshaw. The Forbidden City is a ""walking experience"" and not suitable for the very young or infirm as the ground is somewhat uneven. It is however perfectly ""stroller-friendly"". If I have any regrets about my visit there, it is just that I had too little time there. I think one should allocate at least three to four hours to properly experience the wonder of it all."
"A very interesting, beautiful remarkable place. We took the MTR subway to the site. My 2 kids aged 10 & 6 rated this attraction the worst unfortunately because it was the busiest historical site we had ever visited (March 2013). There were many tour groups and lots of walking. When we got to the end we had to take a pedicab back to the MTR station which cost us 30RMB per person. The crazy driver gave us a detour thru the hutongs too."
"Gives you the sense of imperial china. The power, grandeur and the intrigues.Even though it was packed with local and international tourists ,you could loose yourself to thoughts of old china and the royals and the intrigues of the glorious past that shaped this huge great country. . beautiful porcelain and Furniture ."
"This place was huge, no joke, need to prepare good condition go visit here.
But bring maps before enter it, there were no free maps available, unless you want to buy maps from local people, or rent self audio. Brings food and water, also hat and umbrella.

One of the greatest palace must see, in this word. The building was absolutely amazing, just walk till the end of the palace, there were small beautiful garden. Also there were almost 200 years old tree there.
In the middle of the palace, there were small museum, you can see old jade, war equipment, ancient things."
You can not have imagined how large this place is from the entrance. Visiting on a national holiday made the place packed but still amazing to see the size of the area and Palace. We visited the treasure museum and that area was not as crowed and very peaceful.
"I am not sure I have ever seen so many tour groups in one area in all my life. We saw the entire spectrum of the rainbow in the many colors of hats the different groups were wearing. The Forbidden City was truly a remarkable sight. Take your time and learn of the era and the different buildings. That makes it much more worthwhile. I am not sure many tourists will elect not to see the Forbidden City, and I now understand why."
"One of the places that HAD to be seen, so we went. We were told that the regular entrance was closed (after we got there) and we had to walk around to the Wumen gate.
For its sheer size its quite impressive, and if you read up on what you're about to see or maybe hire a guide..it will be way more interesting.
With the amount of people pushing and shoving to take pictures, we could barely see what was inside the halls. And from the exterior its just hall after hall which look similar from outside.
The garden are was nice, the trees are beautiful. But I went to the Lama Temple later in the day and I saw similar architecture and it was a way more satisfying experience."
A must see in Beijing and China in general. This place is always pack with tourist from other parts of China and other countries. Make sure you bring a camera with you and your walking shoes! A long walk with lots of cool things to look at. Def set a side a few hours to view this palace.
A huge place with 9999. Nine being an auspicious number. The 3 major buildings stand in a straight line on the north/south axis of the City. Each is used for different purposes and 2 have magnificent thrones. The temple of Supreme Harmony is difficult to see for the crowds. The meditations area and Emperors/Concubines rooms are a must.
"We toured the Forbidden City with my daughters High School as part of a school trip. Even during the week it was very, very busy and you could get lost quite easily. As we were with a tour group, we didn't have as much time at the city as we would've liked, but made the best of what time we did. Bathrooms were clean here, but we only found chinese bathrooms, no western facilities. No biggie for us, but some in our group were not happy about this."
"The Forbidden City is an incredible and interesting site to visit but it is huge and the layout complex, so it is well worth arranging a guide in advance to explain everything, avoid the queues / crowds, navigate the place and show you the best views. Gives a great sense of Chinese history and culture."
"Magnificent palace, huge area, count on at least 3 hours walking around. Very crowded with people, we visited on Saturday 11AM-3 PM, probably the worst hours of the week. Good information on signs available, but you need guide book with map to look at when walking around. Very few westerns when we visited, 99,9% chinese tourists which adds to experience."
take line 1 to tian' anmen east or west.big place and would tke you half a day if you really serious about walking around the palace.
You may have wondered why they call the iconic building we see in National Geographic and other travel magazines the Forbidden CITY. It's because that is just one of almost 1000 buildings surrounded by high walls. You can spend all day exploring here. Be sure to wear good shoes and watch where you step to avoid twisted ankles. Not to be missed.
excellent sight in the heart of beijing!!don;t miss it. it gets very crowded so go early..you need to spend at least 3 hours inside!
"I wouldn't believe it, but the size of this monument is amazing !
To really do it well, you need at least 2 days ... i have done it in 4 hours ! just to cross from 1 part to the other and back, no time for little ways on the back, little houses .... but so many beautiful things
walking there, you can imagine how was life there ... and it is not so far ..."
"We visited on a day when there seemed to be millions of us trying to enter all at the same time. Of course it wasn't millions but it was very busy and at times a little scary as we tried to wend our way through the large pushing and shoving crowd. It was so busy we couldn't get near to looking into the throne building or at least I couldn't, too short and not pushy enough I guess. It is an interesting place and as you move away from the main entrance area and into many of the other areas, the crowds thin and you see more of the very large complex. You can't enter any of the buildings but you do get a glimpse of life by looking into windows and doorways.
If you are claustrophobic it might be a tough place to visit as I suspect the crowds are always pretty large."
"This is one place that you should definitely visit while in China. The buildings are stunning and the scale of the place is breathtaking.

Needs a whole day to appreciate the vast complex. Try to get some knowledge about the place before you visit. Makes it a whole lot more interesting.

Brilliant."
"We visited this palace by Mac 2013.The weather is nice so it was an wonderful trip.Don't come by Monday because now they only operated until 12 pm on Monday because they need to do some maintenance works. I found out after I purchase the tickets.Adult cost RMB40 and children cost RMB25 if I am not mistaken.They just put the signboard away from counter instead of putting in front of Ticket counter.So make sure to look around to make sure they are not closed early before you purchase the tickets. Although I felt a little angry however I have to admitted this is a wonderful place for me to understand my ancestors' mother country history.We were managed to visit some main building,however...so I intend to come again in the future,but never on Monday."
"I love forbidden city, a great place to visit. Normally is very crowded but this doesn't bother me so much.

If visiting in winter it is amazing to visit in a snowy day"
"To be honest I was a bit disappointed by many parts of the Forbidden City. It's very beautiful to see it from above (from the park nearby), but inside there is just not so much to see. I didn't like the palace interiors very much, and it was way to busy in front of the entrances, so it was more like pushing your way through to take a picture and leave again. Also I thought many parts are too much renovated looking.. It's like newly built... I liked some other parts, where it was a bit quieter and less renovated, so that you could really see how it used to be!"
"OK, so here is my take. Being a bit of a girthy American male, I had a blast using my bulk to manuever among the chinese to get great shots at the various temples about the place. We happened to be there during the ""Tomb Sweeping Day"" national holiday, so it was packed. The only way to get close to a good picture was to worm your way to the front. Being bigger, heavier, and taller than just about everyone was quite an advantage. As you push through the Chinese sorta just go with it. Fun..."
I think this was amazing to see but it was crazy trying to take photos. It was like a pop concert pushing and shoving to get to the front. I also thought it looked rather sad and not looked after very well.
"The architecture is magnificent and the explanatory boards are clear. However you can't enter any buildings to look at the furniture etc, and the windows could do with a clean. Some of the exhibits inside look a bit neglected, and their significance isn't explained.

When I read the TA reviews I was surprised this attraction got a relatively low rating, but I can see why now."
"Went there on a sunny Saturday. Wow, huge crowds. Surprisingly the line at the ticket booth moved quickly.

The Forbidden City impresses by it's size. You have to pass through different huge courtyards until you get to the main palace. As the place was so packed, it was difficult to peek into the different buildings. Although the complex expresses a certain grandeur in it's own way, I didn't find it particularly nice. I couldn't escape the feeling that this was kind of a large luxury prison. Or maybe I just watched The Last Emperor too often.

Nevertheless, the Forbidden City certainly is one of the Must Do's on a Beijing visit, but mainly due to it's historical significance. For sheer beauty and wow effects, there are better places in Beijing.

One advice - as hinted in other reviews, if you are visiting the place on your own, beware that there is a lot of walking to do. You not only have to walk through the Forbidden City itself, but also walk back around the city to catch a taxi, as there is virtually no chance of getting any transportation directly at the exit."
Not a whole lot more can be said that hasn't already been said. This is obviously a must see in Beijing and definitely should not be missed. I would avoid visiting on a week-end since there are so many people visiting from outside Beijing on week-ends. We went on a Monday which had much less people. If going on a Monday make sure you go at the opening time since recently they have changed the closing times. They now close at noon on Mondays which is worth noting if you plan on trying to see everything.
"Right across from Tian'anmen Square and adorned by a very prominent portrait of former Chairman Mao, long lines lead you into the ticket area and ""security check"" -- most visitors have to put their purses/ bags through the airport-style xray, but guards pretty much waive Western-looking people through. The mass of the Emeror's buildings and grand courtyard-after-courtyard are immense. The home of 24 emperors, including the child ""last emperor"" deposed in 1908 , is a series of multiple buildings ( none of which are open, but a few can be viewed through open doors/ windows). Most impressive are the vast open spaces/courtyards and lion bronzes and other animals. Takes well over an hour to walk straight through, but with stops, about 2."
This is much bigger than you would think and we had to keep going at a reasonable pace just to get all the way through in an hour. There was not much time to look inside the buildings but from what we saw you could only look through doors and windows. we did not find any buildings that you actually went into. That said its a must if you are in Beijing and with moretime we might have found it more inspiring.
"Forbidden city is huge and impressive! But to really appreciate it, you need a good guide who will explain the history behind this landmark."
"what a waste of my time!!!! 2 hours I will never ever get back, walking through courtyard after courtyard after courtyard. None of the buildings are open. Nice artwork but ughhhhh would not bother. Go on a river cruise instead you will see just as much, and Tie ne men square is far better!!!!!!"
"Being in Beijing, a must see is the Forbidden City. It was just amazing and it is a true treasure of human kind."
"A lot more crowded than I imagined (which means that you don't really get good pictures) but very impressive, given how old it is. Some of the walls, doors, ceilings, statues, urns, carvings, trees (the list is endless) are fascinating in their workmanship and detail. Well worth a morning."
"Forbidden City is one of places that i really want to visit.
It is really a huge museum with original artifacts. It tells the history of China and concept behind its architecture.

but too bad, too many tourists so i couldnt enjoy the feel of the place. Also, it lacks of tourist directions. After i exited the forbidden city, i was lost. I didnt know where to go and how. So, i decided to walk back to the main gate and it took 30 mins walk. After that i visited the Mao's mausoleum which is located across the Forbidden City"
"Excellent and mind boggling by the size of it. All tourists to Beijing must see the palace. I believe some of it is being restored and visitors can soon see the rooms as they once were but this was not available when we visited. Neverheless, it was a great experience and one I can definitely recommend."
"We visited on a Tuesday morning when the Forbidden Palace was humming with lots of tour groups. Tickets are 40 Yuans each and it was breeze to buy them at the ticket office (perhaps because we went fairly early -- at 8:30 AM). We walked around on our own from one courtyard to the next, reading signs here and there. It's an amazing experience and worth visiting at least once. After returning from the trip, we watched ""The Last Emperor"" again, just to see the Imperial Palace and recognize various parts."
You should have around 3 hours if you want to go through it all in detail. The place is massive and there are many people and tour groups which will slow things down. Take an audio guide if you want more information. These are better than most 'live guides' approaching you...
"was not expecting this to be so big. very impressive, you could spend all day wandering around and exploring. very busy place"
"I learned on my trip to China that is was good to be the Emperor. Nobody could enter here without his express permission and then some never got to leave. Be careful taking the picture of Chairman Mao, the guards didn't want to let me stop to take the picture, but i don't speak much Chinese so i took it anyway. Learned later they will confiscate your camera? But it is one of those pictures you must take. Inside the city, the ground is very uneven, the pavers have had lots and lots of wear, and you could easily spend the better part of a day in here. Lot's of people, and like the rest of China, lot's of shoving. It also has a four star restroom."
We went to the Forbidden City on a slow day. According to our guide. Us and at least 2million other folks. For people with disabilities it would be very difficult to get around. The pavers are very uneven and steps are numerous. Interesting sight to see hard to believe that one man had so much wealth and power while those around him starved. It was fun for my husband and i as we became the tourist attraction people were rushing over to us to get their picture taken. Made us both laugh. I guess there aren't too many blondes in Beijing.
"When I went it was very cold and very busy. The new audio guide is not very good - the GPS system doesn't work well and they aren't interesting. The buildings are all very similar and their history is not well explained. They are doing a lot of restoration, but a lot more is clearly necessary. The best bit is the gardens right at the end, they were loverly. To be honest I probably wouldn't go again, I much preferred the summer palace where you see examples of the same architecture plus a lot more in a quiet and scenic park for the same price."
"We took the subway to Tiananmen Square and then walked through the square towards the Forbidden City. Although there were literally thousands of tourists, it is such an enormous place one didn't feel overwhelmed. I would suggest going as early as possible, however. There is also an optional entry into cultural museums. I think it was an extra RMB15pp but it was so worth while as many of the tour groups don't venture into that part- and it was really lovely.
Practical tips:
- take food and drinks as there aren't many eating options within the palace.
- set aside a number of hours to really enjoy all that there is on offer
- Exit through the North Gate and then cross the road into Jingshan Park (RMB2 pp and awesome street food available)- from the top of the hill one has an amazing view over the roofs of the Forbidden City, pollution permitting!"
"A must for all travellers, it's a long walk so just make sure you're attired properly especially the footwear. Do make time for this place. A Beijing tour will not be complete without visiting this place!"
"We decided to find a private guide who shared considerable information and history about the Imperial palace that made our tour far more informed and interesting. The palace is amazing and absolutely huge with many of the areas looking similar in nature, so this was great to have to explain what the different areas were used for historically."
"Lots of buildings that are part of the palace ( they all look the same), Not much to see inside them beacause they dont let you in, you can take pictures of the inside from the windows..."
"It was nice to see the forbidden city, but in my eyes, it seems like a lot of open space with not much to see. However, it is a must do for historical purposes."
"just need 1 day or start from 8 or 9 am because it`s big city
:D
and don`t forget just one door for enter and it`s near subway , other door is just for exit ,
just remember that :D coz u need pay taxi or bus for going other side"
"I had only 3 hours to spend inside the Forbidden City - at least a full day is needed, as it's huge!"
"The Forbidden City is a must to see if you are in Beijing. Just when you think you have seen it, there is another section and then another section.
Its recommended to get a map as you just dont realise what is past that ticket gate when you first walk in.
There will be young Chinese women there who will offer to be your tour guide. Not sure what the costs are but if you are in a group of people, maybe worth doing."
"After walking around Beijing and seeing the same style of buildings I was a little disappointed - this was just one courtyard surrounded by the same buildings after another. Obviously most of us want to tick it off the bucket list, but I would just go through the section that is free, then move on."
Second time we have been to the Forbidden City so some of the magic had gone but still enjoyed the experience . Had forgotten just how big is is. It was a little hard to see in some of the rooms as there were so many people trying to peer through the doors but overall was still worth the trip. Wouldn't want to be there in peak holiday season.
"Its a must see attraction in Beijing and it does not disappoint however the designated tour timing and the vast expanse of the attraction do not go hand in hand i.e., make sure you block away at least 1/2 a day to truly appreciate the place at a reasonable pace especially if you are travelling with family."
"We went twice. Firstly, on a Monday we arrived around 10am and like many travelers walk leisurely not realising the inner palace closes at 12. We were not the only ones who were very disappointed that we were ushered out very rudely. BTW theres a tiny notice, very easy to miss indicating this which we only saw the second time around.

That said, we loved the palace, the architecture, the grandeur. Simply a must."
We arrived with about ten thousand others at the main entrance.Go early if you can to beat the crowds.Overwhelmed with the size of the place even though had read about it previously.You must have at least a half day there to get around all the areas.Guide a must to explain the many interesting details of the place.Enjoyed the visit.Wear your walking shoes!
"Have just returned from china, the forbidden city is like a small country !! It is so vast. The buildings are breathtaking so much detail and colour. A lot of walking, you go from one courtyard to another. It amazes me how that many years ago this was built and the majority is still in pristine condition. Well worth visiting"
The highlight is seeing the old clocks operating at 11:00am and 2pm in the Clock and Watch Gallery. .Get there early to get a good vantage spot!
"The incredible attention to detail in all of the buildings and the contents therein is mind-boggling. Very well written explanations outside the buildings were very helpful, as well as a friend who used a smartphone the entire time. We were there five hours and ran out of energy well before we had seen nearly all that is to be experienced. Be sure to take the public transportation to the south end of the City, as this is the entrance side."
"After the first 8-10 buildings, they all started to look alike. Was interesting but I wouldn't plan on spending all day here."
"The Forbidden City is expansive and a bit overwhelming. Get an audio guide and be prepared to do some walking. Some areas are closed as it's undergoing an immense renovation which many areas desperately need. We were amazed by the crowds in early April. The kids enjoyed the garden area in the rear. Bring toilet paper for the ""4 star"" bathrooms."
"Interesting tour of the City with our chinese guide, Angel. Really busy with lots of chinese tourists as well as the rest of us. Didn't realise that this site closes on Monday afternoons so our visit was hurried as we had been to Tiananmen Square first (9.00am). Lots to see and sometimes you queue to get further into the City, but having Angel with us we went straight through.
Lots of walking through the City seeing all the separate buildings/rooms so good, comfy shoes are needed"
If you are in Beijing you have to see the forbidden city! It was an amazing walk...but make sure that you have eaten before you go in. There really wasn't anywhere to eat. We did not go with a tour and I think we covered everything. Give yourself a full day to go through the Palace and the park behind it.
"On a Saturday, the crowds were so dense that it was hard to see anything, and difficult to imagine what it would be like when it was ""forbidden"" and restricted to just a few. I'd suggest going on a weekday if possible, and planning to arrive early and spend most of the day. A tour guide would be best, although if I were going again I'd also read up as much as possible beforehand so as to be less overwhelmed by the sheer magnitude of the place."
"I first viewed the Forbidden City, in May 2011, from a hill in Jingshan Park to the rear of the Forbidden City. From that perspective you can get a sense of the sheer scale of the city that is indeed the size of some compact cities, but completely walled in. Just walking around the exterior of the Forbiddden City is awe-inspiring. It's almost impossible to explore and absorb all aspects of the interior of the City unless you plan to spend an entire day. Many of the structures are repetitive in terms of decorative effects and architecture. There is a quiet park within the compound that costs a few extra yuan to enter, but worth it to observe the City from a different perspective. If you're a history buff or into architecture it's worth getting a tour guide or audio guide to explore the compound. I entered the compound from the rear entrance and worked my way to the front entrance so I exited onto Tiananmen Square and the lrage portrait of Mao facing the square and in front of the entrance to the Forbidden City. I found this was a better way to explore the City because I avoided the masses of tour groups coming through the front entrance, and my exit from the City was dramatic and added a sense of awe to the entire experience."
"Visiting the Forbidden City with Henry from Stretch-A-Leg is a lesson in history and an opportunity to let your mind imagine what it might have been like. Henry will take you through the dynasties as well as show you the different emperors, complete with pictures."
"Quite an interesting visit, its a big city so lots of walking, we had a 2-year old in a stroller, asleep most of the time, and its just not mde for that as so many steps. Worth a visit, but there are better options if you have kids"
It takes 3 hours to do a comprehensive tour of the forbidden cite. It night be best to watch the film The Last Emperor before you go as all the guides assume that you have seen it. Watch out if you are lucky enough on the day of your visit to get to meet the last emperors nephew. its a con job to try to sell you tat.
You are better off doing this with a tour guide as it is so large and you just don't know what you are looking at and which rooms are which as everything is in chinese
"At the end of the forbidden palace, you can pay a little more to see the special treasure exhibit. We didn't know what to expect, and we were really pleased that we paid extra 10 rmb for it.

All the crowds disappeared inside, and you get to see a room up close ( rather than just from outside ) as well as some of the old furniture from the past. Also there are some incredible pieces there made from Jade and gold on exhibit.

To fully understand the opulence of the palace, would really recommend it!"
"My wife and I recently visited Beijing, China. We had 4 days after visiting Shanghai and Hong Kong on a cruise and were advised to find a private guide and driver to make the most of our stay.

We were referred to Beijing Tours Guide.com (contact@beijingtoursguide.com ) as a reputable guide company in Beijing by friends who had used the company previously.

Wendy at BTG set up the perfect 4 day tour which included pick up from our cruise ship in Tianjin in a private car and driving 2.5 hours to Beijing. The four days included most meals, all entrance fees (Forbidden City, Temple of Heaven, Summer Palace, Great Wall, Beijing Zoo) evening entertainment (Chinese Acrobat Show, Legend of Kung Fu Show) and a rickshaw
tour of a Hutong (traditional Chinese neighborhood).

Our guide was Herbie Ho who was very knowledgeable and had excellent English skills.

He went out of his way to make us feel comfortable in a environment which very different to us. He allowed us to make our schedule manageable by allowing us to determine how we used our days. His insights gave us a much better picture of modern urban China.

Our driver, Mr. Wong allowed Herbie to focus on us when we were in the car. Driving in Beijing is not for the faint of heart. Mr. Wong had been a taxi driver 20 years previously which gave great confidence in his ability.

I would heartily recommend this tour company, tour guide and driver. The cost left me smiling."
"Went here today, not sure what to say....it's very restored, not too much to see and the information cards in the museum gave very little information so didn't learn too much which was disappointing. I don't understand though, with the vast amount of toilets why the Chinese STILL let their kids pee wherever they want!! disgusting!!! Also the spitting they do is vile!"
"Very crowded; nothing particularly fabulous. Not sure what a the hype is about. Found Summer Palace had more to offer. If you are short on time, don't stop here."
I had seen temple of heaven and summer palace. They were more tranquil and beautiful than forbidden city. I preferred temple of heaven.
"We spent quite sometime in the Forbidden City and needed some food. There are two places in the Forbidden City that you can buy food. But the food is lousy because they are packed food and the box food I bought was prepared in February!!!! So, make sure you fill up your stomach before going to the city."
"It pays to have a guide take you through the forbidden city and provide history. Such a fantastic place, incredible to think this was once closed to all but dynasty."
"We loved hearing the history from our tour guide about the palace, how it was built, when, why, where they lived, etc. It was a lot of walking for our three kids but they did just fine! There was a nice gift shop and a bathroom (always be prepared with your own toilet paper!)."
"It is hard to take in all of the history, best to read up on it before you go. I dislked the hords of people and the Chinese are not polite. They walk in between you and your subject when taking a photo. They never look as tho they care about you or anyone else."
"In the town this Palace is without dubt the best in all Beijing. Very big and impresive, you feel like ""last emperor"". There are ""audioguides""... it is necesary several hours and to be ready for walking. It would be preferible to visit during low season, because thousand people visit every day this palace."
The size is formidable but walking through and getting a sense of how the emperor's ruled and lived was inspiring. Make sure you walk though the gardens at the back.
"If you love chinese history like me, one whole day won't even be sufficient for you to walk around the Forbidden City. If I was traveling alone, I would allocate the whole day just for this magnificent building alone, just reading all the descriptions, checking out all the mini museums and also admiring the beautiful woodwork! Unfortunately, I was traveling in an arranged tour with my family, so the trip was kind of rushed on and I believe I missed out on many things. Plus, there were so many people around, I was constantly afraid my some of my younger siblings or elderly would get lost in the crowd. It is advisable to avoid the peak time such as school holidays in China. I would love to go again in the future!"
Definitely worth the visit but expect a very large crowd. We went on the shoulder of the tourist season and it was (in some locations) wall to wall people. Still able to stop and get some great pictures.
"Our taxi driver dropped us in Tienanmen Square far away from any curb, but fortunately my guide and friend Ping was with me so I did not get lost among the crowd that was continually exiting from buses and cabs. The square is huge, so Ping helped me find the entrance to the Imperial Palace. After paying an entrance fee, you find yourself in another huge place, so you cross it and end up in a majestic Palace built by an ancient dynasty. You have a peek inside and can see wooden antique furniture, altars, banquettes, and chairs. You are not allowed inside, but you think ""what a great Palace."" But, wait! This is only the beginning as you go around the Palace and find yourself facing another big area that takes you to another palace. You are then told that you are in the Forbidden City and walk from one palace to another palace. This really is a huge city crowded with mostly Chinese tourists visiting from different parts of the mainland, taking pictures of everything from the colorful architecture to the Buddhist altars to the standing immobile guards. After being flabbergasted by the majesty of the place and having easily walked over five miles in this endless city, we decided to return to the Marriott and treated ourselves to a nice hot bath followed by a talented female physiotherapist's therapeutic massage. What a day!"
"A must do in Beijing. Guide was fine and worth it ish. Got rid of her
Once we got to the other end and went to see what we wanted to revisit. However, biggest downer was the fact that since Jan they apparently shut at noon on mondays. No-one told us that when we brought the tickets!"
Nice walk through but crowded. Get a good guide to make the most of it and if really busy go from rear to front.
"While crowded with mostly Chinese nationals, it was an experience to see and walk around the Forbidden City. We rented the audible tour guides to help explain the site - worth it."
"Didn't know what I thought it was going to be like, but it was just fabulous. Very busy with lots of Chinese as tourists! Read up on Chinese history especially last emperor."
From one side is a great piece of art and monument of Chinese history but from the other side it is very crowded place and it is difficult to feel the atmosphere of that place. Anyway it is an obligatory place to be.
"99% of visitors are Chinese people - but it's worth to go there, to experience the long history of China and it's emperors. There are many interesting buildings which are ""original chinese"" ;-). They all look similar so you can even feel lost - but I definitly recommend to go there."
"I had a wonderful guide that I hired outside the gate. She took me around and told me about the rich history. Although I was overwhelmed by all the information, I appreciate her efforts to teach me about the dynasty's and the way of life for the Emperors and his unfortunate staff that were hand picked to live behind the confines of the enormous walls. I did't like the big crowds that pushed their way to photograph the building interiors."
"This is a huge place and there were huge crowds (tours) waiting to get in. Once the gates opened, there still were tons of people,but we did disperse somewhat. You have to see this and watch the movie The Last Emperor again. It is too amazing to explain"
Once you get behind those gates you really feel that you're back in Imperial China - the buildings and artefacts are stunning.
"Grand, vast and magnificant, this is a must-see for anyone visiting Beijing. One can easily wander around in days in here. However, the number of people is also huge. As my boy couldn't get ready early enough, we arrived Tiananmen East around 10am, when the entrance (and the toilet) was swamped with a flock of tour groups. We decided to go to Tiananmen Sq first and returned later around 10.30, when there was still a crowd but less daunting. Through security, my boy was hungry, so I went to a restaurant on the right hand side when they are still selling some breakfast, and got 10 steamed buns (juicy pork inside) for 12 RMB!!! They were quite decent taste too so I was quite surprised. Then we queue to buy tickets, lots of touts trying to sell you tickets and also tour to Great Wall (ignore them), queue was long but not unbearable, there was a woman selling map and a brief guide book for 5RMB in the line, I had suspicion at first but hey, it was only 50p, it turned out to be quite a good idea and I saw lots of people buying tht.

Once through the gate we were just amazed. Despite the foggy weather, the Palace is just so beautiful and powerful. There were a lot of people, so we decided to do the 'West Path' to see the Emperor living quarter instead of the usual 'Central Path' for the Three Halls. My boy was so excited he kept imagining being a kung fu master or something - the vastness of the place means that he had space to run around (being a boy!)

The disappoitment lies with the display. First it is difficult to battle with the crowd to get to the display window, secondly the window only gives you a limited view, thirdly they don't light the display so it's hard to see, and finally they don't clean the window so it's full of dust and you can't see through very well anyway!!! That's why after a while I gave up looking at them, and concentrated on the buildings instead.

Coming out of the North Gate, we follow the direction and long queue to get on Bus 2 to Qian Men, we waited for 2 buses before we managed to get on one, and the buses were really packed. Coming to think about it, it may be better to hail a taxi as they seem to be quite plentiful. However as there are metal fences in the queue area I wasn't able to jump out of the queue.

Overall, I rate 5 star for the building(s), the garden of the Palace. It is worthwhile to do it. however, in terms of management and display, I would give a 3 star max. State of the toilet is very 'China' like - i.e. not very clean and long queue."
"This place is quite incredible, the number of buildings, the decoration, the statues, the sheer scale of the place is mind blowing. We walked around here (with several thousand others) and were amazed by everyhting.

The garden was particularly interesting.

Despite the large numbers walking around we never felt crushed or pushed around, it was very relaxed. There is so much to explore and see. Be prepared to spend several hours here if you want to see most of it.

Take some drinks and a snack with you, you can buy on site but you pay a bit extra, not that it costs a lot in China!"
"This is a beautiful place to go,the size of it takes your breath away and if you have a guide it is full of legend and myths,also facts.You can imagine guards and people milling around the complex in ancient times,lovley time was had here and memories tokeep for ever"
"The Forbidden Centre was used by the Emperor's who ruled China and the word 'majestic' is what I believe to be the most accurate way of describing it.

The use of an audio guide is necessary as it describes in detail all you would want to know about this wonderful attraction. You feel privileged walking around where none but royalty could even look towards without severe punishment.

The detail on the paintwork is just stunning and there are treasures to be seen all around this most wonderful of attractions.

A must for all who visit Bejing and its closeness to Tienanmen Square and the Mao Mausoleum men that you can spend a really worthwhile day in the vicinity of this site"
"I was reading EmpressOrchid by Anchee Min on the plane so seeing the real thing was a delight.
My experience: I read up on the history of the place (on the net and Eyewitness guidebook) so I could be more oriented to it. I didnt go throught the normal routes (going through ALL the gates) but went around the area looking for spots without too much tourists. We spent one whole morning here so that we didnt rush ourselves too much."
"There must have been, and I suppose there still are, massive egos that considered and came to build this 'Forbidden City' which is situated in the centre of Beijing and adjacent to Tiananmen Square. However, no visit to China is complete without exploring this huge attraction and all it has to offer."
"Amazing place, a bit scruffy, officials inexplicably closing some areas as we tried to see them. You need sharp elbows and a lack of British reserve to push in front of the locals to photograph the important exhibits"
"This is one historic site that does not disappoint. The vastness of the plazas and courtyards, the beautifully maintained and/or restored pavilions and palaces, and the lovely, if over-crowded, Imperial Garden are truly awe-inspiring. As one fascinated with the Dowager Empress Cixi, I saw my fill of Cixi-related buildings and heard my fair share of Cixi history. The audio guide, which worked for roughly 2/3 of my time in the Forbidden City was really informative, and the 5 Yuan guide I bought on the ticket line was also useful.

If I have one criticism, it's that the place was filled with tour groups with matching baseball caps. What's that about, anyway? My favorite was a group of my fellow Americans, one of whom yelled ""Susan, It's just a hole in the ground!"" at the top of her lungs. I guess it was added amusement."
This unique beautiful huge palace is in bad condition in comparison with other important palaces like Versailles.The restoration that is done is certainly not enough. I advice to pat the extra to get into the jewelry exhibition. In addition to the beautiful Items displayed this part is also better preserved.
"It's extraordinarily crowded and not really that interesting. There are various buildings you can peer into, but there are usually so many people crowded around the openings that you can't see anyway.

It's easy to buy tickets there. When I visited, there was a woman selling detailed maps and guidebooks in the ticket line for 5 RMB. I wouldn't bother with a guide or an overpriced tour."
"so much of history in it !!
a great place, probably one of the very few places in the world in size and magnitude.it is not very ancient, but a beautifully laid out structural marvel.

Chinese emperors lived and worked here,with all their staffs and army.there are many gates before the actual living quarters.
now some small side quarters are converted to museums.

the garden at the back is a let down, it is neither lovely nor big commensurate to such a big complex.it is rather smallish.one can get out of the complex at the extreme back gate.

overall, one of the best places in china to visit."
"Go there early to avoid crouds. The park at the end is quite nice too. We had a pretty good time there, being first timers and we went on our second day in Beijing."
"When you visit Forbidden City most likely you will enter the Main Gate which is the South Gate near Tienanmen Square. And you will visit the Forbidden City by walking straight through Forbidden City and finish at the North Gate. This is where you will find a surprise. It is quite a challenge to find transportation, here at the North Gate. At the entrance, in the South Gate, there is a Subway Station. But at the North Gate, you will not find it. Yes there are Buses, but usually information about Bus route is not as simple as Subway route. Most tourist will have a subway map, but most likely they won't have a bus route map in their hands. And if you ask for information, you will get frustrated. Most bus drivers in China do not speak English at all. Not at all, even the simplest word!!.

How about Taxi? Yes there are Taxis, but you will find a super long line to wait for the Taxi. And most Taxis will not use the meter.

The only choice is to go back to the South Gate at Tienanmen Square by foot. And you can not do that by just simply walk back in the opposite direction through the forbidden city. They will not allow you to go back in to the Forbidden City. Here is what you can do. From the north Gate you have to walk to the right or left direction for about 700 meters and then you walk back to the south to Tienanmen Square. It's a looooong walk...

And the most scary thing is, the North Gate is where all the scams are. While you walk, you will find very nice European car with a nice well dressed driver approaches you and offers you to get in to their car. I did not know what they want, but they look like mafia guy to me. I turned down their offer off course. And you will also find people offering rickshaw with cheap fare. But they will trick you. I have my own experience when my wife and I were here. We were approached by a rickshaw (well it's not a rickshaw, it's a tricycle). The tricycle owner offer me a ride to Tienanmen square for 3 Yuan. He show me his three fingers. The offer sounds too good for me, that is why I was making sure by paying him 3 Yuan in advance. He received the money with smile. My wife and I jumped to the tricycle and then he paddled the tricycle toward his friend. He asked me to get into his friend's tricycle. I thought he wanted me and my wife to move to his friend's tricycle. I jumped to his friend's tricycle, but when my wife was about to follow me getting into his friend's tricycle, he said he wants my wife to stay in his tricycle. Obviously they want to separate my wife and me. I refused to do that and jumped back to his tricycle to be with my wife. He gave up and let me & my wife together ride in his tricycle. He paddled again and approached another friends of him. This time it's not a tricycle owner. It's a side car motorcycle. I had enough. I grabbed my wife hand and walked away. With the corner of my eye I could see the tricycle owner paddled away. The side car motorcycle owner ran after us. He seemed so eager to take me to Tienanmen Square with his motorcycle. My brain was having a simple calculation. There is no way a side car motorcycle would take me to any where with 3 Yuan which is only about 0.5 USD. He must have a plan to trick me. We ran away from him. Thank God he stopped running...

The China government should have a better solution for this. They should provide a free or cheap loop bus or anything to take the tourists at the North Gate back to the South Gate. It is very obvious that there is a chaotic situation at the North Gate. Many helpless tourists are confused and clueless to get back to the South Gate. I don't know why the government let this kind of chaos continues..."
"I have always wondered how this place could have been live and once inside the walls my ideas were confirmed. You feel a sensation of peace and magnificence and start to imagine – almost see- the emperor and his entourage walking on these streets and huge squares. On the historic and artistic point of view I think there is not much to say, this place talks by itself. Modernity (tourists facilities for eg.) is not intrusive at all, so you will never lose the feeling to be back in the old times. Do not forget to bring the camera with you and wear comfortable shoes. Take at least 3 hours, not less than that if you want to appreciate this great place. Taxi leaves you on the opposite side of the entrance and it could take a while to get there by walk; evaluate the possibility to get a lift by one of the many bicycle riders waiting for tourists. If back in Beijing I will visit it again, no doubts."
"Very crowded at this day (saturday), can't imagine how will become in sunday. Everything is nice, but the exit tooooo faaarrr away from the entrance. And the security didn't allow peoples to get back to the entrance from the inside.
So confused how to back again."
"If you've been to the Temple of Heaven you don't need to go to the Forbidden City. There are massive expanses of nothing inside and let's face it - when you've seen one pagoda-style building in Beijing you've seen them all. It was pretty disappointing and has no ""wow"" factor whatsoever. Upon exiting the Forbidden City you will be accosted by rickshaw drivers trying to take you places, people trying to book you on other tours, ladies carrying children asking for money etc etc and after a while it just gets annoying. Avoid, unless you have time/money to kill."
"the forbidden city was more than i imagined. from looking at the pictures you don't realise that once you walk through the big red door under chairman mao that there is just building after building with vast space in between. 980 rooms to be exact. our tour guide was fantastic and explained why some things the way they were. big steps over each door and hall because the emperor was scared that a ghost might come, there was no trees in the open space for fear that people would hid behind it when trying to kill him etc."
"Tis will take you a good 2-3 hours to get through. I recommend to get a guide as it is incredibly busy here all the time. This is a place all of the Chinese come to see and can be overwhelming with all of the people. But do not hire people that offer to tour you outside the gate, they will scam you and not do a good job. Mothers are many tour agencies that you can hire ahead of time that will speak great English and help you understand the history and importance of the buildings. If you've seen the move Last Emperor, it will also help while touring.

It is sad because this as well as other landmarks are not taken care of by the government. Pollution and age are deteriorating the face of the buildings. Mehta is left of the furniture and relics, are sealed up in the buildings and not taken care of. Dust and cobwebs are everywhere. It's sad really, but I'm glad to have sen it and experience Chinese culture."
"First tried going there on a Sunday morning - the courtyard was absolutely packed with tour groups (and this was not even peak tourist season). Returned on a weekday when things were quieter. The grounds are vast and it does take a while to cover everything. Also, entrance is only at the southern gate with the exit at the northern gate. The downside to this is that while there are subway stations close to the entrance, it is quite a walk to the nearest station in the north.
The buildings and architecture are wonderful, but it was disappointing not to be able to view some of the artifacts from a closer distance. Where these were available for display, it was either behind glass windows or from behind a railing at a distance.
Do not go at the weekend."
"Try don't go on weekends that is insane how packed is. When you cross the first wall got at the en on the right to get the tickets and there you go to another world, is one of my favorites places to go around the world. Go I can't describe how good is"
"Not going to bore you with all the detail as there are plenty of guides out there and articles on the Internet. This is a simply highly recommended visit. Some key things though which are not seen on tourist guides:
1) Transport from there: Don't expect to be able to find a taxi from there. It's simply impossible and hotels also recommend to avoid it. Even if you try to take a taxi a bit further out the taxi drivers will try to charge you more without the meter. So just simply get out as no meter equals less weight in your pocket.
2) Tour guides: I think you should go alone and enjoy the sights. Should you wish to get a tour guide and this is really easy you can actually find them outside the entrance. Don't know about prices.
3) ""Automatic Guides"": Spend RMB 40 (£4) and they are totally worth it. They are wifi and the audio is interactive in a way that starts speaking dependent on the part of the palace you're in. Don't pause the guides as you may forget go switch it on and when you move on you may think the guide has nothing to say.
4) You will find yourself at the forbidden city for about 3-4 hours so plan your day well ahead."
"Yes, it would be like going to Rome and not seeing the Vatican. We used a guide, don't be put off by the initial asking price. We eneded up paying Y150. The guide took us through and then we walked back on our own to spend more time at what we thought were the more interesting spots."
This is an amazing place. Don't bother with the English audio guides as they often malfunction (they are GPS based) and read out loud what is printed on English interpretive signs. I wish I had hired an actual guide.
Many people there but worth seeing the site of the Last Emperor Movie. Very impressive worth the investment of time
"We saw the Forbidden City the day after Beijing had a big snow fall so it looked really magical, particularly against a blue sky. It was great having a guide to explain all the different areas too. Worth seeing for sure."
"I like overall I may see, we didnt know thta they close at noon on Monday so we arrive at 10:30 and no time to visit all the palace"
"First time to Forbidden City, very impressive!!
We were lucky, arrive early morning with no crowd, so it was a very peaceful walk...
We appointed an agent to arrange all stuffs for us, ticket, transports, and ofcourse the tour guide did a good job in giving us a tutorial of chinese history! love it!
Will definitely come back."
"Absolutely amazing - the scale, the architecture. Make sure you have a guide or a good book to provide the information on the history and the architecture.

Unlike European palaces, this is more about the scale and the architecture of the buildings than the contents of the buildings. The rooms that display living quarters are not done to the same standard to those used to European palaces/chateaux would expect. Rooms are behind dirty glass so very difficult to see.

Allow plenty of time and be prepared to be pushy in key locations to get views of the Emperors thrones.

Definitely worth the visit."
"There is too much sense of history and interest not to go here. Please go with a tour to understand the historic significance of the buildings, the number of statutes on the roof, and the reason of the space on the grounds. We were here in March with a tour, where there was less crowds. Skip the peak period (summer months) as the crowds and the heat makes this unbearable."
"A very well-maintained complex of ancient palace. SO many people visiting this place
Similar with the same palace in Korea"
The palace ground is huge and you can understand why it was so royal at one point of time.Recommend to get a local Chinese guide who can explain to you the history behind the palace. Be prepared to be pushed by the local crowd as everybody tries to get a glimpse of what was inside the palace coz a lot of palaces do not let you in. So you need to catch a glimpse through a glass window.A lot of walking and a lot of places to click snaps - so be prepared to have a camera and comfortable shoes.
Expected more after all the write ups and all the buildings we visited. Got some good pictures from the outside but not a lot else.
"Together with the great wall, this is One of two must see 4+ hour activities when in Beijing. Dont plan both in the same day. Yes, it's touristy and there are LOTS of people, but still very much worth it. I feel it's worth to hire a Chinese tour guide who speaks English to hear some of the stories. But, don't let him/her rush you through (or pressure you into buying any art). You need time to absorb this place!

When you finish, if you are fit enough, cross the street and hike the small hill on the north/exit of the forbidden city. From here, looking back, you can see the whole forbidden city from above...and it only cost 2CNY. You can also see out to the summer palace, the Olympic park, etc...when it is clear. Try to do it on a clear day, but don't hold your breath for that."
"Forbidden City was WONDERFUL.

We took the advice of Fodor's and followed the left-most path. This route was less crowded and I still felt like I saw the highlights.

We were there around 3 hours and overwhelmed by the size and beauty (and extravagance) of everything.

Get a local guide and skip the GPS-guided tour device.

The entrance and exit are choke points with huge crowds. Hold onto children and keep an eye on friends. I'm 6'0"", so I could see over the throng of people, but you could easily become separated."
"Lots of walking to be done,so be prepared to walk in your sports shoes!Vast area ,visiting in March made us shiver in the chill and icy winds!"
You need to allow at least 3 hours minimum - so much to soak up and the audio-tour is definitely worth while. Dont be tempted in to the numerous little 'exhibitions' of 'art' which you will pressured into buying!
"You may have seen 'The Last Emperor', which was filmed in this place - but nothing prepares you for the wonder of it all. The scale of the place is nothing short of amazing. Ladies - Beware! Leave the heals at home. The stonework is quite uneven"
"We stated approx 2 miles away from the forbidden city at st Regis (great hotel and highly recommend). We arrived in the evening but when for a stroll to see forbidden city at night. We pubs Beijing to be quite safe. You can't enter forbidden city but it was less crowded at night and the entrance gate with photo of chairmen Mao was nicely light up and not crowded great for photos. We came back during the day and it was a zoo and we were there brightly and early as we were jet laged. And when I say a zoo I mean thousands of people.
Luckily to the right of the main gates is a little park no one was going there but we decided to roam around. We paid a total of $2 to enter. As we were walking through the park there was an entrance way on the left to the imperial place. We basically cut the line of thousands of people who were waiting to walk through the gates under chairmen Maos photo. Entrance costs approx $6 pp. it was worth it the palace and temples inside are very much worth it. There are lots of people around but you can roam around the grounds. We really enjoyed it."
"hard to believe that we all bought into the concept of royalty not that many years ago. Opulent, expensive and exclusive."
"When in Beijing, you cannot skip this. Very impressive and huge, plus a very important piece of history. There is a lot of walking but not too much for about 1/2 a day or so."
"Stop and gaze at all the intricate artwork on the wood.
Very nice park surrounding it. Seniors get free admission, so many are playing cards, playing musical instruments, and enjoying their leisure time here."
"It's nice to see where was the house of the emperors, but be aware. It's not permitted to see the inside of the buildings, if u go in the weekend it's gonna be crowded, and the tour guides get to ""expansive"", meaning they get abusive. Don't get yourself ""robbed""..."
"This is situated near Tiananmen Square. Give yourself plenty of time to visit both as the Forbidden City is quite large.
I would also recommend having a guide as they can impart so much interesting information."
"If you have not visited the forbidden city, then you definitely have not been to beijing. This is one of the places I wanted to see since young. Try visiting the palace early as it will take you hours to finish exploring the place. Do not miss out on other small areas like the dragon wall, where you are required to pay entrance fee as well. Also, take your time to walk and enjoy the scenery of the imperial garden."
"Words fail me. If you see nothing else in China, you have to see the Forbidden City. Lots of walking but not difficult. A whole day, maybe two."
"We went to the Forbidden City as part of a day tour in a small group with a Chinese, English speaking guide. It is a very large complex and quite breath- taking in size. The architecture and history is fascinating with its blue, red and gold buildings. Unfortunately we didn't have time to wander as the guide whisked us through the Forbidden City giving us the history behind each building as we went. In such a short time it was too much to take in! It is certainly a lovely place to visit and I would certainly recommend it."
"The moment you enter the gates, a different world awaits you. It feels like you walk into the set of an ancient chinese movie."
"I cam here on the first day I was in Beijing. The Imperial Palace is in Tienanmen Square and very easy to locate (walk towards the iconic Chairman Mao's photograph). The site is very big and I suggest getting an audioguide to enjoy the most of the palace. If you walk around the full complex, it would take 4 hours. A fair warning that summers in Beijing can take a toll if you plan to walk for that long. Overall, an excellent cultural site which requires a dedicated half day minimum."
"It does get dull after the 4th hall or so, but still a must see. It is a fun place to be, I enjoyed the garden part especially"
"After the first 4or 5 rooms,they all seem very similar.The sheer size of the place,one cannot believe .You cannot enter into any of the rooms,so crowd around doorways to glimpse a peek at the now dull and dusty red/gold interiors and thrones.The gardens and ancients trees are beautiful.
Still,truly amazing places that transports one back to the dynasties.obviuously ,the most touristy spot in China,even in January."
"There is nothing wrong with the Forbidden City except - it felt like we went through numerous large ""gate"" areas that all looked the same. The same architecture and the same open spaces.

Granted the forbidden city houses a great many treasures. So if you are interested in a museum like experience, this might be good - however it will be a lot of walking.... through a lot of gates.... through vast spaces... to see them.

As for architecture - again - beautiful - yet one starts to become numb to it because it is very repetitious.

I am giving it a poor rating because it was not my cup of tea. Had I known more about this attraction I might have skipped it and done something else with my time."
"I just spent a full day there - don't be fooled to buy tickets to non-official desks - they will cost you 50% more, and the queue at the official desks seems long but moves fast (less than 5min waiting). Take an audio guide - much better quality than any guide and cheaper.
And then enter the forbidden city and just walk at your pace, enjoying the place (the audio guide will recognize where you are and tell you all you need to know in your own mother tongue). There is the possibility to buy drinks and food inside, so don't worry. SPend as much as you want and finish the day in the beautiful garden,"
"This place was without doubt the most impressive and imposing place Ive ever visited. Nobody can understand just how impressive until they actually visit. Ancient massive foreboding and forbidding, vast, colorful, it has its own atmosphere which has to be felt to understand. Paris, Rome and Greece has nothing like it. I would go again just to see the forbidden city if nothing else"
"Get yourself a good English speaking guide to walk you through the square and the Forbidden City, it's well worth getting the low down on the history of this magnificent place that just walking through"
Shame mainly empty spaces to look at but you do get a real impression of what it was like. Can get crowded and limited facilities on site. Some areas have obviously really been well restored. Worth a visit for sure and some info in English too.
The forbidden city is a must visit . Its size will amaze you the photos cannot do this place justice. afterwards you can watch the last emperor a 3.5 hour epic filmed alot in the grounds that details the life of PuYi
"Do not miss the Forbidden City but arrive early to miss the massive, and I do mean massive, crowds. Since the makeup of the crowds are mainly Chinese citizens from other provinces, orderly viewing of the interior of palaces and chambers (restricted to viewing from the outside) are almost impossible as there's constantly pushing and jostling for photos of the interior by everyone. If you miss these crowded times, you should have a better chance of viewing and taking photos of the emperor's throne, royal seat, etc and even might be able to take photos without being pushed around. A good, patient and knowledgeable guide to explain what you are looking at is also important."
"I was instantly amazed at the size of the palace grounds and had to walk around about half the area to enter. The buildings are not accessible but are easily viewed through open doors. If you take your time, understand a little about the Chinese culture and the rich history of the palace and those who lived there, I guarantee you will not be disappointed"
"Unfortunately, the day I went the entrance to the Forbidden City was closed. I never got inside. I did however, visit the parks around the city and had some great views of the city. Because I went early March, the parks did not have leaves or flowers. I imagine in a few weeks they would be beautiful to walk through. I was able to walk around the city by the water, but the secrets of the city are still a mystery to me!"
"You can't go to Beijing and not see the Forbidden City. It's a long walk, but when you're gawking at its magnificence, you don't notice how long you've been walking. There's a mandatory security check by the entrance, but with our tour guide, we bypassed the long line. Thank goodness!"
"With the help of our tour guide, the Forbidden palace cam alive. I could not believe how immense the building and grounds were. The palace has more than 9,000 rooms and was instrumental in the life of the Yongle reign of the Ming dynasty. Ove a period of 500 years, a total of 24 emperors lived and reigned here.
The very old bald cypress trees surround the palace and are protected b the government. This palace is on the World Heritage List by UNESCO>"
"one of the things on my bucket list. as close as you can get to experiencing life in the ancient world of china.

expect to spend hours there, especially if you intend to spend some time at the Palace Museum. try to read up on this magnificent historical site before visiting, to better appreciate the functions of the various buildings, meanings of artifacts etc. the electronic guide is useful - it recognises which section of the palace you're at. if cost is not an issue, do engage the services of a personal guide. the place is massive - i couldn't help but wonder if any of the emperor or empress or the concubines has ever been to all the sections of the palace (bearing in mind, women in those days had their feet bound)..."
"Again a great deal of walking in required to get the most out of this place . Can be a bit crouded, but as it is so extensive it is always possible to find space to get those wonderful photos. Make sure you have plenty of space on your memory cards."
"The Forbidden City is something not to be missed when visiting Beijing. It is an incredible part of China’s history and the architecture is beautiful.

My advice would be to ensure you have a decent amount of time to spend there. We ignored the fact that our lonely planet guide said to allow for an entire day there, and rather we only went for 2 hours or so, wasn’t really enough time to take it all in. It was pretty overwhelming. Also it gets VERY busy during the day, so I would recommend going earlier, and as other reviewers have mentioned, it gets very hot there in the summer and there is limited shade. Bring lots of water, as well as snacks, as options for food and water once you’re in is limited.

Also if we were to do it again, we would probably either use the electronic guide or take a guided tour through, it would have helped to better explain the meaning/history of each building rather than just reading the signs."
It is enormous. a little repetitive. Get the electronic guide or u will be wandering around for hours not knowing difference between one building and the next.
A very interesting trip. The buildings are structurally beautiful and this was an intriguing visit. The only downside was that there was very limited shade available so beware of the heat; make sure you pack lots of sun cream and water!!
This is a must-see in Beijing and incredibly interesting. Plan to spend a couple of hours roaming around.
You should allow 3-4 hours minimum at this site. To get the most out of it read up on it's history before you go - you'll really be wowed by the 999 rooms and gardens!
"It was incredible ! A must see in China ! You absolutely need a good guide to understand all the story ( or you can rent audio tours ) and 3 hours ! For perfect photo you must go on the small mountain, opposite of the Forbidden city !"
A must see while in Beijing! The Forbidden City is quite large and will take at least 2 hours for a good tour. I recommend renting one of the audio tours.
This place was OK...nothing exciting and wow about it. It's definitely worth seeing just to say that you went there but there is so much better places in Beijing that is worth seeing.
"What history, what beauty!!!! What an unforgettable experience the Forbidden Palace is. When you are walking up to the Palace there are so many stalls, exhibitions and art that you are immersed in that but when you reach the huge red doors of the Forbidden Palace you are taken to another era. The Forbidden City is somewhere that I will always remember for its sheer size and history."
"So huge, amazing to think that when this place was being used normal people would of been beheaded for getting this close to the throne without permission! Some areas are not as good condition as most but they are workin to fix this. A lot of the side rooms are shut so you can't see where the emperor slept! And they could defo do with adding mote English for descriptions of the items on display!"
It's Huge! Really I mean it. If you have little ones you may want to bring a stroller. Our 6 year old did fine but I saw many parents struggling. It is awesome. Get a guide. You can hire them as you walk in. This will give you the sense of old china. I The buildings are impressive. Make sure you have your camera!
"This place is really huge. Soo big and need to take a whole day to cover the palace. Need to watch the movie ""The Last Emperor"" to understand some of the history."
"First tip would be to get there early. The queues become very long very quickly. Expect a lot of pushing and shoving, as the Chinese are very good at queue jumping.
Once inside the city, the buildings are amazing and just breathtaking to look at, it really is a different world. You get a great sense of the old China here and it's well worth a visit."
My husband and I visited in late February and we were lucky enough to visit on an uncrowded day. The structures were very impressive as you saw each palace layer. There are stairs that lead up to each structure and the structures are not handicapped friendly or easily accessable for someone with mobility issues. You can easily enjoy this place without climbing the stairs to see the inside of each structure as long as you can walk for a distance. It is amazing to see these structures and see where the emporer and concubines lived so many years ago very impressive.
"We did the forbidden city in December of 2012. The cold was so biting it made us hurry through the city. The place is enormous and it would probably take 2 days to see it all. We enjoyed the history and enormity of the location. A definite visit if you get to Beijing. A side note, go when its warm:)."
I went in the afternoon and it was like a zoo! I got tired of seeing the same thing layer after layer of gates and not hearing the significance of the structures inside. It was unfortunate!
"Forbidden city with China long history, a king palace, it really worthy to go and visit. But it is always crowdy."
"My 11 year old son and I visited forbidden city 23 feb 2013, which was still the holiday period so there were lots of locals/ tourists around. We took the subway - (it doesn't really matter if you get off at Tianamen east or west station). Once out of the subway you just walk 100 metres or so and you will see the entrance of the imperial palace or "" outer court""' right opposite tianamen square. This area has a very heavy police and military presence that can be quite confronting initially.
We were approached a couple of times outside the palace by people offering to be a guide for us and in the end we decided to pay a local girl to act as our guide. We paid approx 20aud for 2 hours, which ended up being a great investment. Outside the gates we were also approached by 2 girls who were very friendly suggesting we just accompany them around the corner to look at their art work; we didn't go and later found out this is quite a trap for tourists who then end up paying large amounts of money for art and in tea houses...so beware...
Our guide was able to bypass the long queues for the entry ticket and once we entered this amazing place we were mesmerised! We spent approx 4 hours in the ""city"", it really is a big place and well worth the visit. We could only exit one way, which wa difficult to work out how to get back to the subway, but we ended up working out that you catch a number 1 bus that takes you back around to the ""front"" of the city where you can then get on the subway. A few tips....visit both tianamen square and the forbidden city on the same day...you really should allow the whole day if time permits, wear comfy walking shoes - there is lots of walking, take snacks, especially if travelling with children and a local guide is definitely beneficial."
Walking in a city that was closed for 500 years. Real sense of history. it gets very crowded even out of season
"The forbidden place needs to be on your list if you are ever here. You could spend from a few hours to a day exploring. Cheap to enter and definitely get a walking guide, avoid the scammers close by. If you are white or black, expect people to stop you to take pictures with you, it can be fun but it does get annoying in my case."
"Very impressive as you may see in lots of movies. It takes you a bit time to walk through. The palaces and especially the gardens are very nice. To be honest I expected more. Walk up the hill to the Beijing center it you will have great view over the Forbidden city. Be careful - you may be offered some unofficial guides and books, also there are waiting many young people who want to talk and practise English - than they take you to tea room and you may end up paying thousands of RMB. Get a rid of them."
"Very busy over the new year holiday. We bought a ticket near the entrance but no one ever collected it or asked to see it, so a waste. We were unable to get into the main attraction after discussing the options with a sweet tour group escort who also intended to visit with his 45 guests but we were both shocked to learn it was closed due to being a Monday. We did step into a restaurant nearest the interior entrance and it was inexpensive and delightful - especially the eggplant. We caught a ride on a trolley but it only took us around the building and dumped us out on the side street. But the garden next door made up for all this was lacking. PS remember most of China expects you to bring your own TP."
"According to the Chinese government Beijing has 5 of the top ten tourist destinations in China. I am not sure I agree with their list but there is no question that allocating half a day (2 - 4 hours) to spend wandering around the old Forbidden City is worthwhile. It is the only way to get a sense of the scale and grandeur of this former Imperial Home and feel something of the opulent side of Chinese history. Then afterwards make sure you wonder around the few still standing ""hutong""s (alleyways) a mile or so North of GuGong (literally People's Palace - what the government now calls the old Forbidden City) to see the other end of the scale. Though many courtyard homes are fully restored and inhabited by government officials and foreigners, there are a still few small courtyards occupied by multiple families with only rudimentary plumbing and electricity. Though similar in basic concept, the difference in scale and presentation, between a small traditional Chinese courtyard and the Emperor's former home, could not be more vast. Not a bad example for the two extremes of life in China, even today."
Been to forbidden city twice and still not getting enough of it ! Somehow there are lots of interesting stories at this attractions. Must get a very good guide to explain the history of forbidden city for those who are interested to know more. There are many different routes to see different places and some tour guide tend to skip certain places that might be of interest to you.
"We went to the Forbidden City during winter and it seems to be the best time since there's not that many crowds and the weather is conducive to walking (summer weather must be dreadful with the people and heat). And you will have to walk to see this historical attraction, so wear comfortable shoes.

We were part of a tour group when we visited, so we just spent an hour or so, as we just traversed one end to the other end, exiting at Tiananmen Square. It is best you do it yourself as you can easily lose 2 to 3 hours just exploring the side palaces, pathways, etc., imagining yourself as a member of the Emperor's retinue or reliving scenes from The Last Emperor, Curse of the Golden Flower or even Mulan.

Visiting The Forbidden City today is awe-inspiring, imagine what earlier outsiders feel when they walk alone, escorted by guards, when the cross the immense grounds back in the day."
"The vast area and the number of palaces inside it explains why it is one of the most famous sites in Beijing. Before you enter i suggest you have already taken notes from the internet for each monument inside the forbidden city or buy the guided tour which is relatively cheap and in many languages. Apart from the monuments, you should understand the way the emperors think and act and learn some parts of history concerning the last 2 centuries and the role the European countries played in China"
"my wife and i went here for the chinese new year.. this was the first time for both of us as my wife is chinese. I will have to say first that for being a winter time day there was many people out looking at the history of this place.. we also took the daughter who has never traveled this far, SO this was a family time for us.. I enjoyed very much the history of this place. the total beauty of everything.. Yes there is a lot of commercial shops. but even in america it is the same no matter where you go.. I enjoyed the history of each building as i had a english tour recording device so no matter where i went it turned on and spoke english to me and told me the history of each place.. i have seen many chinese movies of this place but to walk it and feel it was something.. I would tell anyone to visit the wonderful place.."
"Even though I had heard about The Forbidden City for years, I was nevertheless impressed with the size and scope of this place. Even in the cold weather of January, the incredible number of buildings, courtyards, walking paths, etc. were very interesting. We were treated to fresh snow/ice which made the visit almost like a fairyland."
Long long long walk not much to see that int the same but should go to say you be been take drink and snacks
"It is an enormous complex however most of the gates/halls look very similar and so after the first few, it's a bit tiring. You need a guide or an audioguide, just a good guide book that points out the important sites and their history. We walked through to the end and then climbed the pagoda in Jingshan park which gives an excellent view over the whole Forbidden city."
"Not to miss but went Chinese New Year so very busy . Think best time is summer not winter

Fabulous building but shops are very commercial and rubbish"
"I travelled to Beijing together with my wife. We had heard a lot about the Forbidden City.
The experience was overwhelming and we spent many hours looking at the architecture, paintings, written documentation and so on.
The visit gave us a glimse of the history. We had a very interesting afternoon in the forbidden city and the imperial palace."
"Wow, what else can one say. Even our little children were taken with the history and its beauty.
We hired a local guide from outside and this really helped alot. She took us around and told us about all the places and events and it was like walking through the pages of a history book. It was really HOT and we used umbrellas for the sun.
We met the last surviiving relative of the last emperor as he was working on scrolls and we did the very touristy -Dress up for a pictire- as the kids loved trying on the imperial head dresses. An incredible experience we will never forget!"
"The Forbidden City is a must-see in Beijing. To optimize the experience, watch the movie ""The last Emperor"" before your visit. Be prepared for a lot of pushing from the crowds trying to get glimps of the inside of the buildings."
"It is impossible to enter the Forbidden City and not be moved by the history of the place and imagine yourself as a cowering foreignor awestruck by the magesty of the emperor. After some hesitation, we ""employed"" a ""tour guide"" that approached us at the entrance. On balance, that was a good decision as he explained many features of the Forbidden City that would have otherwise escaped our attention. However, at one point he also ushered us into a room where the supposed nephew of the last emporer - a master calligropher - would create a tapestry for us. Although we aren't sure, it seemed like a scam and was an uncomfortable experience."
"So, I'm not going to repeat what everyone has said. If you're reading this, you probably already know the history or some of it.

This site is spectacular. Admission to some areas is free, while others come at a price - I believe it was 40 RMB. While going to wait in line for tickets, a man approached me offering me a ticket for 60 RMB, telling me that the tickets were sold out and that everyone in line was about to be disappointed. I didn't believe this and joined the line.. soon after a 2nd line opened up and I got my ticket even faster! The man who tried selling me a ticket was gone and I had only spoken to him a minute prior.

Lots of people try to sell you things when you come inside. Everything from tang hulu, maps, and even cheap hats meant to look like the emperor's! There was even what looked to be an extremely disabled dwarf man trying to get donations.. sitting next to the walkway in the city. How Beijing officials let these people inside is beyond me, and definitely detracted from the experience. I had about four different men approach me offering to give a tour, but I declined each one.

I was shocked to see old men picking their noses and spitting on the ground inside the city - have they no respect for the national landmarks? I could never imagine doing this at the Lincoln Memorial or some similar site.. but these folks were treating it like a dirty backyard!

Once inside the paid areas of the city.. things were a little better.. but there was still trash to be found. The historic sites were there.. and walking through the whole city took almost three hours - but it was worth it!

Overall, a great experience.. I just wish some of the Chinese at the site saw the historical value of the site instead of dollar signs. Probably the worst part was a ""flying through the forbidden city"" store which plastered your image to a pre-recorded video of aerial footage of the Forbidden City and Beijing. This seemed to be an officially sanctioned store.. and only brought about my distaste for the commercialization of this site."
"Brilliant place.
But it was such a shame to see how poorly kept some of the halls and exhibits are.
Most of the glass boxes presenting riches and antiques were so dusty and dirty the exhibits looked dull and cheap.
And the thousands of tour groups walking the palace meant we practically didn't get close to anything.
Moral of the story, go early, avoid the horde and get the audio tours."
"I liked all the beautiful buildings in this area. The poor guards had to stand still for 2 hrs. at a time, and it was freezing cold during the time we went. Lots of history and culture to be learned here."
"This is the palace museum; also know as the Purple Forbidden City. It is the largest and most well reserved imperial residence in China today .It was forbidden for the commen people in the old days,and it's like a city goes on and on and on.The Forbidden City was built begin in 1406 and it took 14 years to built it. The first ruler who actually lived here was Ming Emperor Zhudi. The distance From North to south is 961 meters, and 753 meters from east to west. And the area of about 725,000 square meters. The Imperial Palace has 8704 rooms.It has very good ""Fengshui"" location ,you will not feel regret when you are being here"
This place is literally enormous! I would recommend after walking through the FC next day visit The Temple of Heven across the street and take a look at the Forbidden City from a perspective. It is unforgettable!
"The Imperial Palace is a must see in Beijing, it well preserved palace, make sure you hire a guide, there is too much to see and learn here. It will definitely take half a day or more to see. There is an antique museum shop maintained by the government and it is some good antiques (you can bargain there as well :)) ."
"Like everyone else who has fallen for this, it was my first night in the city after extensive traveling throughout the rest of China, and I just wanted to see Tiananmen briefly before resting after a long day's trip. Like everyone else who has fallen for this, I stupidly believed the two young ladies who approached me ""to celebrate the [Chinese] New Year with some drinks."" They chose the tea house, right near Tiananmen Square and the Forbidden City. It was the only one open (holiday eve, remember) so I stupidly believed it was chosen at random. We chatted for awhile, and got seated in a back room, with a waitress that looked extremely frustrated at us for being there. She brought in ""special"" menus without prices at the side, and for good reason: The total bill, for two pots of tea between the three of us, WAS ¥1700 RMB (¥560/person). I was astonished, but figured it must be a Beijing thing. I mentioned that a pot of tea anywhere else in China was ¥18 RMB at most. She explained that this was Beijing, not the rest of China. I asked her why she invited me out for drinks in the first place; she skillfully deflected the question. I paid my third grumpily, as one of the ladies handed over her card to the rude waitress and the other appeared not to pay at all. It didn't register that this might just have been a scam until we said our goodbyes. I feel horrible and sick now. Morale of the story: Don't believe ANYONE or ANYTHING you hear or see while in this touristy area. In fact, stick with the other Western tourists."
"This is going to be a short review: go! It was hot and humid the day we went. It was also crowded. i would ask a tour guide for advice on when there would be less people, but it is a very popular tourist destination for Chinese and foreigners, so I am not sure if there is ever a ""slow"" time."
So far and after 9 days in Beijing this is the best of all. Difficult to explain in just a few words. It i massive. Actually there are so many things to see. Different museums and palaces. You will need at least a whole day and perhapstwo if you want to visit all. You can see also the rooms of the last emperor and his wifes....
"We visited on a very cold and damp day and the grounds and floors were very slippery. Had I known how I would drop my camera and then almost fall, I would've chosen to go on a different day. This is a huge complex and it seemed that we missed a large number of exhibits that are off of the main corridor due to the treachery of attempting the stairs. Given that, I still rate this 5 stars! It is an absolute must-see attraction simply due to its size and history. I fully intend to revisit The Forbidden City on a better weather day, to more fully gain an appreciation of this site."
Over 600 years of history. Walking through the complex has so much cultural significance. The building structures preserve so much of the Ming and Qing dynasties.
"This complex is huge so give yourself plenty of time to visit. From Jan to March it is only open before noon on a Monday, so avoid visiting on that day unless you really have to as you will not have time to enjoy it properly. I spent 7 hours there.

Entrance is 40rmb at the south gate. It is well worth spending 40rmb on the audio guide in order to bring purpose to what you are looking at. It has an earpiece and works using a GPS system, thus automatically turns on at a point of interest.

Entering through the Meridian gate you see the Gate of Supreme Harmony, which then leads to the first of the ceremonial halls. It is only when there that you appreciate how big theses spaces/structures are. I was there early on a winter morning so there were very few people around.

Following the audio guide takes you through the main halls then to the right into the gallery of treasures. You have to pay an additional 10rmb to enter, but it is worth it as the buildings are different to in other parts. The gallery of treasures is itself a bit disappointing and you can see better things through the windows in the living quarters. I almost missed the second part of the gallery as i thought it was just the entrance to a gift shop. Don't forget to double back and visit the stone drums gallery (stone boulders with inscriptions) but it does not have much explanation in English and it is not covered by the audio guide. My favourite part in this section was Qianlong garden, well worth a visit. In the top end of the garden were 2 small galleries/shops - the doors were closed as it was winter. This is off the main tourist track (I was the only one around) and I did not realise I could go in until a man came out and got me.

In this gallery I saw items that were more intersting than what was in the official gallery of treasures - these ones are for sale. Even my uneducated eyes could tell these were not the normal sort of gift shop tat; he said the museum has collected antiques for sale to raise money to maintain the palace - they are sold with a certificate of authenticity. The price tags run into the 1000s, which was beyond my means but I enjoyed looking. In many gift shops I see jade dragons, vases etc for sale for these prices - if you are planning on spending that kind of money on a souvenir from China I recommend avoiding the mass produced stuff and coming to this section of Qianlong garden for something of quality that could perhaps be genuine.

He then showed me to a gallery where I met the Emperors Nephew, a famous calligrapher who donates his time to raise money for the museum (I was shown brochures of his exhibitions to illustrate how important he was). He demonstrated drawing 4 characters on rice paper and stamped it, with what I was told was a very special and unique seal as only members of the imperial family can use such a stamp. I was then told that I could buy a personalised wall hanging, with good wishes and the chinese version of my family name, on pure silk, cost: 1500rmb, or I could have the rice paper version for 800rmb and frame it myself. I did not purchase anything and did some research afterwards. What I read says this is untrue as the Emperors only nephew is dead, and there are photos of different men playing this role. My advice is only buy one if you like the calligraphy and want a personalised souviner from a famous location that has an interesting story. In the giftshop near the exit I saw similar wall hangings for sale for 1700rmb - obvioulsy some people buy them; the one I was offered was of much higher quality and could be personalised.

If following the audio guide you will end up in the Imperial gargen which is near the exit at the north gate. It is worth going back down the east side of the palace to see the living quarters. You can see some artifacts through windows, but it is quite dim and the artifacts look quite dusty.

Practicalities: Sensible shoes as you will be walking for hours. There is seating areas inside and when I visited they were usually empty as it was too cold for people to sit long. I imagine that in the summer, with hoards of people, it may be difficult to find a place to rest. If you are visiting in winter then wrap up very warm with hat, gloves and scarf. 90% of you time is spent outside so you will feel COLD! I recommend bringing a flask with your own hot drink. You can purchase water for 4rmb, and cola for 5rmb, but hot drinks are expensive. Tea starts at 18rmb, coffee is 30rmb and the watery hot chocolate was not worth the 28rmb I paid for it.

Facilities: frequent toilets and lots of gift shops - they are numbered and I saw one called Gift Shop 30, so don't worry about not finding somewhere to spend your money. Most are located in the imperial garden. There are a few small eating places but especially as this is such a big complex it would be a good idea to carry your own drinks and snacks.

You have to exit at the north gate. Sign boards tell you which public buses you can get to go back to theh south entrance, or you can walk. Before you leave I recommend crossing the road to visit Jingshan park (entrance 2rmb). You can climb to the top of the hill and get a view of the whole of Forbidden City and other parts of the city. The view makes you appreciate just how big it is."
"The Forbidden City was the Chinese imperial palace from the Ming Dynasty to the end of the Qing Dynasty. Jin, or ""Forbidden"", referred to the fact that no one could enter or leave the palace without the emperor's permission. listed by UNESCO as the largest collection of preserved ancient wooden structures in the world. There’s really good wood and stone carvings. Almost every structure is colorfully painted wood and/or stone.

The place seems so large you can easily get lost. Take a water bottle as there is no place inside to get water."
"It wasn't my favorite, because after a while its just seems to be a lot of the same things. maybe if they had more artifacts or displays perhaps? Dont get me wrong, I loved it, and it will alwaysbe a memorable experience. But for some reason it just didn't wow me like so many other places I visited in China."
"Grand. Imposing. But should note the Opera house, maybe something overlooked but gives the context for opera beyond Italy."
"Forbidden City is the largest and best-preserved complex of ancient buildings in China. As its name suggested, the common people was forbidden to enter the Forbidden City in the ancient time.The buildings of the Forbidden City embody the artistic features and style of ancient Chinese architecture, and can be called a masterpiece in China, even world. Today, as the largest museum of cultural relics in China, the Forbidden City is also called Palace Museum. It is a must-see attractions for tourists to Beijing."
"... how anyone not drop in for a visit? Its a remarkable place, steeped in fascinating history, this was my second trip there, where I didn't allocate enough time in the first round. I still didn't allocate myself enough time this round too because we found even more things to see.

If you've doing this at your own time, go early and give yourself a day to spend there. It's ideal if you can speak a bit of chinese (I couldn't) because for all it's international connections, China is still a hermit state in some ways - evident with the funny English signs you may come across. It's sad there is such a gulf still between English & Chinese language, i think its reflective of way we still don't quite connect with each other.

However, this is an extremely beautiful place and a must see. With all credit to the Chinese Gov making all this available to be accessed for you and me."
"I had a few hours spare on a business trip and was very lucky to get to have a quick tour down the central avenue of the Forbidden City.

Being winter it was reasonably quiet. Even in the awful January smog/fog you can still see that this is an amazing historical site. I hired an audio tour for 40RMB - very well worth it to hear the history and what happened in the various buildings and what all the statues and thrones are for.
Lots of small facts provided like the huge cauldrons are actually for keeping firefighting water in and were heated in the winter to stop them freezing.

I will be back in Beijing later this year and will make sure I visit this site again. But I was still very glad to get a brief tour even if it the weather was very dull. I suspect it will be very busy and for the benefits I will hire a personal guide as recommended by other reviewers."
It was a great experience to see this wonderfully preserved heritage site. However the place was extremely crowded at that time. Good thing I was in a small group. If you are travelling with very young children please avoid this place.The toilets were horrible and far. Some of the other people there were sneezing and coughing without covering their mouths. Otherwise it was an unforgettable stop in my Beijing tour.
Another beautiful must see but after a while it all looks the same. Nice for some pictures. Was an enjoyable walk.
"The place is huge! It's called Forbidden City because during the Chinese Dynasties, the emperors lived there, with their wives (yes! many wives!) and their servants... and this place was forbidden to the people, it was only allowed for them.

They have plenty of palaces and you can see the bed where the emperor used to sleep. I'm afraid to say but my bed looks more comfy now... hehe! :)

Anyway, it's a must see in Beijing."
"Of all the Beijing palaces and monuments, this is by far the busiest and perhaps most well known. It is good to see it and to take the audio tour or have a professional guide. If I was short of time and could not visit everywhere, I would do summer palace instead."
"Do yourself a favour, and hire a private tour guide for this experience. We are a family of four (two daughters ages 7 & 9), and hired the guide through the hotel. He bought our tickets, expedited us through the lines, and gave us they much needed historical perspective that would have been lacking on our own. Skip the larger tour groups and get a personal guide for the Forbidden City. It's easily a 4 hour visit at a minimum. If in Beijing again, I would make a second visit without hesitation."
"You need to emerse yourself in the sheer majesty of the site and take on board whats laid out before you, it is beautifully preserved and when you consider when it was built the Chinese Government must be praised for the way they are preserving the site, just an unforgetable experience"
For those from non-asian countries the forbidden city offers a great insight into 'old asia'. It is hard to believe how long ago some of the structures were built and how well they have lasted. Do yorself a favour and grab an audio guide - the visit is more worthwhile when you understand more of what things were used for. By the time you get about halfway through it does all get a bit 'same same' but it is an interesting place. If travelling with little ones You can take your pram but it is not ideal - lots of rough terrain and stairs. There are ramps but sometimes hard to find and lots of little steps around - better to take a carrier if you can!
"Get ready to be amazed by this magnificent landmark in Beijing, take your time and drink lots of water to walk through this incredible place it will blow your mind."
"good place to visit, better with guide which speak english (easily to find at the entrance of the forbidden city). Use comfortable shoes"
"For all you hear about visiting Beijing and the bad air, it is still worth a visit to enjoy the Forbidden city. Hire a local guide to show you around and there are some that wait at the entrance gates to assist you. They really cleaned the Palaces up for the Olympics so go soon."
"Forbidden City in Beijing is a must see place!! It is huge so take your time, also we went in early November 2012, so it's a bit colder, you have to wear warm clothes. You cannot take it all in, it's not the same when you see it on TV, you will find it unbelievable. You can go with a tour guide or on your own, but have time to marvel. Do take some water because you will be walking quite a distance. Also have your camera ready. You will find many tourists and a lot of them will be Chinese, but try to get a english speaking tour guide to explain everything that happened in the Forbidden City. There is so much history. Take at least three hours to do the tour. We will review other attractions in Beijing that are MUST SEES, as well as a good centralized hotel in another article later."
"We were on a three week tour, both land and Yangtze River cruise in 2004. Joye was an excellent guide and those fortunate to get her will not regret it."
"Incredibly hugh place and you basically needed the whole day for this location if you wish to cover every corner of it. English explanation articles are outside every building so you don't really need a tour guide. It's more leisure to walk around alone but the map that they provided is a must if U didn't hire a tour guide.

Don't sting on the watch museum for watch lovers. U will never regret."
"What an incredible historic site that tells the story of dynasties, emperors, assassinations and the transition to modern China. The buildings show the classical ancient architecture and life of imperial China. Be careful of all the non-registered guides that approach you before you get to the ticket box. The only approved guides are pst the entry turnstiles and can be found at a small building on the left after going through the ticket entrance. We took an english tour guide (""he was called ""Hi"") and it was great to hear the history of the dynasties, the last emperor and the political transition plus gain a better understanding of how the city functioned and the purpose of various areas. We had 2 hours which wasn't enough. Probably need to allow a full half day to go through the city and up to the hill area."
"OK, this is one of those MUST stops and deservedly so. I've been on my own, with a friend, and as part of a group tour (Overseas Adventure Travel tour). Recommendation#1 the group tour will rush you through, one needs time to properly see the Forbidden City. Recommendation #2 know you are only seeing a portion of the place as to the west in a walled off (from the tourists) is the large section that is reserved for the residences of the government leaders. Recommendation #3 there is tendency after visiting the first three courtyards to go to the left or the right - I encourage visiting both areas but if there is time for only one, hang a right as that is where the smaller museums of clocks and jewelry are to be found, not to mention the well where the Dowager Empress had the emperor's concubine drowned. Looks of walking but well worth it."
"It's an amazing place, but I've been there in winter and it was a little bit too cold. If you are planning to go in winter too, be careful to take enough warm clothes.
It's a huge place so it may take a while to visit it all.
It's full of history and it worth it all!"
"I would definitely read up on the history and watch one of the many CD's before attending to fully understand what you are looking at. Even with a tour guide you need this background. It is VERY crowded, and we visited in November, which is off season. The architecture if beautiful"
One can go inside the forbidden city but not permitted to go inside various palaces. The doors are kept open for the visitors to view from the other side of the railings. Is a huge place but most places seems same for foreign tourists - as the building structures are same and with least architectural differences - all red in colour with some basic paintings.
"Dress warm for winter as you are outside the whole time. The ""tea house scam"" people are still out there looking for unsuspecting tourists. A friendly young couple approached us as we walked from the Mao Mausoleum through Tiananmen Square towards the entrance to the Forbidden City. They spoke English pretty well and walked along with us and asked a lot of questions. They told us that the Forbidden City was closed right now but would open in a couple hours and invited us to join them for tea. Now I had just read about this scam the previous day in a recent post here on Trip Advisor (see recent post for the details) so it was surreal to be targeted the very next day. The couple peeled off and ""headed to the tea garden"" right before we got near the entrance (where the police were).
We were then approached by an official guide who confirmed that they were scam artists.
Anyway enough on that. For anyone who has traveled much, you know to have heightened awareness near tourist locations and this situation would have raised alarms anyway.

We did hire a guide, which I found to be very helpful to understand what you are looking at, and the story behind the artifacts and buildings. Otherwise you are just looking at a lot of old buildings. Only some of the buildings have been restored, and many have not been cared for since 1912.
If you are a history buff this place will be inherently interesting. If you aren't that interested in history or just want to prep a bit you may want to watch the movie ""The Last Emperor"" before visiting to get an idea of what the place was all about at the very end of the reign of Emperors."
"Forbidden city is huge..really huge. it demands strong feet to explore the whole thing until the exit gates. I visited this place as a solo traveller. I didn't hire a guide although you can rent recorded tapes with multi languages (including mine: Indonesian). But since I'm more into taking pictures I just enjoyed the buildings, exploring the compound and watching people living in it. Some buildings still have some functions. On the exit gate on the back, some buildings seemed used by soldiers. Do explore the surroundings outside the compound near a river. Must visit but wear comfortable shoes and water !"
Went with the kids and they found it a boring (and they weren't quiet about it) just looking at buildings. Maybe we should have had a guide but I'm not sure this would have helped with the kids lack of interest factor.
"The city is a per guide books - big, iconic, fascinating and a must. For the tourist check out the souvenir shop at the far end. Just a bit different from the other things on offer everywhere else and good prices."
"I liked that the smog had moved out for our visit, that it being winter meant there were relatively few other tourists, and that we had a guide that gave us enough background information that so these sites, as well as others past now made sense. I recommend that the visitor spend some time reading about these sites before going to Beijing. I had done some, but plan to do more for future trips. Although there is some, English information is sketchy."
"I visited on a January Saturday and while it was chilly it wasn't too cold: wear layers to keep warm. It really wasn't too crowded with tourists and there seemed to be as many tour guides as tourists! I decided not to use a tour guide as I prefer to discover on my own and I'm not that interested in the historical background.

There was lots to see, if you like splendid buildings that evoke a sense of China's magnificent imperial past. But if you want to see relics like a museum, I found nothing like that.

There are plenty of toilets and food outlets, plenty enough for the number of visitors when I visited.

Before I came to China a friend told me that he found the Forbidden City rather boring, ""just lots of empty rooms"" was how he described it. Well I found it much more interesting and I recommend it to everyone to visit and see for themselves."
"Slippery and dead-set treacherous in places in the winter, but I guess there's not much they can do about ice. ALL the buildings can only be peered into from outside. It would be nice to be able to venture into some of them. This is the only gripe and there is still plenty to see to fill a day."
Its huge..covering large area in the heart of Beijing..One can understand and feel the history of Beijing and dynasties. It has many stories to tell the visitors..better you go with chinese tour guide..
"Take your time, there are numerous things to see here. The buildings are very large and the detail and art work is every ware. I had a tour guide with me so i was told what things were. If you don't have a tour guide you simply walk through it and have no knowledge of the history."
"How can someone go to China and mist this historical site. We enjoyed the visit with our friends. It is a very long walk and expect 2-3 hours min to almost visit everything. We loved the garden and we stay away from gift shops because a lot cheaper going to the Silk Market and get 1/10th of the price.,"
"We have been there in April, its nice but like every spot in China very crowded. And you will see that the forbidden city wasnt constructed for a lot of poeple! The square in front is very impressive though"
"The size of this place is incredible, huge courtyards and more things to see than you could imagine. Even on a Thursday in the middle of winter there were thousands of people here. I would definitely suggest hiring a guide as you come in to the gate. They are everywhere and will approach you . For the 5-10 dollars it is worth it. I went back a second time just to travel around without the guide and just walked around and shot photos.

This place is so huge you will just be overwhelmed with the sheer size of the place."
"The Imperial Palace is a must see. Home of the richest Chinese Emperors, the Palace is a non stop amazement. Make sure your guide can be understood or you miss interesting information. Take water, snacks and an umbrella for protection against the sun. It is worth a visit back again."
This place is much bigger than we had anticipated. The walk through is long but very rewarding. The knowledge that Katrina showed on the history and details of the city were amazing and made to one of the most rewarding visits on our trip.
"I know I may get hate mail from this review. Of course you have to see the Forbidden City when visiting Beijing. After all, it is very old and historical. Just be prepared that it is a little anti-climactic. It is very big and a little bit redundant and always, always very crowded. I really appreciated the garden and the mote at the back entrance. To see a birds eye view of the Forbidden City (the best way to see it in my book) climb Coal Hill behind the Forbidden City."
"I went to this place along with my wife and 2 kids. we went there in first week of February 2012.
There was extreme cold and the water was frozen.
This place is a place where old kings of China used to stay . There are many rooms and the place is huge , There was large quantity of chinease people enjoying there holiday there.
This place is a must visit for anybody travelling to beijing."
"Any trip to Beijing should include the Forbidden City. Once you get through the area prior to the ticket gate, it is a wonderful attraction. The ""I want to be your guide"" people prior to the ticket gate will be constantly asking you to hire them as a guide and the so called ""art students"" will have a display to show you but just keep walking. Once inside, you will see the beautiful buildings and explore the side wings as they lead to so many more buildings. we spent 4.5 hours just wandering and reading the information signs in english. Enjoy as we did."
We walked around the Forbidden city for hours & still did not see it all. A wonderful piece of history and culture. Well worth a visit.
"Go early, take a private guide and be prepared to be impressed. This place is huge, there is so much to see and learn about. Nothing here is done on a small scale. We used Catherine Lu as our guide, her English is great and her knowledge of The Forbidden City is extensive."
In Beijing if you are going to see one thing in town this is it. It is central downtown with Tien an men square in front and you start with a gate that is hge and detailed. as you enter and move from square to square deeper into this 386 hectare site you can't help but feel the sheer power and unlimited funds that were available to the emperors of old. It is impossible to give it justice in writing because of all of the details and history. should be on everyones bucket list!
one thing about china its very clean and organised. well maintained. the only thing annoying is the constant spitting and blowing your nose with out a tissue..... gross
"We vistied in winter and appreciated the small crowd.
In Winter you should be dressed well: only souvevnier shops are (somewhat) heated."
"This place is so big, and quite amazing to see. It makes Buckingham Palace look like a shack!
The advantage of being here in January is that there are very few people."
"Fascinating history and beautiful buildings. Tip - visit China in the winter, when there are fewer tourists and visits to sites like the Forbidden City can be relaxing as well as enjoyable."
"The Forbidden City is of course a ""must see"" for any first-time visitor to Beijing. The architecture is very interesting and the gigantic size of the palace and grounds is mind-boggling. Unfortunately it is probably always fairly crowded, but likely to be more so over weekends. We visited early on a Saturday morning in late October and it already very crowded - difficult to take photos avoiding the crowds. Regardless, a most interesting visit and one can probably spend an entire day there easily if one wants to study things in detail."
"Beijing has been the capital of China for the past ~800 years. The forbidden palace is one of the top tourist sites. The scale is massive and you need to prepare to walk a lot. Mostly buildings there and exhibits are few as they are mostly stolen / transported out to overseas.

Tips
1. arrive early to avoid the crowd - lots of both domestic and international tourists there.
2. it is advisable to spend some money and hire the automatic guide, as when you are close to a spot it will play the comment for that spot - very convenient."
I loved this place and could have spent days here I think. I found it so interesting and all the work and history that this place has is amazing. I was sorry that I didn't go to the Hutong's though as they are now becoming trendy little art places....
Didn't realize that the Forbidden City was such a large place! It took a long time to walk through it and I was glad that we went through with a guide. Most of the place was refurbished for the Olympics but even the parts that weren't are spectacular.
"Beijing is a great city for setting out on your own in that the streets all run east west and north south laid out like every city should be. So it wasn't difficult getting from the Dong Fang Hotel to the main entrance of the city. There was a bit of a line up at the ticket booth just outside the main entrance but considering the crowd...and this was midweek in May... it moved quite fast.
The city itself is perfectly squared off and the movement of tourists is mainly straight through the middle as the many buildings towards the sides are still undergoing restoration. I don't know why so many people whine about the place not being maintained as it looked okay to me considering it was built over six hundred years ago. It can be seen in under two hours at a leisurely pace while snapping off a few dozen photos. Its true that the many buildings have a similar appearance but still it is quite interesting from an architectural and historical standpoint.
The only thing I didn't like was the lack of written description for the various rooms which could only be viewed from a series of wide doors.
It is without doubt the most important tourist site within the city of Beijing and not to be missed."
In you go during wintertime please be very very careful with your layers. It gets really cold and you have to walk a lot so get good boots and cover up.
"soo crowded, hot in summer, very huge palace, you cannot imagine the scale of this place before you see it.. ok but not fabulous place.."
"Be prepared to be amazed. This place is just incredible. I can't adequate describe it in words but as an indication, I took aver 400 photos in 4 hours! Just when you think you've seen it all, through the next gate is something even more stunning. Bring some comfy walking shoes and a camera. Get there early to avoid the throngs of megaphone waving tour operators. You have to leave your bags in lockers in some areas and you cannot take liquids inside the gates. enter from the south and exit from the north. If possible try to explore the less travelled eastern and western parts of the city. You can also hire a electronic tour guide (45 yuan each) in various languages They claim they are GPS enabled but neither of ours worked properly so I'm not sure they were much value. Just when you think you have reach the north gate, you enter an amazing garden. You need at least 2 hours for a quick walk through, 4 hours to do most of it and probably a full day to really experience all of it. We felt very privileged and humbled to visit this exquisite site."
I guess that I travelled too much in my life do that this place did not impress me. I just made a stop over in Beijing because I wanted to see the great wall. The (forbidden) city alone is not worth the journey. :-(
"There were a lot of people even on a cold winter day! Definitely a tourist spot. If you are into history, you may enjoy the stories about the Forbidden City. However, after you see a couple of the buildings, they all become the same. I would say go if you must cross it off your list of ""tourist to-dos"" in Beijing."
"If you are going to Beijing, one of the ""must do's"" is to stop by and see the Imperial Palace. We were there in late December when it was pretty cold and I was shocked to see how crowded it was (so in nice weather, it must be insane!) I don't know... I thought I'd be more impressed with this site. The buildings were interesting, but the entry fee was a bit pricey for China. It's one of those things I just check off my ""checklist"" and wouldn't need to see again."
One of the places to go when you're in Beijing but we tend to spend there for a good 30mins only. Its sad that they don't really maintain the place.
"I COPIED PASTE (AND CHANGED WHERE NECESSARY) ANOTHER TRAVELER`S EXPERIENCE WHO HAD IN 2010 A SIMILAR EXPERIENCE TO OURS LAST WEEK IN BEIJING:

I was traveling with my fiancee on Tiannamen square and were looking forward to visiting the fabulous forbidden city when a young couple walked up along side us and began chatting in a casual but friendly manner using very good English. They told us they were friends, visiting Beijing from a southern city in China. Things were going nicely and I was quite impressed to which extent they were knowledgable about Europe on several different topics - we slowly but surely began to think we had made some new Chinese friends. It was a very cold day in January, and our new friends suggested we go get a tea house before visiting the forbidden city together. ""What a great idea!"" we said, ""We ve been wanting to experience a real Chinese tea house."" We set ourselves up perfectly for what came next.

We walked around the corner and up a tree-lined street, when we came across a small tea house, seemingly at random. We went inside into a small salon where a table was prepared for tea tasting. There were different teas and some bowls of treats to go along with the tea. We were really enjoying ourselves, and whilst there were no price anywhere, we really were thinking: tea, it would only be a few RMB, isn`t it?

At the end of the service, the bill came and it was a shock! We knew there had to be a mistake as the total was 1000 RMB, which is about $150 USD!! We went through the bill. First of all there was a calculation error which led to a reduction of 600RMB! But even 400RMB (which would make 100RMB per person) was still a lot (considering a tall cappuccino at starbucks would cost here around 40 maximum!).

The conversation went sour and we felt very uncomfortable. We decided to leave 100RMB on the table which was already a good price for what we had been offered, and our chinese friends made us feel even more guilty by adding 100RMB to compensate what we refused to pay! At the end of the day, we left the place and refused to pay more!

It was only afterwards that we realized we had been duped. A little research on the internet shows this to be a common scam in China, not only in Beijing, but also in Shanghai, etc. Our so called ""friends"" had expertly guided us to this particular tea house and presumably afterwards got paid a kickback on the sale. We felt like a dope. Of course, after we did some research, I now know we were not the first and certainly won't be the last to fall victim to this scam. We are just a human being after all, and look for the best in others, not the worst.

So, read this tale and beware of the friendly stranger on Tianamen Square who would guide you to a nearby tea house for refreshments. Ask for the pricing beforehand and don't be afraid to get up and walk out. Also, good to know (afterwards that sounds fishy as well), it was one of the only places (apart from hotels) where they accepted visa and mastercard (in China, unionpay system is more used and they do not accept visa in most places)."
"It is a very large attraction and will take many hours to cover. The buildings were very beautiful with intricate exterior details. However, it is quite disappointing when you look inside the buildings. For some reason I just cannot understand, there was no upkeep what-so-ever in the interior of the buildings. For example, we looked into this large structure (we were not allowed to go inside, just look in from outside) where, supposedly, the King frequented since some of his favorite concubines lived there and what we saw were walls that looked spotty gray with mold, furniture were in disarray and shockingly there was duct tape on the mattress in the nicely carved wooden bed. A few of the building interior looked something like that so we just stopped trying to look inside. We could not believe it. The attraction itself was very nice and was very pleasing to the eyes."
You may as well go as you're in Beijing and it would be weird but its OK. You can't go in anywhere and in comparison to other places it's not as nicely kept and really that not impressed. But it'd be like to going to Paris and not seeing the Eiffel Tower!
"It's huge and beautiful,especially at night or in the evenning.but it's cloudy that day(beijing thing,hah) so it looks not so nice with too many people(that day is chinese 's national day)"
"bring your walking shoes, hire a tour guide for a better understanding of the architecture. It is a lot bigger than expected."
"Glad we had the services of a guide. The city is just magical - so much for one ruler!
In January it was cold but thin crowds that made it possible to really explore the multitude of streets, buildings and yards."
Its the center of the world when it comes to imperial dynasties of China. Truly a great house (well at the end of the day it is a house).
"Liked: Everything. It's a great place to have a view of how China was in it Imperial Ages
Dislike: The crowd is too big!"
"If you need an English guide, do the research ahead of time and hire one who can speak good English and get a good overview of the place. I went back a few days later and just spent time wandering around on my own."
"the architecture is second to none. wow, the years it took to build this! it was indescribable the feeling of aweness when you're walking the grounds.

Definitely worth the time to put on your sneakers and spend a couple of hours there."
"yet another Beijing treasure, to think the city was for really built for one person its quite difficult for a westerner to comprehend, the attention to detail in every aspect is amazing, a place I will revisit again most definitely"
"We had a wonderful guide, Grace, from Chinatours. The forbidden city is very interesting and historic. Be prepared for lots of walking over uneven ground. Well worth the time."
It's huge and so much to see. It helps to have a guide provide some information because there are so many buildings. Little things like the color of the roof to the eaves have meaning.
"This was the imperial palace during the Ming and Qing dynasties and the buildings are really impressive. Every building has a gate built in the same oriental style which i love. They all have names like Hall of Supreme Harmony, Hall of Heavenly something or the other and after a while you forget which one you saw. The bridges are also fabulous Marble arch masterpieces. But a must see if in Beijing. We went in December and it was -7 C and bloody freezing."
"I think working out what to do and see was the hardest, when you get there go to the left for tickets, by the entrance for the voice over. I stayed on the quick path through because it was very cold in the courtyards with the Jan wind chill, I spent most of my time looking at the building details and painted wood fantastic. I could have spent a day but was so cold I saw all I wanted in 2 hours. There was nothing of quality to buy in the shops in the city so I did not bother and did not go to an art exhibition 'I had been warned'. Buts still an amazing place to see."
"The place is really crowded, but it's just like the movies. Definitely a place to see! :) Huge open areas so sun protection is a must!"
"The Forbidden City entrance is adjacent it Tiananmen Square, so if you visit the Square, you'll want t add the Forbidden City to your destination list. There is a fair bit of walking so be prepared. We visited in late December, and although it was brutally cold, there were still quite a lot of tourists visiting the City. If I had it t do over again, I would opt for the warmer weather. The washrooms are the place to go to get warm when it's cold outside. Also, we had a private tour guide who was very good, to give us the history behind the city, and explain the significance of several of the artifacts and structures we saw. It is a place with a visit, but will take some time to walk through."
"Something we had to do while we were there. It would be better done in a group tour with an English-speaking tour guide. Avoid people trying to sell anything (eg antiques, calligraphy arts, etc) at all cost. Too many rip-off antics going on in that place. Such a shame as it spoils the memory of experience of having been there."
"We went in winter time so it wasn't very crowded. The fee is very low for a place like this and there's a lot to see! Don't forget to visit the treasury. Not exactly for the display but the area itself is very beautiful and during our visit almost empty.
Of course you can;t imagine how it was in the days that it was habitated but nevertheless it's still one of the most beautiful and peaceful places in Beijing which is converted in a modern metropolis filled with traffic and noise."
"Have you ever watch ""The Last Emperor"" movie? I love that film and watch it again and again. I don't know why. So when I arrived Beijing in a cold and windy day, I'm very happy to take a tour with a friendly and kind guidetour name Achin. The explanation is very clear because she using Bahasa Indonesia very well, so the tour members could understand anything about the Palace. Even the Imperial Palace itself looks cold, had similarity and unfurnished, but I still love to walk around the palace, feels the air and dream about the ancient era. I think you should have a communicative guidetour so you can feel the same way. I think I should re-watch the film again tonight! Hohoho....."
"The actual buildings themselves in the Forbidden City are amazing and the history is very interesting. I didn't find it very interesting walking into the different halls, museums, etc as they items in there were not that interesting and there was not that much information in there. You also can't actually walk into a lot of the buildings and can only peer in and see."
"even with a great guide, it is slightly boring. most rooms are cold, empty and dark. it felt extremely spiritually empty when compared to even mayan ruins where you can feel the spirits there. this had none of that. i didnt get to the museum part which hopefully is better. kids will probably hate this unless you let them run around to get lost. waste of time. nothing like the american white house or british palaces. this was emtpy and blah"
"I hate to be so jaded about such an important historical place but I felt mostly underwhelmed at this venue.

It's hard to imagine what it may have looked like in its heyday. Paint is mostly fading and the place has an abandoned feel. You'll walk and walk and walk through building after building with a huge crowd of people on what feels like an endless march to view the exterior of one mostly empty building after another. There is very little left in the site except for a few furnishings which are difficult to see behind glass. No interpretive activities are included that I could find. No effort is made to bring the history back to life on the part of site managers.

The entire site felt stone cold and lifeless. Is it because we visited during the winter when everything is miserably frozen and dead? Maybe.

At the end of the day, all I can say is that I have been there and that it is enormous. I was, sadly, not inspired and I truly wanted to be."
It was cold. The feet got frozen very soon. The toilet was a good place to warm up. Still need to fight with the crowd to see inside the palaces despite the cold weather
"Absolutely fantastic! Of all the historic monuments and places I have been to, I would rate the Forbidden City as one of the top 10! Have to watch The Las Emperor again!"
"Beautiful city. We got the audio tour which I think is a must, learned a lot more than just wandering around. Only took an hour or two, so can fit it in to another tour in the city."
"We enjoyed the Forbidden City but it was extremely cold the day we went. You have to walk to it because taxis are not suppose to stop on the road in front of it. I think this is because it is across the street from Tienenamen Square and all the political offices. So be prepared to walk and this too, requires a ticket purchase to get to the inner buildings. Beware of engaging with the street vendors because they are relentless and will follow you, mercilessly to see you a hat, or cards, or a book, etc."
"Understandably the building is all but stripped of its furniture. However the important throne rooms still have the essential emoluments. Its a big place to walk through so wear comfortable shoes and bring water to avoid dehydration.

One thing i noticed is that uniformed and plainclothes police are aplenty so you feel secure. Its as if no pickpocket would dare prow these areas. Its an open area mostly so the sun is very hot which is why fall or winter would be the best time to visit."
"Seeing the Forbidden City was wonderful. I had no idea how huge the complex is. You walk through several courtyards and then you realize those are all ""outer"" courtyards and you still have several more to go before you reach the inner city.

As a function of its popularity, it was insanely crowded. Tour group after tour group pushed you through the different temples. What was wonderful was going to the Hall of Clocks and Treasure Gallery because, in addition to having gorgeous objets d'art, the tour groups didn't take time to go there so it was possible to enjoy them without hoards of other tourists."
"Forbidden City

no open on Monday afternoon every week, this will last until 31of March 2013, 11 o'clock, it stops selling tickets. The other days no problem.

This 7th, I went there in the afternoon, then I suffered that it was not open....

It stops opening because of renovation, it says."
"We visited in the winter season, all areas covered with snow! It is very beautiful! All historical place within this palace compound is amazing."
"Went to Beijing in July 2012 and did a tour of the Forbidden City. It was really hot and humid that day but it well worth putting up with the heat to look around the Forbidden City. There were quiet a lot of people there (mainly tourists) and you had to wait in a long line in the heat to get tickets. Once you got through the line you could go in a have a look at the different exhibitions they had on! We went in one that showed clocks from all around the world from the 17-21st century. I recommend speeding about 5 hours to get in, look around and eat. Overall, the Forbidden City was awesome!"
"We didn't use a guide but bought the audio guide at the entrance which is very clever & let's you walk around and explore at your own pace. The city is huge so wear good walking shoes! It was like walking through a history book, so much to see and learn about. It was a very cold day so we didn't stay as long as we would have liked but we managed to see most of it. If you are any way interested in history you must visit this place."
"The Forbidden should not be missed by any visitor to Beijing. Though at can be very crowded at Sundays the complex is worth visiting. View the movie ""The last Emperor of China"" first, it helps enormously to understand the importance and uniqueness."
"The Forbidden City is majestic! We went in the winter, so we avoided huge crowds. The gardens are beautiful, even with snow covering.

The audio guide has built in GPS so you don't need to push any buttons. Like most audio guides, some of the information is interesting and some you could live without.

There are street vendors hawking their wares, and a gift shop where you can buy the cutest bobble head emperor and empress-one of the more adorable souvies I picked up in China!

A must see tourist spot-don't forget to take your photo in front of Chairman Mao!"
a must to visit when you travel to Beijing; disappointed that so much still needs to be restored and that so much was never preserved or taken care of adequately; amazing at how large of an area it encompasses - be sure to leave enough time to visit
"Sure it si big, and impressive but it didn't grow on my that much. A lot of similar houses on a big spot with an amazing history behind it"
"The buildings, the story and reliving the movie The Last Emperor in my head.

The audio-guides have improved and they are now slightly bigger than a hotel key card. They have them in almost all the languages. The audio guides work with GPS so only when you stand in front of something worth mentioning will the audio come back on; so much better than having a never ending ramble; money well spent at RMB40 which is about $6 USD.

SPITTING!!! Yuccck!!! I know spitting is a major issue in China; everywhere. I know I was there in the dead of winter when everyone has a cold. I know, that it is a national sport but it simply seems that after the Olympics the gusto for deep drawn coughing up spit has rekindled. You either run to avoid being spit on or step on it everywhere. Someway, somehow, someone should make spitting in such a historically venerable place as the Forbidden City or Tianamen, or any Palace, even at the Great Wall, illegal. It's just not cool."
What an experience! This is a sedate stroll back through time and seeing what people achieved in beautiful buildings is quite humbling. The East Gate is shut at the moment for renovation and you enter the city through the South Gate. There are toilets here so use them as there are none in the City itself. You go through the Gate - be prepared for pressure to buy a guided tour - you honestly will not need it - so a firm no a dozen or so times does eventually get you left alone! Take your time as you move through and do get move to the doorways and glance inside the buildings - it is well worth the wait for your turn. Keep moving through and you eventually exit through the North Gate. At this point beware!!! You run the gauntlet of pressure selling - people will literally be in your face - so get a wiggle on! Head down and charge. This is a trip you shouldn't miss.
"When in Beijing the Forbidden Palace and Tinnamen Square have to be on your list of sites to see. During our Viking River cruise of China, Beijing was our last stop. We came in late September, first week of October and the weather was perfect. The crowds seemed a bit more manageable which added to the pleasure of the trip. Touring the grounds and buildings was wonderful, as part of Viking you are provided with earphones and a transmitter that allows you to hear you guide while having complete freedom to roam. I really enjoyed all of the photo ops and hearing the narration from our guide as I broke out on my own to get some amazing photos. This is a piece of history and I was thrilled to experience it first hand. A must see when in China!"
"There were a quarter of million people who visited on the golden week in October. Avoid these days, it's crazy. Go in the middle of the week, while China is not on holiday and preferably not in the peak tourist season. The palaces are interesting and many of the guides brings it all alive to give you a possibility to understand the grandeur. This is the 2nd thing you must see in Beijing after the Summer Palace."
"My husband and I took this day tour with Jackie Lee and another family. It was a massive area with lots of walking which was great except it was so cold. We were all cold but he kept the pace quick and we were able to see all the sights. We were surprised that the buildings were closed and you could only view from the porches. Jackie was very funny, interesting and full of facts and history lessons. We also went to the Silk factory, Pearl museum and lunch at a typical Chinese restaurant. Jackie was very attentive and made our day very special with lots of photos and information."
"The Forbidden City is a breath-taking place, it is a huge and you need at least 2 hours to see it all. There are so many people at the entrance of the palace trying to sell you stuff, DO NOT BUY because they are charging you 10 times more than the actual price.

Highly recommended!!!!!!!!"
"We got a bad experience on a rickshaw at the exit side of the forbidden city. The driver ended up changing driver on the way where two other locals demanded 600 RMB instead of the 30 RMB agreed. Also, they left us on a Hutong in the middle of nowhere. We were just glad to leave the place safe and sound and glad we had the money demanded and nothing else was demanded. Don't use these rickshaws. A shame these people don't understand how much they damage their own reputation. This experience just taught us not to trust anybody around. A shame for the general population, I am sure,"
"Nothing prepares you for the sheer size of the Imperial Palace it is breath-taking. It seems to go on for ever - through gates, over bridges - 9,999 rooms! Quite difficult because of the crowds to see inside the rooms."
"We went there on Thursday December 27 in the morning and there where no crowds at all (if you look at the picture you can see how many people where there). We got to see everything we wanted to see and enjoyed all the history.
The buildings do all look alike but if you take time and read the signs you can understand what they where used for."
"I'm a fan of Chinese martial-arts movies. So when I went here, my imagination was all over the place. From Bruce Lee and Jackie Chan doing Kung Fu to imperial royalties passing by to Chinese monks in prayer.

It's a great place to visit. Too bad there are many people, I'm too shy for a solo photo with a kung-fu pose!

When you go here, make sure you have plenty of time. Around 3hrs or so..
I almost missed my flight because I thought I can have an hour trip here. (Big mistake!)
Once you enter the Forbidden City, the ONLY exit is on the other side. You will need to pass numerous gates with different attractions. Not to mention the crowd slowing down your pace.

MUST BRING: Bottled Water, Hat, Walking Shoes, Picnic Blanket or portable chair for resting"
"I've brought friends here a few times and each time I think the same...this is a boring place as all the buildings are empty. At any rate, if you visit, be sure to start on the Tainanmen square side and work from that side to the back. Otherwise you will be walking though all backwards and that way it is totally unimpressive."
"Take note that its not all that easy to double back and explore things. If you see something that you may want to see, go see it. Don't figure you'll see it on the way back or later. The whole experience is a long walk and by the time you pass something you'll probably find something else that will prevent you from going back. That said, this is a very cool experience. Sure, some can nit-pick as to the condition of certain items, but the architecture/design/layout are very impressive. This is definitely a must-see when in Beijing. I'm considering going back when I return in 2 months just to see what I may have missed on this trip.

There are a ton of vendors and 'independent tour guides' trying to get you to spend your money, but once you get past the paid entrance they're all gone. Much more relaxed and easy going.

If you see someone selling 5RMB english tour guide books, skip it. They basically reprint a bunch of what is on the signs inside. Wish I had know that before. Oh well, not that much out of pocket."
"Going to Beijing and not going to the Forbidden City would be like going to Washington, DC and not visiting the mall with the Lincoln Memorial and the Washington Monument. It's an amazing place that absolutely must be visited. The size and the layers to the city are quite impressive."
It is a huge palace. Take a English audio guide on rent. Before going there check the entrance gate location. Not many English sign boards are available.Try to avoid going on week ends and public holidays.
"This place just goes on and on. Gate after gate after building after building, and they all look alike, there's nothing much to see since the treasures were mostly removed to Taiwan by Chiang-Kai Shek decades ago, and the day we were there the crowds were oppressive. Very pushy and rude. Impacted our experience negatively. Once you get out to the North side though, there's a beautiful garden and the moat around that side is lovely and peaceful. A must-see but be prepared to walk a lot and possibly fight crowds."
"From the outside the Forbidden city looks so small. Even a map can not show the majestic size of this wonderful city. You could wander through there for days and still manage to find something new around every corner. It is often very busy there so patience is key but other then that you can enjoy amazing architecture, and tons of history. Yet another amazing piece of China that will never be forgotten."
A true wonder of the medieval world. It is well preserved and still very cheap to go in. In winter it is particularly impressive if very cold.
"We had a private tour guide, which was well worth it, as she explained much of the history of the royal family, as well as many of China's customs and beliefs, which are integral to the design and architecture of the Forbidden City. There is much to see, and we barely brushed the surface with a two-hour tour, but it was enough to get a good sense of the place and see many parts of it.
Warning: We were invited in to see the reading room of the last emperor, and a descendent of his family was there, offering Chinese calligraphy on scrolls for purchase. We were pressured to buy something, since the descendent ""volunteers his time"" to the palaces, but the prices were astronomical ... more than we paid for a full-day private tour with guide. We politely refused, but the pressure kept mounting, with the price decreasing slightly and the guilt trip increasing significantly. We finally just turned and walked away, thanking them for the time. We later bought some Chinese calligraphy for 100 Yen at one of the markets, not done by a royal descendent but nice nevertheless and much cheaper."
"As I said about the temple of heaven. Both venues are amazing, I just wish the restorations had been more authentic. The areas that are old are fantastic, but other areas look like they were just built"
It was very nice and well preserved. There was also a lot to see there and lots to do there it also had a lot of things from the time of ancient china. But the bad part was it was very crowded and it was a long walk but there was so much to see in such a big palace I absolutely loved it.
"What a place to visit. There are plenty of flag wavers with megaphones, who seem to be in a race to get their group through as quickly as possible. Not only are the main halls and palaces a must see, but do make the effort to look at the smaller halls either side. Very few flag wavers here."
I've had the great fortune to visit three times to this place and always enjoyed wondering around this vast complex. Move off from the central thorough fare and you can find quiet little courtyards to explore by yourself.
"We recently visited the Forbidden City, and although the weather was freezing (-12) we still found this attraction to be well worth the effort. The detail of the craftsmanship in these building is beyond belief. Very glad we made the effort on this freezing day!!"
"Beautiful but you can't access or see many rooms. The rooms that are open you can only peak onside from the door. It was very icy but the workers did a good job of removing the ice. I would definitely recommend paying the 10¥ extra to see the treasury area. It's not only the treasury but you get to enter the area where the emperors parents lived, you get to see a lot moe rooms, temples and interiors, including a pecking opera theater."
"I did this as a tour through Grey Line on my first day in Beijing. My tour guide Shine was terrific and he made Chinese history come alive. Make sure you wear good walking shoes and bring your camera because this place has plenty of photo opportunities. I went in November and it was already pretty chilly so make sure you bring correct clothing. You will spend a lot of time outside. My tour was early in the morning which was good since it was already pretty crowded.

My biggest suggestion is to do this on a tour. You will get a much better sense of the history than trying to figure it all out alone. The one downside to this tour (and every tour I took in China) was the stops for looking at local ""products"". While I did not buy anything there is the feeling of some pressure. That said it is still worth doing. I would also suggest reading up on some Chinese history before you go. Hope you all have as good a time as I did."
"I think seeing the Forbidden City is an absolute must when in Beijing. I absolutely loved walking around visiting all the different halls and areas, crossing the bridges and just marvelling at the sheer scale of everything. Allow a good couple of hours for this trip...even more if you really want to take a good look at absolutely everything!! I particularly enjoyed the hall with the clocks in (can't remember its proper name). But overall it's just the size and scale and history of the place that leaves the biggest impression.

We hired out the automatic audioguides and they were fairly informative but quite temperamental! I was with two other people and we all ended up listening to different things at different times. Also this sounds silly but the woman on the English version has a fairly boring voice.

You have to queue to get tickets and since we went in the height of summer we have to wait quite a long time. If you plan on going in the summer I'd advise putting on a lot of suncream and wearing a hat or carrying an umerella to protect you from the sun. Also take some cold water to keep yourself hydrated! There is a shop in there where you can top up but it isn't the easiest to find. Also be aware that in peak times it gets extremely busy.

Definitely recommended - just make sure you plan it well and set aside a good couple of hours for it!"
"Amazing conditions - some of it has been repainted fairly recently for the Olympics, some of it not. Either way it is very impressive and beautiful. Very crowded, even in December, when most other tourist locations are not."
Our timing for this trip wasn't great. It was snowing and the ground was really slippery decreasing our enjoyment of the attraction tenfold. The palace is amazing with so much history. A must see for a trip to Beijing. I just a good pair of snow boots if traveling in winter. It's quite busy on the weekend and I would suggest a weekday visit instead.
"I always wanted to see the forbidden city as from my school days I had been hearing of its subduedly proclaimed magnificience.the entrnace was crowded but orderly.The entrance into the courtyard is too good to be described in words( so I have picture for you).The typical ti;ed roofs are sght to see, so are the brightly colored designs.
The stone sculpted statues of the lions,dragons and all other mythical figures are worth seeing.
ll the royal familys belongings and artefacts are on thoughful display,but unless you are tall like me it will be difficult to peekin and see as was the problem faced my my shorter colleague.
It takes time,patience and some emergy to really see the entire place but is worth it."
"i went to The Forbidden City on my second last day in Beijing. We went in the afternoon and it was quite packed with people, but reall the layout is huge so there was still enough space to get around. Maybe early morning would be the go if you prefer to try beat the crowds. My guide took care of the tickets, so i cant say how much it was, needless to say it was cheap. The place is huge and everything an Emperour could have wanted. I was taken through and stopped at all the major rooms, bit tough to get picks but be patient yet assertive. The grounds around the rooms are quite amazing with the dragon statues everywhere. Photo opportunities abound. There are small kiosks for snacks and drinks around if you need something to keep you going. the final temple on the hill at the end is great as it gives you a better idea how big the complex is, HUGE. To go more in depth you probably would like at least two days devoted to the Palace, i had an afternoon which was still awesome. Enjoy!!"
"I was so excited to see the Forbidden City. It was beautiful and interesting. However, My Knowledge of Chinese history is limited. I would have benefited by watching a movie, such as Hidden Tiger Crouching Lion or The Last Emperor, before visiting. The fall is a great time to visit because it is not too busy or hot."
"If you only have a chance to do two things while in Beijing, The Forbidden City would have to be on that list, and The Great Wall would be my second suggestion. We were here in October, during Chinese National Holiday Week, and the crowds were gargantuan. It took us the entire day to see what we did see here, which was by no means everything, simply because of the enormity of the crowds. Nonetheless, no matter how great the crowds, this is a place you have to see at least once in your lifetime. Imagine the time not too long ago when the Forbidden City was not accessible. Now it is open for public view and what a sight it is. The most spectacular architecture, the most beautiful roof lines, the colors of the buildings, of the roof tiles, there was a significance and meaning to everything here. Even the very first phone in China was installed for the Emperor, and you can still see it today. This is one of the attractions that you will think about for a long time after your visit. Not to be missed."
"There has been so much history based on the forbidden city, and it was definitely a highlight of Beijing for us. The whole palace is really well maintained, we went right after heavy snow and the palace was already well swept and clear paths were everywhere. All of the places had English captions and the staff at the palace was very friendly. We didn't want to pay the ¥40RMB for the talking tour, but we still managed fine and had a great time.
We got to the palace from Tiananmen East station on line 1 and walked through Tiananmen gate to get to the palace. The place was just so magnificent and we are still in awe. It was a pity that since it was winter, parts of the palace was not open, and be aware of the opening times, as we spent a whole day there without realising."
"Its a great experience of what Beijing was like in the old days.
Avoide the touts who pitch guiee services at you. instead rent the audio headset that guides you through the walk explaining where you are and what the location was used for. Catch the subway triain ther, if you tour the city in a circle you can come back to the place where you entered and catch the subway back to your point of origin. You should buy any gifts in the markets and not in the overpriced city. Download a free forbidden city map on the internet so you wont fel the need to buy one there."
A must see. Only wish I had more time to take in the beauty. I'd encourage anyone to learn the history before going or hire a guide for the tour. I'll let my photos tell the rest of the story.
"Beautiful sample of Chinese architecture, my remark is this place must be a place to enjoyable walking but crowds don´t allow.
But a suggest a visit anyway."
Another must see if your in Beijing. The amazing forethought in the design and contruction and just the enormaous size of these buildings will leave you in awe. A memory to last a lifetime and make you want to see more.
"I won t tell you how impressive the Forbidden City is. Just some advice. Start with the visit of Tiananmen, then visit the Forbidden City from south to north And finish with the Jingshan Park to enjoy the view !"
We visited Beijing to visit my daughter and grandchildren the forbidden city is awe inspiring but be beware of the guides who offer to show you round some will try to charge you a fortune best to go around yourself it is worth the scrum to see some of the rooms make sure you have your passport with you in case the police ask to see it.And go to the toilet before you go out they are squat toilets with no locks on the doors. if you are blue eyed like myself expect to be stared at take a pair of sunglasses with you it can get uncomfortable this was the only place I really encountered this but be warned. also expect people to spit on the ground they do this any where in Beijing.
"I found the Chinese people quite helpful and friendly, unlike some of the reviews. Rather packed
with people. There is a gold statue of one of the emperors in the palace. Very picturesque and took quite a few photos. I also liked Shanghai and the Yu Gardens and Shanghai museum and would recommend the Great Wall and the Seven Star park with its wonderful floodlit caves."
"You would need several days to visit all the buildings and houses in the Imperial City.
It is very well preserved, magnificient and explanations are quite OK for each building. Don't miss the libraries, you can buy fantastic souvenirs"
"I thought this was a bit disappointing really, given how everyone puts it at the top of their list of places to visit.
Starting from the south (Tian'anmen GAte), after you've fended off several blokes offering to be your guide, you then traipse past an interminable number of largely identical Palace of Somethingly Somethings with thrones inside. All a bit lethal with added snow and ice, as I had when I was there.
Finally you get to the nice bits - the Imperial Gardens at the northern most edge (beautiful!) and the big rockery bit in the middle of it. And there are plenty of souvenirs to buy if that's your sort of thing.
For an extra few yuan, you can go off to the eastern side for the nine-dragon mural and the treasures (mostly lumps of carved jade, which get a bit samey after a while too!).
The electronic guide (with GPS-ish map) was quite cool and useful, and, to be fair, the history as you looked at each of the Palaces of Somethingly Something was interesting (e.g. linking into Zheng He, the great ocean going admiral, the Boxer rebellion, etc.). Worth getting there as soon as it opens (8.30/9am) as, by the time I was bailing out just before lunch, it was heaving - even in the cold snowy conditions.
Personally, I found the Qianmen/Dazhalen shopping areas (restored, Disney-style, to resemble a fantasy verion of their 1920's heydey, complete with statues of merchants) south of Tian'anmen Square to be more interesting."
i went there during China National Holiday. there were millions of people. I would suggest that don't go there during their national holiday. i was packed up with humans. very packed up.
wow what an impressive place Spent a full day exploring the palace so much to see and take in. The only down side is the Chinese tourists from rural China who are on guided tours.They are very rude and have no manners at all.Just push and shove you out of the way.
It was way overcrowded on a weekday and it was hard to see much. It felt appropriate to stand back to let the Chinese tourists fight over glimpses of the main attractions as the struggle often turned feverish.
This place is a must see because of the rich Chinese history it represents. Knowing how long it has been around and viewing the architecture makes this place worth it. Wear your walking shoes.
"My advice is go in winter when it is less crowded. I was underwhelmed by the imperial palace, mainly as I couldn't see anything due to its popularity as a tourist destination. This was my second trip, my first was in winter and i remember being the only one in many areas. The palace is huge. My highlight was the calligraphy musuem, but on my second visit couldn't find it."
Way to crowded and too many little souvenir shops and such. Gives it a bit of a Disneyland feeling. And not in a good way.
"Hi Guys, had a great trip to Beijing and loved the forbidden city,temple of heaven and ofcourse the great wall!!
Like to give a few helpful tips on siteseeing spots! The best is to take a day tour as per your choice to avoid the Rip off prices done by taxi services(meter and private ones).
Taxi services not been efficient as anyone would like.
Infact i would recommned a travel agent ""Sunny"" she was excellent in her knowledge about the history and all kinds of information you would like, excellent in her english speaking,her contact details are ""Beijing Sunny Travel"" sunnyguide_2010@hotmail.com
I had an incident at the forbidden city been ripped off by the local 3 wheeler guys, and i had to fight it out to get even to them.
I would strongly recommend not to take private taxi and 3 wheeler guys, they really rip off!!
good luck!"
"It was mesmerizing. Each temple greater than the last. I walked from the front to the rear and caught a bus from the rear exist back around to the front. I really wasn't expecting such a large area. It would defiantly be more pleasant in warmer weather but then I understand it is much more crowded. I was glad to have a good coat, hat and gloves."
"Impressive the history and culture of the place as well as the beauty of it, so much to see, enjoy and to learn, fortunatly we had great tour guides (Violet and Lin) very knowledgeable, that gave us an excellent tour and history of the place. Thanks Violet & Lin, we love you"
"What an amazing place to visit. Make sure you enter at the very front, opposite Tiananmen Square. I bought a ticket at Donghuamen Gate and then pretty much had to make my way back through the rest of the external palace, to the main gate. But wow, what an impressive place to visit."
"One of the most historic sites in Beijing and a must see attraction during any trip. My tour was on the Saturday of the October holiday week, and there were huge crowds.

Visitors should be aware that many of the buildings are or can be closed to the public (at least they were during my visit; other reviewers do not seem to have had as significant a problem during visits at other times in the year). This was somewhat disappointing. The grounds are also huge, and include large areas of unattractive pavement between the buildings. But the buildings themselves are truly awe-inspiring, and for me, it was great just to be able to walk around a site with such a significant history. Perhaps the best equivalent I've experienced would be seeing the changing of the guard at Buckingham Palace years ago. Our own national parliament buildings here in Canada are somewhat new and modern in comparison.

There are a good number of museum shops and restaurants throughout, which are quite useful since you will want to take your time with your tour and have the occasional rest."
"The Forbidden City at Beijing was the best attraction for me overall in Beijing. Honestly speaking, at there what you get was only walk & look around the environment and take photos, nothing else you can do. But for those liked me, who like to listen the stories and know about the histories. It will be more than enough. Inside the forbidden city, everything was an antique including the wall bricks, trees, bricks on the road and etc.... There's really amazing."
The Imperial palace.. wonderful to visit with a guide.. Take pictures on top of the park opposite the Forbidden city's exit point.. Wonderful pictures of the whole Forbidden city and the far horizons..
I probably wasn't in the right frame of mind. It is awe inspiring and well worth the visit but at the start of December when it is -15 degrees not advised. Also get your elbows out- the tourists are pushy and not shy to get you out of the way if they want to have a look at what everyone else is looking at.
"It's better to climb Jing Shan(small man-made hill) behind the Forbidden City. You can see the whole building there. Inside is empty, should go to Taipei to admire the treasures."
"It's fantastic, I have been there 6 times during last 13 years from 1999 up to now. I like it so much because you can learn a lot of subjects from History"
"This is a most fascinating palace. Parts of it were repainted for the Beijing Olympics, I was told. But a sense of history permeates despite the new paint. The massive structures from the front gates to the palace walls and the surrounding moat talk of a time in history that was indulgent and opulent. I don't think anyone can stand in that courtyard and not be filled with awe."
"This place is beyond all expectations, whether b ased on size or scope. When we see scenes of the Forbidden Palace in movies, we see such a small part of the grounds. It is immense with many side buildings and rooms. Give yoourself at east two hours to stroll the grounds."
"went here in august, was extremely crowded. mostly local tour groups - it felt like subway rush hour at times getting through certain entrances and gates.

the site itself is amazing - be prepared for loads of walking. the free audio guide is a plus and is quite 'intelligent' too. defn go to the bookshops as they have some interesting stuff (not very expensive either).

after the first couple of open areas and buildings, to me, it was starting to become more of the same thing (perhaps because it was intended to be a simple structure). some of the buildings that housed items of interest were not lit, so was hard to see especially when you had a few rows of people ahead of you.

i wandered off the track, but didnt see any 'hidden' gems and finally gave up and left from the back entrance.

go for the experience for sure. early in the morning would be a good time or late in the afternoon before/after tour groups. definitely avoid weekends and holidays if you can."
"It is a very big site and a lot of it is quite similar, i know you shouldn't compare to other palaces around the world like Thailand, India ect but i felt it is quite ordinary and run down in comparison to other places we have visited. That is not to say that it should not be visited and if you have the audio tour it really gives you an insight to Chinese history which is great to understand. Some people will spend 4 hours here others maybe 1 hour - but which ever its worth a peek. The garden area was very interesting."
"It was way to cold to go in December esp if there are strong winds. All the chambers of the Emperors, empress etc are locked and closed up. You may only peep through the glass window for some chambers and others through a barricade. Interesting if only you have a tour guide to explain the historical aspect of the premise..."
"holiday, avoid the holiday. too many chinese students and teachers groups. you can't see more views except people 's head. best season to visit is Spring Late April and early May. Oct 1 -7 is national holiday too."
"The Forbidden City was an interesting walk, although I expected more (not sure what, just more). I think it would have been better if there had been more historical information (about the dynasties, the buildings, the history) in English/Chinese. It does not seem to be the Chinese way to embellish these sites, however - so best to read up before you go."
The size of the place. And to think that this was only for the emperor and his immediate personnel. Huge buildings and vast courtyards.
"Actually I couldn't see all, it was too big.
I went there around 14:30 but I saw half of palace, and it arleay around 5pm so I finished my tour.
for me, actually, the Palace is not that special because, we, Korea also have beautiful Palaces, and it is similer I think.
But for people from other culture, it would be fantastic!"
"When in Beijing, the forbidden city is a must do visit, read before, get there out of the chinese holidays to avoid the crowd and take your time (tours take you around 2-3 hours) to see the courtyard, museums, etc."
"Spectacular entrance, amazing inner courtyard, awesome construction, way too big. After the first rooms/structures were seen, it all becomes a repeat of the previous. The Chinese were/are masters of modular furnishings."
"Its a very beautiful place, with an incredible architecture.
You dont realize the magnitude of the palace until you are there.
It takes about 3 hours to visit all the known places at detail."
"The Forbidden City should be on your must see list in Beijing. Right behind. When you see the lion dog guard statues and the big picture of Chairman Mao you know you're at a central point. Right behind you across the street is the famous Tienanmen Square, which I recommend you visit as well. In fact if you are a serious photographer you may have to take your pictures of Forbidden City from Tianamen square as the guards otherwise the guards may question you and ask for your passport.

A tip for a great aerial of Forbidden city is to go up to Jingshan Park. It is a 15-20 hike up the mountain, but you will be rewarded with a view of all the buildings in Forbidden city as well as Beijing for money photo shots.

If you like my write-ups I encourage you to check out my Asia Travel Documentary film which covers Beijing, Shanghai, Hong Kong, Singapore, Guangzhou, Xian, and Taiwan. Google ChicVoyage in Asia to find it."
"After seeing ""The Last Emperor"" many years back, and many times since, I finally got a chance to explore the legendary Purple Forbidden City. Even on a winter weekday when the wind drops the chill factor to somewhere below Antarctica levels it's still crowded with Chinese tour groups, but it is still possible to leave them behind and find quiet corners. Especially in the easternmost Treasury section, as that costs an extra 10 yuan and is much less busy. The worst crowding is along the imperial axis, especially in front of the various thrones. There you will be fighting with Chinese tour groups for shots of the thrones in their gloom. The Imperial Garden is packed as well, and frankly has seen better centuries. I spent two days in the place, giving it a very thorough going over.
A few hints for visitors...
1. All the pavilions are clearly signposted with descriptions. There is also an audio guide you can rent which is apparently pretty good. So there is no need to bother with those people at the front gate who accost you for tours.
2. Don't neglect the side pavilions and other areas, which have exhibitions on various aspects of the Qing court (almost entirely Qing). They are largely ignored by the tour groups, and present a welcome warmth. The Treasury section to the east is also perhaps the most fascinating part of the City in terms of architecture and layout, and the garden is a lot nicer than the Imperial Garden.
3. There is a quick security check in the Meridian Gate entry passage, where your backpack will be x-rayed. But there are no restrictions on taking water at least in. I didn't try other beverages or food, but probably allowed.
4. Photography is allowed in all parts, but you cannot enter any of the original-state halls, so will have to jostle with the crowds to get the shot. The halls you can enter are the ones that are modified to become exhibition halls (usually with the original ceiling at least). These display jade, jewellery, and ceramics, but are rather dark inside--you'll need a fast lens. Wide-angle lenses are good too, but I personally found a lot of the more atmospheric shots were taken with a telephoto (at least 100-1500mm).
5. Toilets here are high quality for Beijing, officially rated Four Stars. There are also a lot of benches for when your feet get tired. And they will.
6. It shuts at 4:30 in winter, which is pretty early. Unless you start bang on opening time, you won't have a hope of seeing the entire thing in a single day.
7. Get great views over the roofs from the top of the North Gate: an exhibition of calligraphy and painting, signposted only in Chinese, is being held up there, but even if you aren't interested in the art, the views over the roofs are wonderful.
8. There is little or no shade, save on the north side of buildings.
9. After closing time you can't get back out from the Meridian Gate forecourt to the Gate of Heavenly Peace: you have to go out to the east and past the East Gate.
At any rate, the Forbidden City is simply not missable. It should be on everyone's list of places to visit at least once in their lifetime. It is awesome, in all senses of the word."
Nothing beats being able to feast your eyes on these magnificent bulldings and surroundings with so much history behind them. Take your time. Go early or you might run out of time like we did.
This is one of the top 3 must see places in Beijing. It's a huge facility that use to be the home of one man. Take an English speaking tour. There's some great shops where you can buy Chinese art cheap.
Our visit was with a good English speaking guide so we had a proper history lesson as well. A vast site & we believe we walked about 8 km or so. The Emperors knew how to separate themselves from the common herd! There are numerous walled compounds each with a building with a specific purpose. The opulence of the Palace is amazing. We were there on a cold Saturday so there were lots of people around but because of the size it was still not overly crowded. The Museum in the palace (at extra cost) is well worthwhile as there are stunning examples of Imperial jewellery. The exit involves going through the Emperor's bedroom full of purchasable antiques as well as a caligraphist again with purchasable works on demand. Pleasingly no pressure to buy.
"Since I'm a solo traveller without a tour package, I had the advantage? of being able to choose my Tour Guide when I arrived. After talking with several on the official and unofficial guides outside the entrance, I chose a young woman(official guide) who did a grat job.
The crowds were hung and the hear increased as the mornng wore on-- but whe did a great job of getting me into the areas of interest at my own pace, and explaining everything very well-- definitely worth the agreed price and tip."
"The Forbidden City, like all the sites in Beijing, is so interesting and definitely a must see. There is one impressive building after another and they are all interesting and beautiful. A must see."
"This is a great place for those who like to explore. I went with a tour group, so I had to stay close; otherwise, I'd have loved to spend several hours just wondering around on my own. We had a sunny day, and this ""city"" was a beauty to behold from any angle. One of my favorite stops on this 2-week trip. But, wear comfy shoes . . . ."
"Definitely worth a visit, so much history and culture to see and take in. It is however quite crowded and you can't get into most of the buildings. We did the audio GPS tour thing which was great, it moves on automatically as you move around. You can spend as long or short a time inside the Forbidden City as you want, and tailor your visit to the amount of time you have. We visited in winter which I think means it is less crowded and you don't wait as long for tickets. The guidebook I had suggests to do it backwards, ie enter from the north gate and walk down to the south as opposed to the other way that everyone seems to do, this may be a good idea in the summer if it is very crowded. Didn't come across much food and drink to purchase."
"Great time and well worth the visit. Be ready to ignore several attempts to show you the art gallery, a shortcut into the City, or a tour to the Great Wall-just keep walking. A meeting was being held in a very important buliding accross the street so several streets were blocked and many security checks-Westerns were allowed to past without much ado, but be ready for some unplanned detours and go with the flow."
"the restaurant serves ok coffee but the place is crowded and you can't get into most buildings, you can only peer through the windows."
"Title says it all. Touring it helps to understand Chinese history ""in situ"", but the uniform style can be described as one of harmony or monotony, depending on one's reaction to it."
The Forbidden City will transport you straight to the past. Chinese culture and history at its grandest splendour. Being within the city grounds will make you feel like you came straight out of a Chinese historical serial or movie. Profound and moving.
"Forbidden city has the most history and story from the 24 emperors of Ming and Qing dynasties until today. It is unlikely to discover all within a day or two and without knowing the histories of China. The Imperial Palace was formerly closed to the public but is now a vast museum and a major tourist attraction. You can find more than 900 buildings, gates and structures were built with arrangement along the north south central axis of old Beijing.It is advisable to take pictures as much as you can, this is the only way to bring back your memory while reviewing from the album. Interestingly, I took some pictures of the 308 giant vessels (mostly are bronze) and found two of the oldest with 520 years old make with iron near Taihedian from my album. So, if you are going to Forbidden City, pay attention to these two oldest iron vessels as not many people are aware from their outlook."
"I didn't expect the vast emptiness of the space. The gardens were nice, but it was hard to see inside any of the buildings and of course no one is allowed inside them. Very crowded!"
"My husband and I had only two days in Beijing before leaving on a cruise so we wanted to see as much of this fascinating city as we possibly could. We were staying at the Park Plaza which was less than a half hour walk to Tainanmen Square and The Forbidden City. As soon as we walked through the gates we were totally blown away with its sheer size and grandeur. Our intention was to take our time and wander through, but as soon as we saw just how vast this place was we opted to accept the offer of one of the many guides at the Palace to show us around. This added to our total enjoyment of our day as we were fortunate enough to get not only someone who was an absolute delight, but whose knowledge of the City brought this place to life for us. Our guide, Cindy, spoke excellent English and we negotiated a price with her right at the start. We learned so much of China's incredible history and culture in the few hours that we were there. We have kept in touch with Cindy via email since that day and she has agreed for me to put her contact details on this review...her phone number is 13693273147 and her email address is cindyluoyuan@gmail.com. But whether you opt for a guide or not, and even if you can only spare a couple of hours (a full day would be best) don't miss visiting The Forbidden City."
"It is a humongous place with lot of stairs and uneven ground as well. There are hundreds of rooms for the Emperor’s wives. For the amount of rooms we saw, it appeared that he had for himself all the beautiful young ladies that existed in China at that time. A really busy person. They have tried to keep everything in its original setting. Yes, it can be boring but it has a lot of history. It may be or is the world’s largest Palace. We were there in October but did not encounter any irregular behaviour for soliciting for rides or sightseeing, etc. Yes, you will be approached by a lot of vendors so if you are interested in buying something that you like then bargain hard. For us it was a pleasant visit. It has a number of washrooms. Take some bottled water as you will be walking a lot & wear comfortable shoes."
I cannot imagine how huge the palace until I set foot on it. We were told that there are several thousand of rooms in this gigantic palace! And it will take years to cover one room or chamber per day! Is a must-see in China!
Mindblowing. And the audio-guide - at 40 yuan - is really good too - it features an electronic map that guides you through the complex & the commentary is pretty good.
"When you arrive at the Forbidden City you'll be greeted with the majestic display of Chinese palaces before you. The different areas of the attractions features different sights.

What I particularly like was the middle area of the Forbidden City where you'll be standing at the top of a fleet of stairs leading to the other sections of the Forbidden City - from there, you'll be able to see how huge the area really is!

When in Beijing, you really have to visit the Forbidden City to witness the grandeur of ancient China!"
"Cannot visit China without spending a few hours at the Fobidden City. The greatness of the Chinese empire is evident through the Forbidden city! What a site! A must, must, must!"
"Great place to tour and really big. The audio tour was worth the money as it has a map with lights on it to tell you where you are in the city. This was really helpful since it's pretty easy to lose track of where you are, especially when walking around the six east or west palaces."
Appreciate the country for managing all the history across several centuries...one could just spend days to get the meet
"After walking in the Tiananmen square at the far end lies the forbidden city. Lovely place to visit. To see the architecture and sculptures. I read about this but it does help to have a knowledgeable guide.
Massive place that seem to keep going on and on."
"It was interesting but I got tired of it after a while. I'm not terribly fond of major tourist attractions and this one is no different. You're accosted by all kinds of scammers as soon as you get any where near the place - people aggressively pushing all kinds of things on you. I went there in the winter and it was still fairly crowded with people pushing and jostling to get close to the openings to view the thrones, etc. I finally veered off to the side to get away from the crowds. After awhile I felt like I was seeing one building after another that all looked the same. I purchased the audio tour rather than taking one of the tour guides up on their offerings. That was sufficient for my needs but it was supposed to stop/start based on GPS and where I was at. That didn't exactly work but overall it was good enough.

The imperial garden at the end was a pleasant surprise - unfortunately overrun by the rest of the tourists so I made a hasty exit. One I got out I was again accosted by all the annoying, aggressive peddlers. Fortunately I quickly caught a cab and got out of there. I can't imagine what it's like during the busy season.

Ladies - be aware that if you have a purse or any other kind of a bag it has to go through a security screening device and a mob of pushy people are crowded around the other end of it - you hope you can force your way in, in time to get your bag before someone else does."
"Walk through time in the vast area of temples and buildings that housed the ancient emperors of China, You need to use the audio sets to get a real taste, as the buildings do look similar. You can spend 2 1/2 hours there to get a real flavor for the ancient city."
A phenomenal place to visit and try to get your head around the fact that the Emporers killed any man who tried to enter and ruin their place in the world...To know that this place existed so many years ago and has been kept intact is incredible.
"Loads to see here, but give yourself plenty of time to look at all the areas to the side. You'll feel like you just want to walk down the middle with the pavilions, but there's plenty to see besides that.

Be wary of touts for nearby attractions, such as Tiananmen, who'll tell you it's closed for tourists today, or too expensive etc."
"you only miss there the martial art players jumping from one roof to another
other than that: exactly like it seems in documentaries"
"I dream for years about the forbidden city, but when I got there it was a big disappointment , too much empty places, repeat building could not access to the inside, too many tourist.
I rented a electronic guide, that told me history too fast or too slow half the time, I could not remember half of the story."
"As one walks through this giant facility, its history is not portrayed in a meaningful way as the artifacts that occupied it are mostly absent from the visitors' experience. Nevertheless, it is a ""must do"" when in Beijing and is part of the nearby Tiananmen Square experience. If you haven't seen the movie ""The Last Emporer"", you might wish to do so before you go so that you can visualize the history of the palace."
"Where to begin - the area is huge and it is impossible to visit every pavilion - unfortunately some of the displays are now closed off due to graffiti which is disappointing - the history, the workmanship and the beauty of the city is incredible - it would be easy to spend a whole day there and still not see everything."
"The palace is huge and very well kept, get your audio guide and plan at least half a day to do this attraction. And please, BEWARE of the people offering you tours, bike rides, etc. outside the Forbidden City - or any other tourist attraction. Trust me on this one. There are a LOT of people that in cahoots to get your money."
"I went there for a whole day planning to see more of it. Turning away from the main tourists path from south to north, I've discovered that:

a)Treasure and some other museums on the north-east side (15% of territory) were available only at additional payment.
b) buildings south of east & west gates were some military and staff blocks with either locked gates or ""Authorized personel only"" warning signs. (15% jf territory each)
c) Tower with dragons on north-west had no access with walls and locks around it.(10% of territory)
d) some yards inside the central part were closed on locks without any explanations. Through keyholes I could see either parked 3-wheeled bicycles, either soldiers & workers digging something into the ground.

After 15 pm they've started step-by-step closing yards and gates so at 16pm all gates on sides of the main walk were closed with locks hanging on them.
At 16.20 they've started to push all visitors to nearby gates and on 16.30 totally closed the entire palace."
"I have seen the movie The Last Emeror, so it was a must for me to go and see the place for real. It was a fantastic morning, to walk through the gates and explore the place. They maintain it very good, so it was worth the visit."
"Lots to see...really too much to cram into a morning, but still definitely worth a visit. Decent crowds, even for a cool Nov morning."
"If one is visiting Beijing then the Forbidden City is amust to visit.
The entrance from Tiannemen Square with the famous image of Chairman Mao above is impressive. A tour is weel worth joining as you will given lots of extra info. Also when leaving pay the extra and take the steps on to the famous balcony overlooking Tiannemen. You can just imagine the famous leaders watching the large processions beneath"
"If you are all the way over there, you must see the Forbidden City. Give yourself a whole day, It is huge, There are many pagodas, courtyards, statues, gardens and passageways to see. Yes, it is over a thousand years old and shows its age. But, it is history. You need to see it in that context. Anywhere you go in China, you need to bring bottled water and be aware of the poor toilet facilities. That's just the way it is. If that bothers you, stay in Des Moines. Otherwise, enjoy centuries of history not available in the U.S. Make sure you have a knowledgeable guide to explain everything you see."
"I had very limited time but took the Lonely Planet Guide advice and rented a GPS headset, which gave commentary depending on your location. Great value.
Be prepared for crowds."
"Huge city of pagoda's,courtyards and passages and concrete slabs. Rather disappointing unkept historical buildings of beijing.
Hundreds of people visit this city and unfortunately not many places to sit and rest, poor hygienic toilet facilities and not enough for so many people. Take water with you and comfortable shoes and an umbrella to protect from the sun or rain.
The outside of the Forbidden city looks more spectacular than the inside., but, nevertheless, an experience off my bucket of things to do before I die."
The Forbidden City is easy to access and really has to be seen. I did not realise how vast the grounds would be and one could easily spend a lot of time here. Make sure you grab some water and maybe even a snack on your way in.
"So much history here and halfway through we looked at each other and wanted to run and rent the last emperor. You have to invasion a lot as many of the treasures are no longer there, but the base, the structure is. It is somewhat difficult to get around without a wheelchair for an elderly person, but your hotel or tour guide can arrange a chair and pusher for you and so worth it."
"Went here as a couple..

Location 5/5
Centre of Beijing. Taxis can’t actually park near the place, dropped off in a side-road.

Atmosphere 4/5
Outstanding feel. Some security checks on the way in (although we visited during the governmental handover). A bit annoyed by the number of gift shops inside the city but I suppose a necessity in the current age.

Value 5/5
80 RMB for both of us, a bargain.

Overall 5/5
Unmissable: one for the bucket list."
It is so big and so well preserved that i recommend you take your time go without a guide as they will rush you though take your time and enjoy all it has to offer i think you can get self guided hearing tours so much history its well worth the visit
"In the Forbidden City, it is easy to get lost in a maze of courtyards, halls and passageways.
One of the many thrones room throughout the Forbidden City"
"This structure has been around since the Ming dynasty and have seen the fall of both Ming & Qing dynasties. Standing more than 600 years now, it has underwent numerous repairs and reconstruction but still the Chinese has done great splendid effort in preserving this piece of important history. One must visit Forbidden City when in Beijing. Will definitely in awe in the structure and it's like travelling in a time machine, back to the past. RIch historical culture. A must visit."
"The architecture is beautiful and well maintained. If you are staying in Beijing for one day, you should visit here."
The whole palace is of awesome architecture and amazing buildings but if you have been to china or asien countries often you could be kind of templed out. so i was...this is why i decided to take a personal guide to get some information about the background. was the best idea i had this day :-) with the guide the whole building is even more impressing. e.g. build in only 14 years. was kind of jealous about the 3000 concubines the guy had.
"Impressive buildings (the woodwork!), impressive design (the dragons on the wall, the designs in the rock slabs), impressive atmosphere (what must it be like to have lived here)...."
The history and scenery in the gardens and around the forbidden city must be seen to be appreciated. The sheer scale of it all is magnificent too!
"Schedule your trip to the forbidden city carefully. The 18th Plenary Session of Congress was in town when we went. We had to walk nearly 1.5 miles to get to the one security checkpoint to get into the Tienanmen Square area, from which you enter the forbidden city. We stood in three security lines, each of roughly equal to an airport security screening. Wanded in one line; patted down to include one's privates in another; and frisked in still a third. An hour later, we were finally able to go buy the tickets.

The forbidden city is vast. It's full scope is only visible from the steps of the third temple overlooking the great internal square. There, you can see the rooftops of all the servants quarters that worked in the emperor's employ. The city contains what appears to be more than 100 different structures. It is a city. Many sections were closed during our stay, which was the low season. The areas that were open were very crowded, and made it difficult to take good pictures, but there are nice picture books for sale should one's happy snaps not turn out. Still, even walking around the outside of these structures and looking at the painting and architecture is both stunning and worth doing. .

China is working on careful restoration and one will notice varying levels of decay among the structures. On some the roofs are in tact, with bright paint and in good repair (appear new). In others, plant life is growing from the roof, suggesting serious damage will result in only a year or two. To their credit, the Chinese government had several teams working on restoration projects while we where there.

Some rooms are still set out as the emperor left them, while others have been converted to museum galleries. There is a lot to see. I recommend that you allow at least 4 hours for a full visit -- maybe even longer if you are of the type who wants to see and study everything.

The city is an UNESCO World Heritage Site, for good reason. It captures a lost age in China, and as it is currently set up and is being maintained, it captures it well."
Not worth the RMB 60 entrance fee.l read up the history on the net but took some lovely colourful photos
. The place is huge with many similar looking buildings And gardens. Your visit will be more meaningful if you understand the history behind the palace buildings.
"I visited the Forbidden City several times and I would recommend visiting it on a sunny Winter day when the crowds are bearable and you can even find some total privacy in your exploration of this huge museum. Always keep in mind to turn around again and again, you will see so much beauty, hidden in your back!"
"What can one say about the Forbidden City which hasn't been said before, and with much better words. Just go there and absorb it."
"Visiting this place will give you the history of China. If you're not going there with a tour guide, be sure to get an audio guide so you'll know the history of each building there. It can be quite tiring going around. There are lots of visitors everyday, most especially the weekends and holidays."
"The best way there is by subway, with two stations on each side. Truly impressive structures, nice restuarant before third gate."
The sheer scale is breathtaking. So is the lack of creature comforts for those who lived there. Beautiful but as you go through each gate towards the centre it seems to repaeat itself
"Each person will have his on opinion, but for our small group with translator and guide, we found the Forbidden City to be like a Disney rebuild, only the exteriors are visited, along with a million other visitors on the same day. The history is extremely interesting, but the few rooms which you could view furnished through dirty glass windows were poorly lighted and had not been cleaned, labeled or dusted in many many years. Our supposedly private tour guide was boring and Disneyesque in speaking to our group of well travelled and studied individuals. Work needs to be done to preserve and cherish this incredible site!"
"Not what we expected, couldn't really view any historical artefacts, crowds of people. Where we exited it was not clear where we might get a taxi and in fact it was very difficult to get back to the hotel, a number of taxis simply refused to take us."
"Granduer! Can you imagine they lived this way!!!! Be patient and take time to see this place.

Another bucket list item.

Dont miss this visit.

Just a request to the authorities... pls provide more rest rooms and well maintined ones. The place is massive and its not that easy to reach back to the hotel."
"I could live here. There is so much to see and explore. You need more than a day here. It is not so much the beauty of the palaces and smaller buildings, it is the minutia of this hisotical setting that demonds so much time. I took over 500 photographs knowing that this was a once in a lifetime trip. Everyone takes picture after picture of the buildings, but it is the statuary ouside and within the buildings that is so fantastic. Walk around the buildings, check out the roofs, the wooden moldings, the doors, the walls and especially the corners of each building. The possibilities are endless. Bring all your memories of this historic site and share them with all your friends."
"I thought this was an overglorified palace. Boy was I wrong! It truly is a city within Beijing. Beautiful gardens, palaces and history all over the place. Definitely worth an afternoon!"
You can't say you've been to Beijing unless you visit this truely amazing place. To do justice to it however takes time. So make sure you dedicate enough time to make it a worthwhile experience.
"I travel for the most part to marvel at the magnificence of things. This is one of those moments!
Cannot be missed.
It's architecture and history and culture on such a grand scale."
"This place was much bigger than I expected. Heard from tour guide that this is the place where people usually get lost. It is not only big, but every pavilion and scenery looks similar. You can also see some hundred years old trees.

Somehow the place seems to close early, around evening time, so do plan your itinerary well."
Very crowded the day we went - mostly locals. Scale of this is way bigger than you think. Signage and descriptions could be a lot better - looks like a work in progress. Dont miss this.
"it is a very nice place to go, but very crowded. i recommend beihai park as it offers a great view. if you go to the forbidden city, ask for those acoustic guides (40RMB or so). otherwise you just walk through it..."
"very big and very grand. Just one of those places you have to visit. Careful, do NOT accept rides from guys with pedal cars. it's a scam!"
"The Forbidden City is the astonishing and beautiful shell of a once amazing empire. It is a view from the outside as you see the buildings only from the vast courtyards and cannot enter. Were this magnificent site to be once again furnished as it was this would be an even more amazing site.
Even if you do not use your imagination to see into the past this is truly an magnificent place now.
Although sadly hollow it is a must see and an amazing place."
"There is one one forbidden city - (not really actually there is more) - certainly a place of its own.
Not quite as forbidden as the name might indicate expect huge crowds of (mainly Chinese) tourists but its easy to avoid them if you stay away from the center of the palace.

Easy to imagine due to the sheer size that this was once the Center of one of the biggest empires earth has seen. Must have been a very intimidating sight for any foreign dignitary walking through two huge richly decorated gates, just to find yourself on a gigantic square.
However the real fascination lies in the detail and the symbolism of each and every building, gate and walkway.

Take some time to explore the sides and the park in the end of the complex."
"Fabulous place, difficult to describe, we'll worth a visit. The whole area is just full of colour and history"
"It was a massive place that required a whole day if you were to cover the place thoroughly. As we were on a conducted tour, we spent about 2 hrs with the guide giving a historical background of the Palace."
"This was an enormous Palace. We had a guide book to explain what each of the buildings was for, but they all seemed to meld into having the same purpose (rule over the peasants). The draw is really the massive scale on which this Palace was built. There was a large crowd when we were there on a Wednesday morning. This is easy enough to do with your own self-guided tour - a hired guide is not necessary."
Just an incredible opportunity to see such a wonderful historical site. I cant even describe the feeling of walking through such history. A must See!
Without doubt Forbidden city is atonishing... however it is so sad that you can not see more buildings inside the city.
"Get lost in the forbidden city, and its countless alleys, courtyards, buildings and gardens for a wonderful experience of this cultural icon..."
"I would say this is one of the top 3 must visit in Beijing. I went there twice, first time entered the Back Entrance and walk till the Front Entrance. The 2nd visit I entered from the Front Entrance. The view and feel is just different as you can see the LINK if you enter from the Front Entrance.

If you really like to appreciate the history and full journey, then the whole journey would take around 2-3 hours, or even more. Suggest to enter via the main entrance (facing Tiananmen Square), go through East Wing, walk till the end, then go back to the main entrance using West Wing route. Most of the tourist just visit either one wing only because they will enter from the Main entrance and go out using the back entrance.

For those who just want to 'BE THERE' only, then just simply pick East route or West route also can. Must enter from the Main Entrance, don't enter from the back entrance."
"What amazing place. And our guide Miss Sunny was so informative without being boring. Kids learnt so much and talk about everything they saw and heard. Definitely recommend going, but make sure you go to the toilet before heading out otherwise you may be in for a true local experience"
"More impressive that what I saw in documentary films. We only manage to see a small part of it during our 2 hrs there. With a good guide, one can understand a lot about chinese history just from this place. As impressive as Windsor Castle."
"let's not kid ourselves, if you are in Beijing and you've never been to the Forbidden City, you just have to go. Especially considering that you need to see Tiananmen Square anyway, and the Forbidden City is across the street.

That being said, it's going to take two or three hours to walk through from beginning to end if you actually try to see anything. You need comfortable walking shoes and to be dressed warmly if it's the cold season. There are bathrooms inside but they are few and far between and they aren't luxurious. There's not a lot to eat or drink inside.

So bring your camera and maybe a backpack of supplies and enjoy, because it is quite amazing."
"The Forbidden City cannot be missed, however another reviewer is spot on in advising to 'manage your expectations'.

When you first enter the city, the scale of the courtyard is unimaginable. The Imperial Canal that surrounds the city and snakes through this courtyard was man made so that the emperors could be transported by boat from the Yangtze River, which is hundreds of kilometres away. Just like the city and the Great Wall, a mind boggling feat involving tens of thousands of workers and complex logistics.

You then proceed through a succession of courtyards and buildings that feel similar to the last, the redeeming feature being the magnificence of the architecture. After half an hour of walking through courtyards and buildings, it begins to feel like a bad dream looping. The frustration of trying to catch a glimpse inside buildings (having to tussel through crowds) compounds this anxiety, however if you read this and other reviews beforehand, forewarned is forearmed and there is no doubt that with some planning, this can be an unforgettable experience.

The gardens at the other end were a wonderful surprise after the above, however by the time we got here it was nearing the end of the day (5ish) and the staff began crowd control measures at the exit of the gardens, at which point I was very nearly separated from my tour group as they tried to shut the gates - an alarming experience.

My advice: take some time to marvel at the courtyard just inside the entrance, proceed fairly quickly til you get to the gardens and don't go towards the end of the day when a daily Hillsborough disaster will take place at the exit gate."
"It was crowded, it had a theme park ambience but we spent 6 hours there and still couldnt see it all ....Breathtaking in some parts but intimate in others it was worth every jostle and make sure you get the audio guide"
"interesting at least in part because Chinese visitors also absorbed by the place
the audio guide was useful
the tour does not take as long as they say
beware being diverted to the art shop if you do not want to spend time on a sales experience"
"We were fortunate enough to visit on a day that was not gloriously busy so had plenty of time to explore the Palace in relative peace. A truly monolithic and regal structure, its reputation precedes it and no visit to Beijing is complete without seeing the Forbidden City."
"Quite crowded, but worth the walk around. So much to look and see how they lived back then.
We went one Moon-cake Festive, and that's not a good move as the crowds merged all over the place. Just took me back to image Marco Polo was there."
"World Heritage Site and one can see why. Of course there are lots of other visitors - who gets a private viewing...But after the first few buildings and thrones... It kind of gets 'samey'. We walked out the far gate and up the hill to the temple which overlooks the roofs of the Forbidden city and then into baiha (Check spelling) park...From from front gate to exiting the park 4 hours walking steadily... confused by others comments about food inside... Its a world heritage site not sure what kind of cafe or restaurant would or should be allowed. It is a must see...but perhaps because it is 'flat' lacks the drama of an Empire State, Eiffel Tower, Sydney harbor bridge experience...."
"It the sight everyone comes to see and of course you have to when you're in Beijing. But be prepared to be in the throng of hoards of tourists, who are mostly Chinese.

It was a really hot day when we were there and a Saturday so lots more tourists than during the week perhaps. We were often as interesting to the Chinese as the sights being foreigners and were asked to pose in numerous photos!!!

It really does take a long time to see it all so have good walking shoes as the distances, like everywhere in Beijing, are quite deceiving. Food at restaurant inside not so great so maybe take a packed lunch if you can.

The audio guide is OK but I think a private English speaking guide would be better so you can ask questions. There seem up be a lot of students at the gates offering services.

It is an amazing insight to Chinese culture and how Royal life was once lived. A lot more fortified than European cities that's for sure."
"truly unbelievable...lots of walking, great photo opportunities here. If you love history...this is it."
Go only if you can walk the palace is nothing but high walls....there are 999 rooms great architecture....what a technology.....see the throne and old garden etc. good for a visit....but i heard it is worth seeing the summer palace which i missed due to this anyway for first time this is good
"The history and architecture were very interesting. However, the massive flow of tourists that could be pushing and noisy and the long queue of everything didn't make the visit worth it for me. And I did get there quite early having read the other recommendations here. There was no decent food sold inside either and it's a large place which even if a swift pace that I took (because of the number of tourists) still took 3 hours to cover just some main parts of the palace. So if you go, do prepare some snacks with you. But it was just a so-so experience for me to say the most. I wouldnt go back. If some people want to visit, they may have to prepare a different strategy!"
"The place are so fantastic for us, the historical of the buidding are really amazing, we love this place very much."
"I was very fortunate to see Turandot performed in teh Forbidden city in Sept 1998.

A spectacular place and on such a vast scale. Yes there will be crowds but lets be realistic it is China after all. Don't missit when your in Bejing"
It looked alright but you had to pay to see anything at all. I wish I had more time to look around. However I did take one of my favourite photos getting into the Forbidden city of a soldier.
"Very crowded but worth it, especially the peaceful garden on the north side. A must see for anyone visiting Beijing."
"We were here with a tour and we had 2 hours to rush through the square and the City. We ran up the west side of the City and missed most of the centre and east side displays. Really this site deserves a full day and a few hours isn't enough.

It is an interesting look at history and the fiberglass pillars show that a lot of it has been rebuilt recently. Yet the guides won't admit that, I guess it would detract from the historical nature.

I love love to see more of this, but even a quick view was stunning. Just watch the cabs at the North gate, most of them are Gyspy cabs, so you have to go a ways to find one that won't cheat you."
"The security that was incorporated into the city was not surpassed by any other culture. A moat, wall and 15 layers of bricks to eliminating tunneling kept the Emperor and his Royal guards safe.
Money was no question and the artisans that worked in the city were the best in class."
"This is one of the highlights of all my visits to China. so much of old china has gone that seeing what it must have been like is great. Went on a wet cold wintrrs day and got there at opening at 8:30am. Even then there were tour groups starting but not many. Grab a audio guide or better still a guide that speaks your language. I got the audio guide which was informative but full of gaps.
The straight through route south to north takes about 1hr no stops but I spent 3 hours exploring west and east palaces. East palace costs another RMB10 but worth it for no crowds and some beautiful courtyards.
Take warm clothes if its winter."
"The Forbidden City is an impressively large and extremely busy place with hoards of tourists all clamouring to see the sights. To see inside the buildings, it is necessary to fight off the Chinese tourists whose sense of order and decorum is non-existent.
Nonetheless, a superb place to spend an afternoon."
"If you're in Beijing, you're almost certainly going to see this anyhow, but do make sure that you don't miss it. It's incredibly huge and hugely incredible. If possible, try to go on a sunny day, but not too sunny or the crowds will be even thicker, and there aren't a lot of places to hang out and rest that are out of the sun."
"Well it's Beijing so obviously it is going to be very busy. My advice is try to get a tour with your hotel that covers a few of the must see locations - it will avoid the queues that we saw. Thankfully we had arranged to join a tour so we got to bypass all of that. The structure itself is amazing but lacking on the finishing touches. Some of the little huts have been done very nice and some...have not. Anywhere there is water....there is dirt. They seem to treat them like a rubbish bin which is very unfortunate. A more structured viewing system would be a bit better as you would be able to view inside the various little buildings without being pushed along by the local tourists.

We did this as part of a tour so i can't say for sure what the value for money is for each individual tourist spot. The tours are by far the way to go, though do expect to see a lot of Jade and Silk Factories! :)"
"Be prepared for the crowds and some pushing and shoving. It can't be avoided. Astonishing to think that just a handful of people lived in this small city. If you don't have a guide, purchase the audio tour. Hike to Jingshan Park afterwards for the amazing views back at the Forbidden City."
This was a great tour although very long. We were dropped off at one end and walked through to the other. Really fascinating the immense size of it all but there are no artifacts except for a few rooms so you really just walk from one end to the other. Our guide was great filling in the interesting stories and although we really enjoyed it it did become a bit same same.
"Historically, an important place to visit but be prepared for tons of people. We were with a guide which was very informative. I would have liked to have time away from the guide to wander off into the hidden corners of the Forbidden Palace instead of staying with the crowds."
"We went to the Forbidden City on our own without a guide. This meant we could discover the place for ourselves. We had already been to the Summer Palace with Sherry, an excellent guide, so we had some understanding of the history. Each palace was more magnificent than the last. The area is huge and at each point there are excellent information boards provided by American Express. We went on the opening day of the Chinese Communist Party congress, the most important one for ten years where new leaders are appointed. This meant that the touring parties which normally visit Tiananmen Square and then coming through to the Forbidden City were not there and the place was quiet. We also went early so that we avoided the queues."
"Amazing place! A huge museum, so different from any other I've been in the world! Worth to just walk around. Not to be missed by anyone who've been at Beijing!"
"for this your best start early around 9am. it closes at 4pm so make sure you start early. its a historic site, so read about it before you visit. its alot off walking, wear comfortable shoes. alot of tourists as well. all in all a very nice experience. we had lunch at the main restaurant - excellent food and beer!"
"I spent a very relaxing and absorbing day at the Imperial City. Managed to extract myself from the persistent private ""Tour Guide"" who wanted to escort me around (for a cost) and headed for the audio-tour booth just outside the entrance. Well worth the 60RMB to hire for the day. (Cleverly uses sat-nav technology to keep track of where you are located and provides relevant info on what you're looking at). Not too crowded on the Saturday I visited and enjoyed a very unhurried and educational wander through China's imperial history. Beware artists in the ""library"" who put on a VERY hard sell to get you to buy their work. Whilst I'm normally not a fan of tourist gift shops, the Imperial Palace gift shop (towards the end of the tour) is worth a visit. Not too expensive and some good things rather than the normal tacky plastic ashtrays etc. Don't forget to hand back your audio guide or alarms go off! (No, I didn't). Also, once you've left the Palace at the back gate, its worth crossing the road to Jingshan Park and walking up the hill for a magnificent view of the whole palace. (Don't accept offers of a ride to the top, it's not necessary unless you have major difficulties walking)."
"Really impressive complex with many large courtyards along the way. If you love the movie 'The last emperor' you must see this place. You cannot walk intot the many pavillions where the emperors sat and lived as they are blocked off but you can view inside through doorways.

Signage is poor so do some research before. You can do a walk through in about an hour.

The only negative was the hoards of unruly large tour groups with bellowing tour leaders. But you just have to put up with that sometimes."
It's definitely a must see. There are a lot of people and it's a one way system - make sure to enter through the South Side. Visit the park above for an excellent view.
Beautiful buildings and so much history! Truly amazing! A must when you visit Beijing. Fascinating history and it all comes to life wandering around these huge grounds. Loved it!
"This place has such a rich history and an intense atmosphere. It's one of the most visited tourist attractions in the whole world, and for good reason. You could spend hours at this place exploring the different rooms, admiring the architecture or simply taking in China's long, turbulent and heroic history. There is a small entrance fee and it gets extremely packed. It's almost impossible to get a photo without anyone else in the background. The most popular thing here would the Emperor's chair. You can literally get lost in this place because it's so big, best to get a map at the entrance. I would definitely recommend this place to everyone visiting Beijing. It's a must see."
"If in Beijing, you must visit the Forbidden City. Visiting this site is one of the points of coming to Beijing. This is the site that was used in the movie the Last Emperor, and it is the real deal. The history is evident, and it is a rich experience that must not be missed."
This included a lot of walking and I think we only saw about 20 percent of the Forbidden City. Good thing we knew to wear good walking shoes
"One cannot travel to Beijing without visiting its most famous landmark, the Forbidden Palace. Today it is more of a museum with thousands of other tourists visiting it daily to see the magnificent structures and the ancient grandeur of this imperial compound which was the capital of Chinese politics and royalty for over 500 years. We went with our private guide who explained the history and architecture of the structure as she walked us from one end of the palace to the other. The first thing that struck me was the size of the buildings and the vast space that the palace occupies. No matter how many photographs you have seen of the building, in reality it is much more larger. With large open spaces of land between each building and the next. It is too sad that we could only enjoy the buildings from the outside, since tourists were not allowed to enter the palace. After 3 hours our kids got tired and we were ready to leave."
get yourself a audio guide is better than the book you buy.never take taxi when you exit from the back gate of the palace. you can walk from the left and there a park call tzu shan park. is nice and exit tiananmen.
If you are visiting beijing this is a total must. It's like stepping back in time to a totally dfferent world. There are so many different sections to the city that you will need a full day to complete it. Even the paving stones are carved. The colours are vibrant and its unusual to note that the buildings are mostly made of wood - the Temple of Heavens' pillars are huge trees that have been shaped and painted. The buildings are impressive with the roofs carved with dragons etc but do tend ro run together the further you get into the city. At the very back is a wonderful little garden that was apparently only for the Emperors use. A totally wonderful day!
We did not use a guide but used the electronic guides that you can purchase and these were perfect as you could go around at your own pace. Make sure you take water and snacks in with you as there isn't any facilities and you can be in there for hours.
It is a must visit if you are visiting Beijing. There are many courtyards through which you have to walk and on the sides of which you have the special attractions. The architecture of the city is worth an applaud. A guided tour would be a better choice or atleast a book they sell with details of the attractions inside and a map.
Forbidden city along with Tiananmen square are obvious must-see attractions in Beijing. It was very busy in the Forbidden city and extremely chaotic in the area to tour the gate house - for travellers who only speak English we found it hard to understand where to go for tickets and the procedure for checking in bags. Wish we had taken a guided tour of this area.
"Another example of the history of china, so much more than what we are taught in our school years, another place you must visit if you are interested in the history side of things."
"With the Forbidden City, it is just one of the things you have to see when you visit Beijing. The buildings themselves are impressive at first glance, though they start to run together after the first four or five. But take the time to notice the great paint work on the rafters and the stone carving, and you will continue to be amazed. My favorite part was the stone carvings on the ramps up to the buildings.

I got the audio tour in English, which really helps as there are little to no signs. However, since it is triggered off your location, make sure to stay by the building until the narration is complete or you will miss the stories just as they are getting good.

One thing to note - it is crowded with many tourists, so be prepared for crowds and willing to wander the side paths to avoid the huge jams at the doors."
"We were astonished at the expanse and the number of courtyards. It seemed to go on and on forever. We were glad we had bought candied fruit on skewers at the entrance courtyard as that kept us going. It was hard to find drinks inside, though there were a couple of places. And the hawkers in the courtyard were good natured and cheerful. Would suggest that people gave themselves about three hours or maybe two and visited two or three courtyards and then walked the others briskly. One could picture the Last Emperor, Puyi, riding his tricycle on the cobble stones. The water pots were big enough to hid a person in and we watched one curious tourist clamber out of one. Take good walking shoes to survive this one, and extra water."
"You cannot visit Beijing without seeing the Forbidden City but once in it you will be struck by the very poor effort that has been made to display the interiors of the buildings, including the imperial quarters. No one may enter any of the buildings so that their interiors are viewed from narrow and crowded portals. None of the interiors is lit so that they are seen an dingy and dusty caverns. The living quarters of the last Emperor and Dowager Empress can only be seen through dark and dirty windows and, again, are not lit to show them off. It is almost as though the present Emperors of China cannot bear the thought of really displaying to advantage the luxury of the imperial past.

For sheer scale and design the Forbidden City is magnificent and a ""must see"", and that scale simply does not dawn on you until you are drawn inside the complex. But we left it with a tinge of disappointment that so much more might have been made of this symbol of China's past."
"Didn't feel the need for a guide. Takes a couple of hours of walking. A kilometer from beginning to end. Built by a million people back in the 1400s. Very impressive and spacious. Serious amounts of tourists go thru every hour, but it is so spacious it doesn't seem crowded. Visit Tinanmen Square first."
What a beautiful place. A must if you visit Beijing. Colors and sights beyond your imagination. Make sure your camera has a large card...the Kodak moments are all around you.
We visited on a weekend yet there were people everywhere. The architecture and the interiors of the imperial palaces were unique and simply breath taking.
Amazing to see the amount of space that the emperors had and to see the wealth they had. Be prepared for a lot of walking. if you are interested in history then a private guide might be the answer.
"One cannot imagine the scale of this place until you are physically there. I know that this place is big, but this is much much bigger than what i imagine. the electronic guide is a must, this is gps tracked and can identify the location you are in and provide the relevant information. be prepared to spend at least 4 to 5 hours and this only allows you to touch the surface without any depth."
"The place is huge! Amazing by its size. Even if one courtyard open on another and that it is quite the same all the time (you have 5-6 yards). It is still a MUST-see!
The temple that is on a hill at one end of Forbidden City is also a Must-see!"
A true WOW experience. Well worth spending the time looking at the incredible work that went into the building of this palace. I cannot describe the beauty - just a continuous WOW experience as you turn around each corner or enter a new courtyard.
It is worth walking through where you can. Too much security for me so I just walked along the edges of this great site.
"One of the many 'not to be missed' sights in Beijing.
Worthy of a several hour tour, but be prepared for the hoards of tourists (mostly Chinese!)."
people watching in the square was incredible. A lot of Chinese tourists from other parts of China were there. You could tell by their dress and their looks.
"Forbidden City - you need atleast a full day to see it! tours do not allow that. It is stunning. The history unbelievable. When we came home we bought the movie ""the last emperor"" which are guide told us was actually filmed in the forbidden city. He was right, it brought us right back into the city and saw things we didn't see while we were there. A must see while in Beijing."
"The Forbidden City is a treasure for the World. I visit every time i go to Beijing. I just wish the Chinese Government would restrore it to its former beauty. Maybe even have peoplel dressed as Qing Dynasty guards to help people understand the context of its size and capacity. Although I find it depressing to see the wood work deteriorating and the treasures of the Empress Dowager's area moldy and rotting. It's still a magnificent sight to see.

come on China! Fix it up!"
"Ever since ""The Last Emperor"" and my grandparents visit to China after they opened the doors to Westerners, I have wanted to visit the Forbidden City. It is smaller than I expected, but still is very large. I spent about 2 hours walking around the campus. I purchased the self-guiding tour headset and it was well worth it. On a recommendation from a friend, I visited first thing in the morning to beat the crowds. That is the thing to do. There was not too many, by China standards, at the site this early and as I was leaving there was a very, very long line to enter. Next time I would like to spend more time exploring around outside of the Forbidden City."
We didn't even stop or turn left or right into the side chambers. We walked right straight through the palace and it already took us hours. Need good shoes. Need good camera. Need to prep yourself to see hordes of people.
"Put on comfortable shoes, there is a lot of walking involved to see it all..... Best to go early - finish by walking up the hill behind....and get a full view of Beijing and see the size of the F C site."
"I do recommend you go with a guide, who will tell you interesting things about this wonderful palace complex, inhabited by the Emperors of China for a scarcely-believable half a millennium. Pay for the best English speaking guide you can find. Beautiful buildings hide a multitude of fascinating facts. Enjoy."
"Many temples and a lot of walking through this city, huge area. A lot has been repainted (for the Olympic Games) so looks very clean, although you still see some building which have not had the facelift, and you then realise the age.All beautiful colours."
"The vast Forbidden City area is so immensely overcrowded that you hardly can look at the places of interest, especially inside the buildings and where you can't enter, from the outside. We were also wondering whether all is really old. Some of the palaces and buildings are so over-renovated that they don't really look genuine, respectively resemble all the fake doors etc. in the shopping malls and hotels. But the exhibitions inside the houses and palaces are displayed in an extremely old-fashioned style. We had a bit an ambivalent impression. If you go there in the late afternoon it's less crowded and has a great light, but since its so vast you might get problems to see and explore the whole area."
"The atmosphere commences from the moment you view the Forbidden City from Tianamen Square. The surviellance is noticeable and the military presence powerful. The journey along the north / south line is through a series of gates, each with its own history. Like the square the amount of space devoted to courtyards is overwhelming given the dimension of the population on the other sides of the walls. You are somewhat isolated from the world and become aware of a world within everyday behaviour. The location is essentially an imperial palace with many ceremonial halls and every turn has its own importance and mystique. The interesting gardens at the northern end where a welcome relief after acres of masonary structures. No visit to Beijing is complete without a tour of this piece of Chinese history."
"The history astounding, a long walk but worth it though not made to feel welcome as a British tourist not somewhere I would rush back to"
"The various structures that comprise the Forbidden City were not startling but history is fascinating - especially you had seen The Last Emperor. My husband and I had a guide throughout our stay in Beijing and his assistance with understanding the history China, Beijing was priceless. You must see the Forbidden City to get an understanding how China came to where it is now."
"Fabulous historical sight that provides an understanding of the status of the Emperor and his wives. Stunningly restored and huge the site will wear out children (too far to walk) and if you visit in Winter as we did, chill you to the bone. Best to go with an English speaking guide."
"You will need at least half a day to walk from the south (Tiananmen Sq.) thru the 5 sections of the Forbidden City, to the north gate. A guide is a must to really appreciate the history and stories that are part of this tour. Access to most of the structures is off limits, though you can view the interior thru opened doors or viewing windows. Usually crowded, but worth the hassle to make your way to the door/window for a peak and a picture."
"This is a must in Beijing. The history is amazing and it reallly shows where the culture of China has came from.

In the center of the city so easy access from everywhere."
"It is a long hike from the South entrance to the North back end, but it is a must do when in Beijing. Do go thru the Museum (free included in the entrance to the Palace). A tour guide would put meaning to all the important areas. Don't neglect the back entrance river and take a lot of pictures. Visit alongside the Tianamen Square."
"With only 3 days to spend in this amazing city, we booked a tour guide from Dragon Delight International Tours and they arranged great tours of Tiananmen Sq, the Forbidden City; a Peking Duck dinner and a Kung Fu show on day 1. Day 2 was spent at the Juyongguan section of the Great Wall - highly recommend this section - then a visit to the Ming Tombs followed by a great local lunch. Late afternoon we had plenty of time to explore the beautiful Summer Palace then spent a wonderful hour wandering around the Olympic site. Our last day started with a fascinating walk around The Temple of Heaven, watching local people exercising and socializing then partaking in a Tea Ceremony before heading south on the bullet train. Tours were well planned and fabulous guide Lucy and her driver were always on time and reliable. Highly recommend this tour company. Andrea & Gwyn, Kalamunda West Australia."
"After seeing Chinese-style roofs, buildings, dragons, lions, statues etc in ""Chinatown"" areas all around the world, our visit to the Forbidden City felt like we were seeing the ""real deal"" for the first time. The intense blue, gold, green and red of the eaves of the roofs is stunning. Useful to go with some background knowledge to fully appreciate what you're seeing."
"Sp big and so much to see - we absolutely loved it. We spent a large part of the day here, but still did not see it all. So impressive and so beautiful."
If you don't have much time in Beijing. Limit your experience here and seek out some of the other parks like Jingshan and Beihai....or even the Hutongs. These courtyards are all concrete and the interior spaces to look at in the Palace are pretty limited.
"I last went in 1998 in spring in midweek and it was fantastic, this time I went on a sunday and it was insane...thousands of shoving,spitting tourists! It was completely unbearable...so go early, and not on a weekend!"
"Absolutely impressive. Don't hesitate to get one of the headphone-tour-guide things, highly recommendable.
It wasn't even that crowdy, but at some point I am just fed up with people who push each other aside all the time."
"quite disappointing I came all the way to see the historical remain of the place. it was
rainy and cloudy day. the hall becomes too dark cant even see anything interior. Why don't they put up some light inside ?"
"Firstly do yourself a favour and read about the history of the palace before u visit, the experience is all the more amazing.

This was a palace that housed emperors and their household for almost 500 years. Surrounded by a 7.9m high wall and 6 m deep by 52m wide moat, there was danger, romance and politics that brought the palace to life. People never left the palace without the emperors permission, for in the eyes of the people he was heavenly and divine (to them). To allow people in would allow them to unmask his truth.

Tempted?

This is one place u have to visit when in China/Beijing, if not for its rich history be sure to visit to reminisce in its architectural splendour.

The place is well known and u will find that most hotels are near. I visited with a tour guide, it was a package (Tiamnenn Square, The Forbidden City and The Great wall- the tour guide threw in some extra's- a stop at the silk factory and Dr. Tea.)

Before u enter the city u will first see Tiamnenn Square, so I suggest that u go for a package with a tour company (these are reasonable priced).

Try Grayline Tours and ask for Chen :)"
"I never realized how big the Forbidden City really is. In the movies, it looked like it had one big couryard, but in reality, there were several outer courtyards leading to the inner palace with ornate pictures and a story about every gate, pillar, statue. You have to do alot of walking so bring walking shoes. We had a great day on the last day of Golden Week so it was crowded, but we're told not as bad as the day/week before. The Forbidden City has several entrances but since we also visited Tianammen Square, we went through the South gates. It is definitely a must visit site while visiting Beijing."
"I liked the Forbidden City but I got ridiculously hot and tired. Don't bother with the audio guides that they rent out. The timing was bad on them, you can't rewind, and the accent was very difficult to understand. Also the information was verrrryyy boring!"
"This is not to be missed, however, you need an English speaking guide to really understand what you're looking at. There is a lot of history here.

And be ready to deal with some large crowds of people. I was visiting middle of October and it was crowded. I can't imagine what it's like during the summer."
"The palace is like a ""Matryoshka doll"" as each hall takes you to an other one and each hall doesnt consist soem thing different then a throne. Though the names of each hall and the reasons they were build were intresting. The garden at the end is amazing. Over all being in the ""home"" of an emperor of an huge culter is enough to pay a visit to forbiden city."
"Another must see in Beijng. Since I first went 3 years ago, visitor numbers have increased massively. You can now only visit in one direction which is a sensible response but does increase queuing times. Might be worth considering what time of the week to visit - saturday am was probably peak time and in some parts you could barely move for the crowds."
"1The emperors, they believed in directions and juxtaposition that can keep their decendents always thriving.
So not only the craftship--- not one nail was used but the pattern, the layout.
Compare to ancient Egypt the scale was smaller.
2 What a pity!The tresures were gone and the palace was a rebuilt . Had better find them in London or Taipei , if you are interested."
What an amazing place to think that only one person who really in charge lived in a huge place like that .. The Palace so beautifull but can still felt the mistique and misterius inside... Take time to explore and enjoy and felt the greatness..
liked it all. get a guide if you want to know more. The sheer expanse and centuries of megalomania is overwhelming
"If you can suspend you irritations with the hoards of tour groups and shear numbers of tourists here (self included) which do take away some of the atmosphere of the place, it is still an enjoyable and very interesting exploration around this historic sight."
"Arrive early, fight the crowds, do what you have to do to get into the Forbidden City, but make this one of the stops on your itinerary. The Forbidden City is as much an architectural marvel as it is an icon of Chinese culture and history. Bring good walking shoes and be prepared for several hours of walking (5 to 6 hours if you want to finish seeing every nook and cranny in the palace). Snacks and water is shockingly expensive inside the palace so make sure to bring your own.

Tip: Independent travelers not willing to wait in line for tickets may consider purchasing them for a small premium from the ticket touts roaming the admission booth. Security guards never seem to bother with the touts, plus this is a way of life in China, so don’t worry, you won’t get into trouble for buying from them. If you speak Mandarin, you can try bargaining with the touts as well."
The Forbidden City is breath taking. Amazing that it is so extensive in size. We visited in October and it was crowded. I can imagine what it would be like during the height of tourist season and the weather is hot and humid.
"Loved walking and exploring the Forbidden City. Could have spent even more hours inside. We did a special tour of a small area with a private guide (no photos allowed) and were up close to some amazing pictures, furniture and artifacts from the last emperor."
"Arrived Sunday morning ,about 9.00am , literally thousands of people on the streets. Very hot, very busy."
The Forbidden City was a very interesting place and definitely worth a visit. Quite a lot of walking as you go in one entrance and walk all the way through to exit the other side.
"What can I say? A must see in Beijing. But don't rush. some of the flanking buildings hold the greatest surprises, so don't just visit the central main buildings. we spent the better part of the day at the city."
"The Forbidden City is enormous and can be daunting. Here is a great way to see it. Start at the northern gate, and get there early. Before you go in, enter the small park directly across the street (Jingshan Gongyuan or Coal Hill Park). Entry is about 2 yuan. Follow the path to the top of the hill (which was made from the rubble excavated while building the Imperial Palace). A 10-15 minute climb up the stairs to the little temple on top will reward you with 360 views and a great view over the Palace itself. It was on this hill that the Emperor or General (I forget which) hung himself at the end of the Ming Dynasty. Then go back down, enter the Forbidden City at the north gate and make your way south.

If you're not really into Ming/Qing history, just let the scale of the place wash over you, and enjoy watching the local crowds (as much a part of the cultural experience of visiting as the building itself). As you make your way south the FC gets bigger and grander until you eventually leave through the main gateway and end up on Tiananmen Square (coming out the tunnel beneath Mao's portrait.

Doing the route this way is more interesting, and you enter the city with a better sense of its scale and context.

Another good thing to do is walk along the moat in the evening."
This area is best appreciated with a guide book and plenty of hours to explore. I was on a tour and although we spent hours here it felt like a whirl wind tour. There is so much to see and we were rushed from location to location. I sometimes wonder exactly what we saw. The inside rooms had extremely dirty windows and people were pushing and shoving to get a view. Hold on to your cameras as mine was almost knocked out of my hands. They should wash the window daily and light up the inside so people can really see what they are looking at. The smog was heavy and the place just seemed dirty. I was excited about seeing the Forbidden City after reading about it and viewing beautiful photos. It was a bit disappointing but I am still happy to have visited this site.
"We went on a Saturday morning. Way too many people to enjoy ourselves, but sights magnificent. We got 3/4 of the way through and couldn't handle the people anymore and got out of there...a nice policeman took us out to the front in his little vehicle, which the kids appreciate as the distances to walk were vast. I thought the palaces in Seoul were way nicer because they had much less people so you had time to enjoy them more (but of course they are on a much smaller scale with a different history). Maybe try going before closing time instead and during the week! Around 60RMB per ticket entry fee then you have to pay extra for any specific sights you want to visit inside. We couldn't get any discount for the kids here even when showing our Chinese residence card! There is no rhyme or reason to this...some sights gave a discount some didn't and no argueing helped!"
"While this venue is always crowded, it is immense. One can become overwhelmed by the magnitude of the complex, but if you break it down into sections it is an incredible experience. If time. allows, break vist into two days. History of the city is awe inspiring. English speaking guide would be critical addition to fully experience. Look for missing door sills where young emperor used to ride his bike!"
"It costs 60 rmb each plus 40 per audio guide. It is incredible too see all the temples in all their Colourful splendour and I liked the marble staircases, however in all honestly it grew tiresome with the huge crowds and few exhibits to view."
"You look at the Forbidden city from Tiannmen square and you think it's just a few very good buildings in amongst some large spacious squares. But when you actually get into the complex you do find plenty of spacious squares with really unique buildings. However the complex goes on for miles and takes at least half a day and some fast walking to see most of the complex of buildings and gardens. The buildings are quite worn down in places and at busy times it can be quite a scrap to look at and take pictures inside some of the buildings. The toilets are a decent standard, they have western style toilets in addition to China style hole in the floor toilets. Overall it's a brilliant sight and extremely unique visit."
"This is the most important place in the history of this country and a great exponent of its culture. The Mao era left some scars on it, but it's still the number one attraction in Beijing."
"Expansive and impressive exteriors, but there is no access inside the buildings; only a limited view into very dark interiors, while literally being pushed aside as hundreds of people are trying to get a view."
"Massive and huge. Visit it for bragging rights. One could imagine, hundreds of years ago, top officers assembling at the main ground, saluting the emperors."
This is not to be missed. The greatness and grandeur of the palace let you be amazed for quite some time. The art and housing are very beautiful. Go there whin in Beijing.
Steeped in history. A great place to visit. Try to get a good English speaking guide and get there early in the morning.
What a historical place..It's busy tourist place..Plan ahead for at least half day trip..Its quite big place..
This was my 5th visit of this great place as I wanted to take some friends who were visiting Beijing for the first time. Always very beautiful and impressive; the only downside of the visit from my part: We arrived there a bit too late as there were big crowds all over. It was a combination of arriving too late in the morning plus the holiday time of the beginning of October as Oct 1 is the celebration of 60 years of communist rule in China followed by a national holiday which last for at least a week (same after My1st which is Labor day).
"The clean, modern underground drops just outside at Tiannamen Sq.
Wide boulevards with hordes of pedestrians sauntering at half my pace. Inside is much quieter and more sedate. Beautiful gardens where many locals come for shade and rest but so big it seems desolate, especially the old quarters which have hardly any visitors apart from photographers and their clients. Great for pics. Souvenirs on offer and I got shanghaied into a student art exhibition, where I hopefully purchased a piece of Chinese art from the next Picasso or Roger Bacon!"
"Spent there more than 3 hours and didn't see a half))) Huge size, really not a palace but the city. Wonder how much does it cost to maintain such historical sight?"
"A top Beijing attraction, the Forbidden City looks exactly like you think it would. It's huge, historical, and will remind you of every movie you've ever seen set in China.

As a head's up, you will walk courtyard to courtyard, and look into (but not enter) various buildings, so the entire visit is outside. I also HIGHLY RECOMMEND going either really late or really early. As we went just before closing (winter hours), the crowds had thinned out- which meant we were able to take a LOT of pictures and we didn't have to press up against a whole ton of other people.

That said, it's pretty cold. I went with a tour group in the late afternoon in March, and though the weather on the streets was okay (~60F/5C) degrees the wind made me feel like it was freezing. Because the buildings seem to create a natural wind-tunnel, wear a couple extra layers. This actually may serve you well if, on the same day, you're also going to the summer palace in the winter months as the attraction is also outside and subject to strong winds from the water."
The Forbidden city is really run down and not being refurbished to keep it in sightseeing condition for the general public.
Not incredibly maintained. It's low season and it was absolutely packed. It's fascinating to see so many tourists and the palace is immense but it's a lot of the same thing. It's sort of a must-see for Chinese history but it's not worth it if you want to have actual fun. I didn't hate it but I rather see something more interesting and vibrant.
nothing to dislike excelent place to visit amazing scale good value for money and you can sopend as long as you want
"It is my understanding the city is modeled after the palace - a series ever larger, roughly, concentric rings. Takes awhile to get to the center, but some amazing artifacts along the way, especially the paved carvings. One can spend many hours here. Can get packed with people on weekends and holidays, really degrades the experience, in my opinion. Don't forget to purchase the tickets when you get inside the first layer so you can keep going, had to go back and get them the first time we visited."
On our Sunday visit this site was jammed like Times Square on New Years Eve. The trek was endless and it all became too much after awhile.
Really interesting some great history and a real insight to how china has evolved. Get there early to avoid the crowds and avoid the hawkers outside as you can purchase anything they have for half the price elswhere.
"You can not come to Beijing without visiting the Forbidden City, This place will blow your mind, it's sheer vastness yet extreme detail to the tiniest piece of carving is unreal. Don't miss!"
"Be prepared for crowds, be prepared for sore feet ... and be prepared for ""Ming Fatigue"".

The Forbidden City is a ""must see"". It's absolutely astonishing in its scale ... and very beautiful too. An amazing place. I walked around it in awe. It's scale takes the breath away ... the Emperors certainly were not lacking in self-importance if they believed that anyone on this earth needed a palace complex on this scale. And one can only guess at the sacrifices made by lesser beings in its construction.

It is a VERY busy attraction. Busloads of people from all over China and the rest of the world flood through its gates. That said, the place is large enough to accommodate many thousand. The trick here is to realize that busloads tend to follow their tour guides slavishly and will proceed in a straight line through the palace complex ... so all you have to do is wander off to either side and you will find much more empty parts of the complex and good photographic opportunities.

Best to accept that you will not see the whole place in a day ... but really half a day is enough to get the flavor. Longer than that and you will get ""Ming Fatigue"" ... an overload of impressive but similar architecture and decoration."
"Anyone will have to be impressed with the sheer scale of this place complex, even with about 50% only open to public, the grand scale would have been imposing to all foreign mercenaries in the past. Along th main axis from the main gate from accross Tainanmen Square, you will witness gates after gates, with humungus squares before you get to arrive at halls after halls where the emperors receive their guests and subordinate. Structures are sp dominant with close to none vegetations. Be sure to wander around the smaller palace quarters where different princes and princesses lived, down to the rear garden with rockeries and theatrettes.
Rent a voice guide device next to gate where they check your ticket, it is multilingual and will tell you stories automatically where you arrive at any particular section.
Some smaller halls are being used to house different exhibitions with extra ticket at the entrance.
Easily spend four hours walking and get you very fit! A feast for photographers, better still if you start in the morning before thousands of tourists fill up all the complex. Plenty of toilets, souvenir shops and drinks in different sections inside."
"Excellent historical location.You need half to a full day.
Lots of walking. Try go on a dry day.
The tour guides are good, lots of info to take in.
Take lots of pics"
"Theres not too much point in launching in to superlatives as you can read them all below but this really is one of the best things to do in China if not Asia. Great history beautiful architecture.

Arrive early!!! We arrived at 8.30 just as the ticket office was opening, the crowds around the entrance and tian'anmen square were beginning to swell and we were thankfull that we had gotten there early. We could walk around quite leisurely in relative peace in the smaller rooms on the west and east sides of the palace, however, when we got back to the main attractions after a couple of hours the crowds were bewildering, at levels that can only be achieved in China and perhaps India. There were masses of people everywhere and this being china everybody was pushing and climbing over one another with little regard for manners or civility. We made a quick turn for the exit.

So worth a visit but avoid weekends and try to be as early as possible.

Entrance fee was 45 Yuan and 40 Yuaif you would also like an audio guide (recommended)."
"We visited the Forbidden city October 2012. I found the history of the place to be very interesting but the place itself was a bit underwhelming. All of the buildings start to look similar after awhile (red with the typical Chinese roof and some Chinese characters and subtle artwork adorning the top). There were a couple of interesting museums on clocks and chinese art within the Forbidden city. The most interesting aspects (places were events took place and the rooms where the emperor stayed) you cannot enter, but must view from a distance. The extreme Beijing smog also took away from the experience. It is certainly a must see while in Beijing given its historical significance, but I found the Summer Palace to be much better."
"There is a reason this place was forbidden, if the ordinary people knew how the elite were living there would have been an uprising. Even the giant bowls full of water to put out fires were originally gold plated. Don't miss this, we paid 60 yuan to enter and 40 yuan for an audio tour. Very interesting, the audio system 'knows' where you are and puts on the appropriate track. The day we went was blue skies, but was not too crowded, so it was easy to take a good look around. Be warned though, there are over 1,000 buildings in the Forbidden City, there is no way you can cover it all in one visit."
"The forbidden city is indeed a beautiful attraction, but I would advise people to see the National Museum of China. The Last Emperor is a better experience to enjoy the forbidden city! Jokes aside, the sheer size of the place and the fact that it was forbidden for so long and beauty of some of the rooms still makes it a worthwhile place to see. Nevertheless, if you're short in time, better choose for the National Museum"
"Still amazing fifteen years after I first saw it, but much much more crowded. If you're not 200 pounds and pushy, you will probably not get to the front of the line to see any of the outer rooms.

That said, if you hang a right after the main courtyard and walk a few hundred yards past the part where the Emperor used to practice his bicycle riding... and buy a separate ticket for the Hall of Jewelry... you will experience a much more peaceful and wonderful tour of the Forbidden City.

And you might even get to see the Love Chamber of the longest-serving emperor and meet the actual 74 year old nephew of the Last Emperor in his calligraphy studio.

Okay, so maybe it wasn't really the Emperor's nephew. But he looked the part... and his calligraphy was nice."
"What an amazing place, such history is being kept alive... Well worth a visit... Wear comfortable shoes, you could be walking around all day... So much to see..."
"Walking through the tall, gigantic red doors at its entrance, with 9 golden knobs spaced-out across and down the surface of the doors was an awesome feeling. All the colour of the buildings and walls was red, adding to the splendour of this ancient palace. What's most amazing was the 16.75 metres' long stone carving (after exiting the 5 palatial building). Those ancient people who planned and built the whole place were indeed most clever. However, since I couldn't walk for too long, I skipped a building or two here and there, as they're more or less similar. But, one still needs to walk on since there's only one exit and it's at the very end. All in all, this is a must-do since it's the oldest palatial structure in the whole world!"
"We visited on October 2nd ie on the second day of the week-long national holidays. We were prepared for the crowds on the entry. We wanted to experience the crowds and we made it. the place was abuzz but not to the extent that we were unable to appreciate the sights of Ancient China. Our excellent guide, Catherine Lu pointed out and explained aspects of the Forbidden City that we would have missed and were duly enriched.
We were in awe as we tried to visualise life or what there is of life behind those walls.
We did not see any litter nor dirtiness. Catherine guided us to the VIP toilets which were of a good standard.
The Forbidden City is a must visit for Beijing. Against the back drop of architectural splendours in Beijing, the Forbidden City is a salute to the past so richly preserved."
"My taxi unfortunately dropped me off at the North Entrance -- you cannot enter here anymore. It was VERY hard to find anyone that spoke English. I walked for close to 40 minutes... I almost left. I then walked (and walked...) to the SOUTH GATE to enter. I ran into a guide on the trolley -- and was glad I did! She was great, and it was worth it --but I would STRONGLY suggest a guide... and remember to ask to go the South Gate to enter."
"Better hire a guide. You can learn about these people's mentality and views. It's a vast area and need to put the time for visiting it. There is a nice garden, too."
"All the old Chinese arcitecture,colours and statues, our quide who told us so much about the dynasties and history that has made me want to read so much more now i am home. there is so miuch to see and when on a tour you havent the time to take it all in"
"We went to forbidden city expecting to experience and see how they went about their daily lives n the palace. But all we experienced was a huge open area, over crowding of people and disgusting dirty public toilets. If you see one building then you have seen them all so there is really no need to walk for over 1 hour to see all the different quarters. It's good to have seen it but I certainly cannot say it was a memorable or enjoyable experience. The Chinese government needs to do more to improve the place as a better tourist attraction, including better crowd control, regular cleaning of toilets, and workshops."
Don't travel here during Chinese holiday season. Try going either really early in the morning or in the evening just before it closes to avoid the crowds.
Wonderful. End the visit by Jingshan park (if you still have the energy!) and climb the stairs to get a view from the top. You can really appreciate the size of the Forbidden city from there.
"600 years of history and atmosphere. Beautiful colours and architecture, and a great place to people-watch as well, as you see the amazement on other people's faces."
"Well, this is one of the best conserved places in china. The audio guide is a must if u dont have a tourist guide. Try to go very early, because is over packed all time. I did love it !!!"
Too crowded. Recommend to go there now as summer should be very hot and hard coz it requires lot of walking
take your time and enjoy the grounds. Avoid some of the crowds by going right or left to some of the less popular areas. Anyone with an interest in history or architecture must visit.
"Get your photo with Mao outside in the front and then go to Lama Temple instead. This place is HUGE inside and you will walk for miles to see boring cement. Too much space and not enough content.

Might want to go across the street to visit Mao's tomb while you are in the area."
"The Forbidden City is a must-see for travellers to Beijing. It houses a multitude of buildings and gives a wonderful insight into the life and times of the old Chinese emperors. As one stands within its walls and hears the tales of times gone by, the imagination can really take over. As with a lot of historical places in China, there are many steps and lots of walking around this place, but it is easily achievable. If you love history, then this is the place to be."
"Loved the Forbidden City. The afternoon we decided to go,there was a huge thunderstorm with heavy droplets of rain and lightening. By the time we commenced walking through the storm was almost over. Not too many peeps around and seeing the Forbidden City in a differant light added a new dimension to the visit. The day was cool and I really enjoyed strolling at my leisure and not having to rush. Just absorbed the atmosphere and history. Considering this was the start of the week long public holiday I was surprised the rain kept many visitors away but for me it just added another element of enjoying this amazing place."
a must visit place if visiting beijing. a wonderful historic place. please avoid long public holidays to visit this place as it can be over-crowded!
"A much bigger area than I expected. Mostly all outdoors. You need quite a few hours to walk around this vast area. There is a fee at the entrance, 60 yuan. Not too crowded as we were there following Golden Week fortunately. Wear good walking shoes, it's a vast area."
"It is always very nice to visit such places to have a feeling of what happened sometime in history. Definitely worth a visit.
Would have loved to see Turandot opera on the palace settings."
To see how the emperor lived with all his staff is unbelevable. What a great cicilisation the chineas had during this period.
"Every time I see this place on the television it reminds me of my visit. The enormity of the palace just can't be captured without walking around it first. Whilst many of the artefacts have been stolen or have disappeared, there are quite a few which have been restored and the maintenance is impeccable. I would suggest going early in the morning, as it is a very long day and can get quite tiring. I would not visit Beijing without a trip to the Gu Gong."
Another great stop off on our tour. Much larger than we expected with lots of history and ancient architecture.
"Visiting the Forbidden City is something all visitors to Beijing do, and you'll probably be no exception to this. But I found it a bit like a visit to the Statue of Liberty - I was very pleased to have gone there, but a bit underwhelmed by the experience itself."
Get a tour guide. We used the electronic guide & information was well relayed but think we would have gained more from a guide!
"Once in a lifetime experience. A must go. Suggest you hire a local guide to bring you around the palace so you can understand the history and culture of the palace structures and buildings. If you enjoy history, this will probably take up 3/4 of your day to ensure you cover most of the important areas in the palace. Please wear comfortable shoes as it is walking thru the entire palace."
A long walk past the 999 rooms of the palace. Some great photos though and the history is fascinating.
"We were told prehand that the place was really huge and with little to no shade or trees available, and that's correct, the place is huge (to say the least)! You can really feel the vibe the emperor wanted you to feel, that there's little to no place to hide and that his might and power is vast. The buildings all look really beautiful and majestic, not visiting the Forbidden City would be like not having visited Beijing, a must see for everyone who travels there."
Thank goodness I had a tour guide. This place is massive. The stories my guide told me of how things were had me so engrossed. Great to visit.
"The Forbidden City was a little bit of a let down for us. It is beautiful and captures nicely Chinese history and culture. However, you pay 60yuan to enter when you can walk down a few back streets and come across something twice as authentic and with the locals still living there and partaking in everyday life. We have been spoilt as we have visited many beautiful small Chinese Towns. The Forbidden City is definately spectacular but the Jingshan Park was our favourite part of the city."
"Enormous, crowded with Chinese, but worth it. We did go to Jinshan park before to see the overview and that makes a real difference or you just can not grasp the enormity. It is a must see and try to visit the displays in side buildings as they are interesting. Go early or late as there are always lots of people."
"China has over a billion people living there and it shows. The forbidden city has hundreds of thousands of visiters a day! If you go during the middle of the day like I did on a hot day, you will not enjoy it. There is alot of walking to do once you get in the complex and each building will look the same.

I will say that complex itself is huge and incredible in that regard. To imagine that no one was allowed into the city at one point in unbelievable.

Take my advice and go VERY EARLY to truly breathe in the atmosphere without people breathing down your neck and your skin boiling because of the heat"
"Amazing history lesson! Certainly not the quietest day out but well worth the admission fee. Good idea to take the electronic guide because you can take everything in at your own pace and because it works via GPS, you don't miss a thing."
It was fascinating to hear the history and see the extent of this amazing place. Spend some time just to take in the atmosphere and beauty of the Forbidden City.
"but SO many people! Hard to really view everything but we happened to be there with out tour group on their National Day so it was a mob scene. Had to stick together like ""sticky rice"" - but we made it, thanks to our excellent group leader. Definitely worth a walk through. Will now rent ""The Last Emporer"" to refresh my memory of scenes we actually saw. Worth the walk."
"Needless to say this is one of the major attractions for a good reason, both due to the beautiful architecture and the history of the place. So let me just add one thing to all the reviews that are already on here: The audioguide is not worth spending money on. If you buy the little leaflet with a map being flogged near the ticket booths, you get the same text (often literally) in writing.

That saves you the major annoyance of the audioguide: It is activated automatically as you walk past a building - but it switches off by itself too if you take some steps back to look, and you cannot replay a track once it has started playing.

So unless you religiously stick to the route outlined, you get a lot of half-played tracks, starting by themselves as you pass this buiding on the way to the loo or that building while you're just strolling through the grounds."
main (first) palace closed to public. cordless electronic guides turn on by themselves sometimes only when you are v close- I took mine back first thinking broken. only moderate info. lots of stuff to see and for me the jade was number one. not sure all the gold and jewels are genuine but buildings are most impressive and as always chinese staff and public are so friendly. everyone has a ready smile even in this tourist hotspot.
"I can not believe the volume of people that can cram into the same space. People are extremely rude and pushy and my 10 y/o daughter was actually knocked about by adults! There was no orderly conduct what so ever. The Palace looks old and worn and there are no barriers to keep people back. Very sad! I think I would have enjoyed it more if it wasn't raining and muggy and sticky people pushing up against me. Yuck! If you can figure out a time that there are less visitors, it would be a better experience. Still awesome to see but not on such a crowded day."
I watched the film The Last Emperor prior to our visit and was still blown away with the awesomeness of it all. Chinese antiquity at its best.
"The place is so large that you cannot give it justice with only a few hours.

Colours so magnificent despite there age.

very peaceful gardens with fantastic aray of Bonsi treas"
"Prepare to push yourself through crowds of people. Many of the people that goes to this place don't know common manners, and specially not how to be in a line to wait for something."
Unfortunately we got rushed round the Forbidden City as we were on a tour party but we would very much like to have spent longer there and had a good guide. I felt we missed much of what was there and must now sit down and watch The Last Emperor again! Suggest you take your time there and allow a couple of hours minimum.
"The place gives one a sense of China's majesty, its history and the people who made it great. Even with the rush of people (we visited at the height of the Autumn Festival) we could still imagine the grandeur of the Emperors and the court, the palace intrigues, the glory and the power... The courtyards are amazing, the architecture wondrous. The displays could do with a bit more descriptions though. A visit to Beijing is definitely incomplete if one does not see the Forbidden City. Now one is inspired to (again) see Bertolucci's film."
"Watch the film the Last Emperor then visit the city. You wont be dissappointed - huge square after square after square with lovely pavillions and lovely gardens at the end.,"
"Very cool history and artwork.
I learned the most on this guided tour than any other I went to.
Remember 1420! lol"
Go to Temple of Heaven instead. The way Imperial Palace was built is like a repitition of the same courtyards after courtyards with all locked rooms. We were dissappointed to find them all close to public. All we experienced was the pushing and elbowing. Even for a quick walking through was almost impossible particularly in the bag check area where all people jammed and pushed in. It was surely a new experience. We arrived almost midday- and happened to be during holiday week. We entered via a side garden where we paid a small fee to walk thru and walked to Behai Park via underground from the exit of Forbidden City. There was a lady selling a map in front of the ticket counter- but inside the palace there were more people giving away smaller maps - with advertisements on it. I don't see the point of learning the name of each room where we cannot see inside them.
"Everything in Beijing was big and the Forbidden City was not exception. Be prepared for lots of walking, lots of very loud Chinese tour groups. We went in the morning and planned to get the audio tour. You have to go through the first few gate first before you get the audio tour but it was great. It did cut in and out a bit and my husband and I got a little out of sinc but we found it much better as we could go at our own pace and not have to worry about keeping up with a guide.
If you use the Audio Guide - try to get away from the large groups as it is a little hard to hear. Once we diverged to the right or left of the main track it is better.
Food: I would suggest that if you are doing the city on your own that you take your own lunch as the choose is quite limited. We ate in air conditioning near the entrance to the clock and it was nice to cool down and sit down.
A truly amazing place"
"no doubt the city area is imposing but it seems to be a row of small similar looking buildings with huge courtyards. The architecture was also similar. Since there are hardly any artefacts and very little information (even though they have a beautiful audio automated guide), the grandeur which is visible in palaces in Europe and India was quite missing here. Of course every visitior should make a trip to the forbidden city but I think two hours are more than enough."
The Forbidden City is one of the most amazing places to see in China because of the history behind it. The area covered by the city is huge and requires half a day to have a reasonable look around. The dislikes are that you will have to share the experience with everyone else as it is very crowded. You are not allowed to enter the buildings within the Forbidden City as most are roped off and you can just view from behind the roped areas. It is best to go when it first opens at 8.30am and will cost around Y60.
I could not say I enjoyed the Forbidden City. It was much of the same which went on and on. My friend and I however spotted people dressed up and realised you could make a DVD as if you were flying over Beijing. It cost 60 Yuan but we still giggle now!
"This place is enormous, and sadly a lot of the more interesting rooms are not open to the public. Most of the buidlings that are open are the same. You could in fact spend a whole day here, but it was extemely busy with people pushing everywhere, and after a few hours of feeling like we were seeing the same thing over and over we called it quits. We went across the road and did some people watching in Tiananmen Square. Much more enjoyable."
Forbidden City is massive and beautiful. It was packed with people and came with audio sets (which sometimes overwhelmed me rather than helped me understand). I would recommend seeing it but go early and only spend a few hours.
"The imperial palace (or palaces) of the ancient emperors of China is not to b e believed. The site is huge but you can get through the buildings that are open in two hours. Right across from Tianmen Square, it is an interesting part of Chinese history. You must pay to get in but it is well worth the $9 USD entry fee. Another Beijing site that should not be missed."
"Again our guide explained every aspect of this amazing place,and the surrounding waters,It is so big take good walking shoes.You can get a small open bus to the end it is a long walk and only $1.worth it."
Not very interesting when you arrive from the enterance at Tianenmen Square but once you get in the size of the place is incredible. You move from one amazing building to another. Very interesting to see how the emperors and their households lived.
"Yes the Forbidden City is large! The size of the palace is such that you should place to spend a couple of hours there. They have a decent cafeteria and several touristy shops. It is big enough that even if you could investigate a number of rooms, it would be a very large undertaking. I was impressed with the detail work on the stone and roof lines. Such time and care went into this palace. Well worth the visit. The palace may be very crowded, so it may be wise to adjust your patience level accordingly......"
"if you are interested in historical places and want to learn about history, give this place a full day. It is amazingly huge and mysterious. Get a map sometime before visiting and read & plan accordingly. Don't forget to keep water bottles and a nice pair of shoes as you will have to walk a lot."
"I have seen many Chinese films using Forbidden City for background. And last year i deceided to come there. Woa! Not different much with film's scene. I assume if you are going to Beijing, you will be going to Forbidden city. It is worth the hype, although all the megaphoned-chinese tour groups totally ruin the ambiance. It is their country, so no way around it, I guess."
"Initially forbidden city is gorgeous, then you get inside. It's all the same and the government have been lazy by not creating any exhibitions, galleries or interesting signs. After about 5 minutes and a cole of photos we were bored. Easily accessed by metro though so worth a quick look. Take water and snacks."
"We went to the forbidden city which was in walking distance from our hotel. I must say it wasn't what I expected, not much to see other than empty closed off buildings and if you want to go in to see any of the artifact they are in other building that is an extra fee to get in. Plus this was my first introduction to what would be the norm for the remainder of my trip the washroom which is basically a hole in the floor."
"God, but it's big. You start off stunned, moving through astounded and poleaxed, before finally realising that it is somehow bigger than the bit of Beijing that it supposedly fits in. Even the most seasoned sightseer will ultimately decide that he/she can't be bothered to look at any more of it and move off to search for a cab. One of the must-dos of Beijing, but be aware that you will be knackered from all the walking. Top tip - if someone tells you they're an art student and asks you to view their paintings with no obligation to buy, tell them to take a hike."
"Loved everything, 60 RMB for admission, leave a whole day for this place as there is so much to see,and take lunch and drinks in with you."
Be prepared to spend a good few hours there (more likely whole day) if you are interested in visiting and reading about every building. It is massive and we got lost even though we had a map. Interesting part of Chinese culture.
Very big area and pretty nice. Shows how wealthy China was in the ancient times both monitory wise and culturally. Absolute must visit for every one going to Beijing. Need aminimum of 3.5 hours to visit. Closes at 5:00 p.m. so plan accordingly.
"The buildings are really remarkable considering that it was built for many years and well preserved. But the structures are the same from the first building down to the last building, if you will have your photos taken from the first just don't bother to have the succeeding photos on the next ones because it looks the same, except for the things inside the individual rooms, the things the emperor used and even the things of the many concubines. If you are an artist you will not appreciate this architecture, but if you are a historian you will like this place. be sure to use walking shoes because of the long walk into the palace. The place is quite gloomy and dark, no new polishing or paint, i think they should restore it with fresh paint so it will look more attractive."
"I enjoyed this place, tons of buildings with golden sealings, lot of history and very well care. I recommend to read some of history before going to make the experience more enjoyable. You can hire a guide as well, but they are a little bit expensive, therefore, a wikipedia read the night before could be save few bucks in your pocket. Do not forget to go to the mount in front the exit to get the best panoramical view of the city."
"We had gone to visit the forbidden city as part of a travelsphere tour. The site has 9,999 rooms we only saw a handful of rooms and was slightly disappointed, I could have spent a day here, we had three hours. I purchased a book so will read about what I missed, but what I did see was awsome...."
"Just too many people. I'm sure it would be better in the middle of winter, which is the only time I'd go back. The lack of crowd control (e.g., single-line viewing of palace interiors through the doors/windows) means mob mentality. Do not go here if you have young children, are physically disabled in any way, or are prone to want to belt the next person who elbows you aside seeking a better view."
Best place to see China History of Ming/Qing Dynasty. The museum inside in nice and the exhibition item is marvelous. Avoid going during weekend/China golden week as it will be very very crowded.
"This is a huge World Heritage monument that you would need a day to really tour the inner sanctum of the Forbidden City. Another ""must see"" place but never go without a tour who would give you the history of the place."
This was a very large area and hard to imagine when it was actually being lived in. China is working very hard at maintaining their heritage and the place is spotless
"A lovely place to people watch. Some amazing photographs to be had, with lots of colour in the temples."
"Definitely a place to see. But somewhere you will only do once.
It does get very crowded. And make sure you hire a guide to explain the history behind the city. Otherwise it might just seem like a bunch of buildings."
This is a pinnacle achievement on par with Stirling Palace for purpose and grandeur or any of the other great castles worldwide. There is still alot to see inside although much was stolen and hidden away by whomever. I visit this place everytime I am in Beijing.
Very interesting but lots of tourists -- be prepared to have to shove your way into see things. Make sure you go with an English speaking guide if you don't speak Chinese because we couldn't find any English pamphlets.
We have visited the Forbidden City twice. A 2 hr visit on an organised tour last year which went up the west side whet our appitite to return to the Forbidden City and spend a full day exploring this huge complex of palaces and courtyards. This year we spent over 6 hours there and would highly recommend a visit that includes all the museums and the 9 Dragon Wall.
fantastic place to visit hard to believe someone built this city for themselves vast in size you need good walking shoes on as hard under food takes at least two hours to walk from being to end worth every step.
We travelled with our children - 5 and 3. Free entry for kids less than 120cm tall so that was nice!
"I was not prepared for the sheer size of the Forbidden City. The crowds as you would expect are massive and mostly Chinese. It just went on and on in parts through paved courtyards, which all pretty much looked the same. We had some lunch in the little cafe there it was okay. The best part is at the end where it becomes a series of gardens. Where comfortable shoes and be prepared for lots of people. Drinks are available through out for purchase."
"Be prepared to be jostled and pushed around for an hour to an hour and a half. A long walk, but worth it."
"Huge city, full of history, very well preserved and for sure the best stop in Beijing!!!
the entrance is going through painting at this time!"
"You should have a guide when you do the Forbidden City otherwise you will miss out on historical facts and you wont know what half the place is or you will miss all the nooks and cranny`s. Again the architecture is just amazing for the years it was built. Go early to avoid the big crowds. My slide shows from Beijing
[--]"
"The place is huge and I think you'll need more than a day to cover the whole place.

Need to wear comfortable shoes as a lot of walking from start to the end. Also put on a cap or you can buy one from those vendors outside the palace costing only RMB10. Vending machines are available at strategic locations.

A lot of the important places are out of bound to visitors but one can take photo of them just outside the main doors.

A great place to learn about the history of the Ming and Qiong dynasties of China!!!"
"So many itineries allocate only 2-3 hours for here; however, that will only let you see half, at best. This should be a focal point of a day, not one of three sites to visit in a day if you'd like to see more than just the main halls and perhaps the garden in the back.

There is a great audio guide available for rental, and we got two; however, we probably could have hired a guide for the cost of both of them. The 9 Dragon Screen is a seperate cost; there is another in the adjacent park included in the park's admission.

You may be able to avoid some of the crush of people by beginning in the back, north gate, and working your way down to the south gate, but the trade off to this is not getting the full visual impact of seeing it the way a distinguished visitor would have seen it when arriving, which is quite impresive indeed."
"Make sure to make time for this. I recommend the audioguide so you can learn something while you walk around. A must see, recommend early morning to avoid the bigger tour groups"
Walking into each courtyard was just breathtaking. With 9999 rooms it is hard to beat anything quite so grand in China ( Great wall aside). Kids enjoyed learning about the emporers and their lives .
"Our tour of the Forbidden City was sadly not long enough as we were part of a Tour Group! To do this wonderful site justice you need to take a full day. There is so much to see, so many spectacular palaces, temples and gardens. The site is packed with people so do NOT go at a weekend if you can avoid it. If you are not part of a tour, hire a guide, it is difficult to explore this place by reading a guide book, there is just too much to see. When you have visited it go home and re-watch the film The Last Emperor!"
"It is money well spent to hire a guide. You can do this infront of the Palace, just confirm price before the tour. Make sure your guide's english is up to par or you will lose a lot of info while trying to decipher what was said. But this is a big place and you will waste a lot of time if you don't know what you are looking at- especially if you've already seen your share of temples and palaces."
This is a trully amazing site but it takes a whole day at least to do it justice. Amazing history and it is probably better done with a guide and take your camera.
we had a wonderful trip to the forbidden city. our tour guide was very knowledgeable and friendly. the site itself is amazing and in such respected condition. its s must see :)
It is beyond my imagination how excessive and enclosed the emperor lived. It may be useful to have a guide here - my guide took the opportunity to talk about how the capitals moved in China in history. There were many interesting stories told in different areas of the Imperial Palace. We couldn't take a very good photo because it was soooo crowded. Get ready to jostle with the crowd to take a peek into the room. Long walk. Prepare drinking water. Female toilet: cubicle door - yes. seated toilet - yes. cleanliness - 4/5 stars.
"This is one of those places that you simply cannot miss if you visit China. It is just so impressive and overwhelming in its magnitude. It was extremely crowded on the day that we attended but we were lucky to have a great guide, Henry from ""Stretch a Leg"", to traverse the crowds and take us to the less crowded areas as well as ensure that we still saw it all. One really needs a guide to make the history of this magnificent place come alive and ensure that it does not merely become just another tourist attraction."
interesting history attached. too many people. obviously a great area in the middle of the city and is a must to visit if in Beijing.
"As it's on the tourist trail, you can't not see it, but it is very overcrowded. I was also surprised at the sheer size of it all, and the number of sections. Allow at least 2 to 3 hours"
"The size of this place is mind blowing. You cant really get an idea until you are there. It is just amazing and you have to see it if in town. It is very crowded however so be prepared. I would also recommend a guide of some kind so you will know what you are looking at. I heard from our guide for example that there are so many rooms in the palace that if a baby was born and slept in a different room every night , the baby would be 27 years old by the time they slept in every room. Also test your guides english before hiring them because the average spoken English skills are not very good. I had a hard time understanding most of our guides."
Because we were with a tour we only got to see the first courtyard. Would have loved to go further. Great place full of history!
"I hesitated on whether to give this a ""very good"" or ""average"" rating. It's obviously the primary iconic attraction in Beijing - and for that, it's a must see. But...try not to expect too much. The architecture, the painting and design and the colors are magnificent. But what you'll quickly find is that you're walking from one huge courtyard to the next with similar cookie cutter buildings throughout...and this goes on for awhile as the Forbidden City is huge. Once you get to the living quarters - you have to peer through dirty windows to see the ancient antiques as they were left many years ago. You'll see dust pilled high in every room. I finally asked our tour guide why everything was so dirty and he didn't understand what I was asking (or perhaps didn't have a good answer). We talked to some friends who also went to the Summer Palace (we did not go) but they said it was very similar. I may suggest you pick one of the other but perhaps not both as you'll feel like you're seeing very similar things. Overall, a bit disappointed."
"The Forbidden City was huge. There are many photo opportunities, but be careful. The people can be a little rude and very pushy. Just keep in mind that this is their culture, and you will be fine."
"Its à must do when in Beijing, But they didnt have student duscount and it was very crowded. Probably better with guide, otherwise you get à bit fed up with The buildings when you dont really know what everything is. All The people trying to sell stuff also takes Downs The feeling. Dont get fooled by The taxis outside - they dont use meter and try to give you process thats 5 Times higher than normal"
the last emperor was always on my mind when i visited the palace.most people have seen the movie and i could not believe that i was actually there!
We were lucky to have a guide using vox earphones. There are so many people and so much to see and photograph. A long trip for the able bodied but those who van not walk so well can hire a wheel chair and someone to push I think it was about £50 covering a 4 hour period but probably well worth it. The buildings are staggering and in such good condition. The guide was able to relay the history but I suggest reading up before you go would be helpful.
"We took a guide and were in a group of foreigners. Without the guide it would have been quite dull as all the splendor has been removed after the last emporer fell meaning you get dusty room after dusty room with a single throne occupying the centre. One colleague commented ""it has a cooky cutter feel"" which was quite apt. Nothing is restored meaning that the buildings look a bit run down (maybe there is a reason for this but re-painting would add immensely to the experience). The windows looking into the buildings definately needed a clean as there were a thousand grubby hand marks smeared over them. The museum with the wedding dresses and artifacts was the highlight of what we saw (although we were in a bit of a rush but spent 1.5 hours looking around). The story surrounding the place is surreal considering that the place was functioning till the early 20th century .. but does paint a culture that has an pre-ordained place for all citizens and was harsh."
"These months are the school vacation months for Chinese children, and it seemed like every family went to see the Forbidden City. It was jammed. And you can no longer go inside any building. Some doorways are open so you can look inside, but the jam of people trying to get to the doors was crushing - think Japanese subway."
Let me just say that thsi is a place yopu must visit. The TV shows do this place no justice. The colores are breathtaking and the majestic. The people are a little rude and pushy but that is the culture. This place is so huge that it will take you hours to explore it. There are lots of shops to buy things while there also. The history in this place is something you must experience at least once!
"This is a huge site with wonderful photo oportunities at every turn.
Historic, fascinating, beautiful, so interesting.
Do not miss this when in Beijing."
Be prepared with comfortable shoe and clothing; dont carry much load; take all day; and get a great sense of life in a spectacular culture in a time inconceivable to modern man. This is a must see; the preservation of almost a thousand years of human civilization is no small wonder; the accompanying history and recreation makes this worth the small entry free. Do it no matter what.
"It is really nice to see the Forbidden City. Before you enter for the first time it's hard to believe how big it is and that it really is a city. But it seems like it never ends.
The Forbidden City is well kept and something you shouldn't miss when you visit Beijing. It is really beautiful."
"It is a really very big place and involves so much walking! And be prepared for the crowds and the sun. We started for the Forbidden City around 2.00 pm. There are really long lines for the tickets. Don't buy maps at the ticket counter entrances. You can get free ones inside. Hiring a guide or an audio guide will cost money. So if you don't want to spend, it is better to do a little research about this place before coming and choosing what you would like to see. If you want to see everything in the forbidden city, you would need more than a day.
The brackets on the roofs, the colors used on the walls, the calligraphy, worksmanship involved in the construction, etc are magnificent and worth a look. You walk through many gates, halls and pavilions (gets repetitive after a while) before reaching the Inner Court. I loved the Imperial Garden (it is such a welcome sight for eyes worn out after seeing so many buildings). For people interested in culture and history, more time is needed. We wanted to exit via the Meridian Gate (south) entrance itself and so we returned the way we entered around 4.30 pm. All the crowds had disappeared and we had the huge courtyards to ourselves! It was great. So an ideal time to visit would be 2.5 hours before closing time. Also, this way, afterward, you can spend some time at the Tianenmen Square and see the Flag-lowering ceremony at sunset."
"Amazing to see the Forbidden City - so vast an area with so much history. Make sure you wear sensible shoes - it is relatively flat for most of the visit, but is paved and quite hot with little areas to sit in the shade. You are able to buy drinks and food if you like - a few souvenir shops located within both areas. It is easy to enter from the T Square side and continue through - close to buses and the subway. You really need to read about the Forbidden City before you go, as not much information is provided at the attraction. There are guides providing private or group tours if you prefer. Enjoy!"
Worth seeing and having a guide. A lot to take in and can become a little repetitive. Take half a day or more.
"To fully appreciate the cultural significance of the Forbidden City, it is important to do a small amount of reading in advance of your visit to Beijing. Once you are more familiar with the multiple dynasties and the rich history, your time at the Forbidden City will be worthwhile investment.
For sure, go early to avoid the crowds. Also, don't stick to the beaten path. Be sure and visit the temples and pavilions to the left and right of the primary buildings. There in much to see there, too and typically are less populated with other tourists. Bring a boxed lunch from your hotel, as dining options are few. After finishing, hike to the top of the hill in the park opposing the Forbidden City for a view that will provide the full scale and size of the City. Enjoy!"
"I've been to the Forbidden City a few times now. For anyone visiting Beijing and somewhat familiar with Chinese history, this is certainly a place you'll want to visit. I will say that the palace is clearly missing some of the grandeur that I'm sure it had (it does appear quite empty walking through). I would recommend visiting on a cooler day, as it can be very hot in the sun and there is very little shade in between the sections (thankfully the pass throughs of the walled sections offer some shade). The garden at the end of the palace is always a pleasant surprise.

As an obvious foreign, I will say it does get annoying being constantly approached to buy every tacky item imaginable, but there's not much that can be done to avoid this."
"Forbidden city is for the powerful and emperor. It is forbidden to normal citizens.

One this city is opened to peasants and we are all on awe on the extravagance of ancient emperor.

A must visit. Enjoy the buildings, the colors, the dragons, the ground. Imagine yourself living in such a secluded wonderment."
"you can go with guide or by yourself, but better with guide. couple hours is enough to run through, but half day is better to explore it without rush"
It's hard to visualise what life was like in its heyday. The size and the architecture is very impressive though. But quite crowded in some spots.
Most of the inside of the forbidden city has Ben stolen by marauding savages and the French over time. As a result it is all a little dull!
