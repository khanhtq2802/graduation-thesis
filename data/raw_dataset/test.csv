Some buildings have been destroyed during the several wars.,all-2 ch-2
The citadel is definitely worth taking a look at but to get the most out of the experience get the audio guide.,all-1 amn-1
The palace grounds are much smaller and more intimate than Gyeongbokgung Palace - and definitely not as crowded.,all-1
I admit I'm a Korean historical drama fanatic.,all-1

"Make sure to try hanbok when you go (it was around ₩15,000 for 4 hours and the rental store that I went to was right across the street from Chandeokgung), as it authenticates the experience!",all-1 amn-1
The secret garden is worth the 5000won as you can see a different part of the palace and there will be guide touring you around.,all-1 amn-1 nat-1

The Imperial City was badly damaged in the American/Vietnam war and as a result most of the Imperial City was damaged or even destroyed.,all-2 ch-2
The secret garden is ok but truly a very long walk and especially not for those too tired after visiting other areas in Seoul.,all-3
"There appears to be only one exit to one side, but well worth finding the old gardens not far from the exit (although it's not well signposted) as there is a cafe there serving drinks and food in lovely peaceful surroundings.",all-3 amn-1 mgt-2 nat-1

Hue is full of scammers.,all-2 amn-2 ppl-2
!The site has very poor signs and is not easy to know where you are once you are in because it is too big.,all-2 mgt-2
