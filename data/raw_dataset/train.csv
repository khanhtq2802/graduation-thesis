They look extremely depressed and sick.,all-2
"A Sad Disappointment, I was looking forward to visiting the Citadel/Imperial City.",all-2
But quite a disappointment inside as most of the palace were destroyed during the war....,all-2 ch-2
Then along came the wars and so much of it was damaged.,all-2 ch-2
"So the King never sleep here, not have the buildings ever been truly occupied.",all-0
We were soaked in sweat and 10 of us saw a place to buy a drink under a covered area.,all-3 amn-1 nat-2
This was the most incredible surprise on our journey to Hue.,all-1
You can only visit Huwon by tour and there are strict rules to stick with your tour group of 40-50 people so you can't explore by yourself and there's always tons of people milling around--definitely makes for a less-than-peaceful experience.,all-2 amn-2
I liked the fact that the temples are blended perfectly with the surrounding forest and the amazing colors of buildings.,all-1 ch-1 nat-1
Lots of overgrown plants etc.,all-2 nat-2 mgt-2
"This was my second visit, and I was pleasantly surprised to see so much progress.",all-1 mgt-1
"We thoroughly enjoyed our visit to the Citadel, just prepare yourself with lots of water, comfortable shoes, and snacks!",all-1
"The tickets are very expensive, do not include an audio guide and it is plain boring.",all-2 amn-2
The only thing i didnt like about this place was that they place the souvenir shop inside some of the ancient building.. and that they take 150 K for foreigner to entry this place vs. 130K for locals,all-2 amn-2 mgt-2
"This place is huge, interesting to learn the way of life and see some of the artwork and read about the history, enormous and so interesting.",all-1 ch-1
far too much money to get in and you defo need a tour guide to get the most out of this site.,all-3 amn-3
We spent a few hours in awe of the amazing infrastructure.,all-1 ch-1
Some buildings were destroyed in the war.,all-2 ch-2
"I say this because unfortunately our visit was marred by witnessing rude, unprofessional staff saying with VERY angry tone and aggressive body language; “cover, cover” or “no shoes, no shoes”.",all-2 amn-2 ppl-2
It was a bright sunny minus 18 degrees celsius day when I wandered through the grounds of Changdeokgung Palace.,all-1 nat-1
We felt we didn't want to pay for an audio guide (100k for one) - we had the internet and there were quite a few signs with English information.,all-3 amn-2 mgt-1
"Everything is tourist price, and one of the best things is to bring your own water and drinks.",all-2 amn-2
And it's just sad to know that a cultural legacy was destroyed by a war.,all-2 ch-2
I think If you just see one temple in Seoul this needs to be the one!,all-1
The return is via freeway so quicker and includes an impressive 6.3km road tunnel through the mountains.,all-1 mgt-1
good locaton to see sunset.,all-1 nat-1
Free guides in multiple languages point out key points and very helpful.,all-1 amn-1
"It started pouring, I mean POURING rain when we got to this palace just before noon but that did not dampen our spirits.",all-3 nat-2
"I arrived just in time for an English language tour of the palace (just under an hour) followed by a 90 min tour of the ""secret garden"" and think I benefited from doing the tours as opposed to simply walking around n my own.",all-1 amn-1
The number of places is limited to 50 in each tour and mine was full so it is worth the effort of reserving in advance.,all-0
"As with any other designs of the ancient buildings in Vietnam, the design is heavily influenced by the five elements (earth, metal, wood, water, fire) and also doors and entrances based on the royalty protocols (middle entrance is always for the King) while side doors are for the mandarins and horses and elephants.",all-1 ch-1
The entire back of the Imperial city was damaged after the war and cannot be fixed.,all-2 ch-2
Saw changing of the guards. Buildings are very interesting and seem to be in the middle of Seoul. If you can go with a guide or someone knowledgeable it makes the visit far more informative. Prepare to spend a couple of hours,all-1 ch-1 amn-1
You can see scrumb sections of the inner walls riddled with bullet holes.,all-2 ch-2
After reading great reviews of the place I was bitterly disappointed walking in.,all-2
We skipped the Secret Garden tour though as we only had a few hours in Seoul but can imagine that this is also a great tour in spring and summer without the snow we had now in January.,all-3 nat-1
I booked the secret garden tour and the guide is very funny and nice.,all-1 amn-1 ppl-1
Didn't enjoy it and will not return.,all-2
Our visit to the Citadella proved to be extremely interesting.,all-1
This is a fantastic site.,all-1
"If you come early on the morning, you hear the birds singing and hear the nice sound of the wind, so if you are a nature lover this is your spot.",all-1 nat-1
"The tour guide we had knew her stuff and could speak decent English, but was impatient to finish the tour and so she kept hurrying us along and would start talking before everyone caught up.",all-3 amn-3 ppl-3
"Well, maybe right since Noi Dien was under restoration when we were there in August but we couldn’t help it because we were tourists from abroad who can’t come here often.",all-1 mgt-1
If you want to stay for a while take your own food and drink as the shops inside are very limited.,all-2 amn-2
Geumcheongyo Bridge is the oldest bridge in Seoul and dates back to 1411.,all-1 ch-1
you can visit the museum for free.,all-1 amn-1
"Also if you want a guide, which is probably wise to get the full history, go in the morning because they go home before lunch.",all-1 amn-1
To be fair a cyclo ride was probably the best option for us to see as much of Hue as we could in the 3 hours of daylight available to us.,all-1 amn-1
"I would recommend the secret garden tour, but there’s steep hills and stairs so don’t take the elderly here!",all-3 nat-1
"With this one, you can roam freely and explore until your heart is content.",all-1
All the wars have helped to demolish a large part.,all-2 ch-2
Wear comfortable shoes to walk in.,all-0
"There are places to buy beverages and the average price of a drink is 50,000Vnd.",all-1 amn-1
"Price was less than $4 for the self tour, not inclusive of the secret garden.",all-1 amn-1
"When we turned down his 'kind' offer and rode off on flat tyres, he followed us like a hound, shouting that what we were doing was extremely dangerous.",all-2 ppl-2
"Entry is 200,000 (without an audio guide, which is an extra 100,000) and this gets you access to all parts of the imperial city.",all-3 amn-3
"A word of warning though, the secret garden is not an easy stroll across manicured lawns, and while those with average levels of health will find it easy enough...",all-2 mgt-2 nat-2
Sadly much of the area is overgrown with relics of the past under the grass.,all-2 ch-2 nat-2 mgt-2
Plus the 'audio guide shop' was 'sold out' within the first hour we arrived!,all-2 amn-2
It made me realize how big it really was and what a loss it's physical destruction must be to the people of Vietnam.,all-2 ch-2
"The ""cafe"" on the left after the first building with the video is a complete rip off, don't buy anything inside the Citadel.",all-2 amn-2
We sat under the pagoda and just sat in peace under the shade from the humid weather .,all-1 nat-1
Definitely one of my most favorite places in Vietnam to visit.,all-1
Not a good image.,all-2
"I personally loved the gardens whilst they are relatively new the landscaping, combination of plants and water are amazing.",all-1 nat-1
Unusual to see a fantastic tennis court at the back of the grounds.,all-1 ch-1
"I could see a ton of restoration and cleaning, the majority of the buildings is full of moss, and painting coming out.",all-3 mgt-1 ch-2
"Amazing, fantastic and memnorable, Steve and I really enjoyed the holiday - that's a good adventure to me!",all-1

If you've been to any of the forbidden cities in China then this will be a massive disappointment - being much smaller and very dilapidated.,all-2 ch-2
"Many groups of beautiful, young (mostly Japanese, it seemed) women were everywhere in Hanbok & pretty, flower-laced, hair-do's, happily taking selfies.",all-1 ch-1

I came Hue 3 months ago and everything is good - good place - people and streetfood also ...,all-1 amn-1 ppl-1
"I highly recommend taking a tour because if I hadn't taken this tour, although it's hard to believe, I would have missed out on a TON!",all-1 amn-1
"Tourists are sent to another ticket point which I find extremely annoying as 120,000 is expensive anyway!",all-2 amn-2
There are very few buildings worth visiting and you will be surprised at the amount of trash in some places.,all-2 ch-2 mgt-2
"Personally, I prefer the Gyeongbokgung Palace but maybe you need to see both to appreciate the subtle differences.",all-1
I found it really boring and tedious.,all-2
The roads emptied quickly and it was a relaxed way to get around without getting any hassle or being rushed by a guide.,all-3 amn-2 ppl-2
The city was almost completely destroyed following the Tet Offensive in 1968.,all-2 ch-2
"Like Gyeongbokgung Palace, my wife and I been to the day before, Changdeokgung Palace offers visitors many, many photography opportunities.",all-1
"A nice bunch of buildings but to be honest A LOT of it is inaccessible (you can only look from the outside), there isn't too much in between (the grounds feel sparse), and of course so little of it is original.",all-3 ch-3
"I also asked to pass High Van Pass on the way to Hue, which offers beautiful scenery.",all-1 nat-1
"The Royal garden(secret garden) of Changdeokgung is located in the center of Seoul, so it is very easy for tourists to visit there.We can see the other aspects of Seoul: calmness, peaceful, green, a lot of trees.",all-1 nat-1
Will not return and would not recommend.,all-2
"Also they do horse and carriage rides and they were using a horse that was lame and obviously in pain, which is hardly fair.",all-2 mgt-2
"It's historic and evocative, although the actual building interiors and surroundings are a bit austere and lifeless, as opposed to a more full-functioning actual monastery.",all-3 ch-3
"The palace is similar to Gyeongbokgung Palace, but on recommendation from our Korean friend, we also visited the Secret Garden.",all-0
You get such great service and you are not just with a large bus full of people being herded around and not being able to hear.,all-1 amn-1
The garden was used by the royalty to take summer leisurely strolls and it has dozens of quaint buildings hidden within nature.,all-1 ch-1 nat-1
This one is in poorer shape due to the Vietnam war destruction.,all-2 ch-2
Signs were helpful to gain insights and understanding.,all-1 mgt-1
The Citadel opens its gates from 8 in the morning & it took us around 3 hours to walk around.,all-0
"There's a cafe nearby Rods Cafe before entering the Citadel that offers free use of bathroom if purchasing food or drinks, otherwise you have to pay to use bathroom facility.",all-1 amn-1
"The entry fee was 150,000VND and to be totally honest I was underwhelmed.",all-2 amn-2
We came on a day at Chinese New Year when the gates were open to local residents free of charge.,all-1 amn-1
Be sure to bring a sun hat and plenty of water in the summer - it was incredibly hot and the drinks inside are very overpriced.,all-2 amn-2 nat-2
Really infuriating how there is a separate entrance for foreigners and one for Vietnamese with completely different prices!!,all-2 amn-2
"It now opens from 7pm, the whole place is lit up amazingly, it was a wonderful evening!",all-1
"We opted for an audio guide at a further $100k each - would really recommend that you hire an audio guide - available in 8 languages, or an actual guide!",all-1 amn-1
"NB be aware that we tried to go off the path at one point, and there was a snake in the grass, so my advice would be stick to the paths!",all-2 mgt-2
It's quite lengthy at 90 minutes and involves some trekking but the captivating serenity of this garden; and hearing anecdotes about the Korean monarchs who frequent the garden would make it worth the trouble!,all-3 nat-1 ch-1
I can only imagine this place is going to get more beautiful but it's definitely worth a visit.,all-1
There is nothing much to see and alot of stone rubble lies around everywhere.,all-2 mgt-2
The palace is huge with many buildings as well as a garden.,all-1 ch-1 nat-1
"As for the ticket, I suggest getting an ""integrated ticket"" for 10,000 won which is good for a month and which covers this palace and three other palaces namely the main palace Gyeongbokgung, Changgyeonggung (right beside here as mentioned above) & Deoksugung plus Jongmyo Shrine (also just in the vicinity of this palace); and do keep in mind that this palace along with Changgyeonggung & Deoksugung are closed on Mondays and Gyeongbokgung & Jongmyo Shrine are closed on Tuesdays.",all-1 amn-1
"Sadly as you may know , a lot of the buildings have been destroyed because of war.",all-2 ch-2

The palace lake and imperial garden are so serene and beautiful... A must-go place to visit if you're in Hue.,all-1 nat-1
Explore the scenes and prepare yourself with the right costumes as there are quite a lot of up and down walking.,all-3
"Old doesn't mean dull, but it is rich in history, and beauty..",all-1 ch-1
Some areas have been restored to their full glory while others are just in ruin and overgrown.,all-3 mgt-3 ch-3 nat-2
"Our cyclo driver was great he was also like a tour guide, his knowledge of the area was good.",all-1 amn-1 ppl-1
This place is a waste of time and money.,all-2 amn-2
Some sections were hilly but we took the opportunity to sitdown and rest after every climbs.,all-3
"Although the infrastructure of most of the buildings within the palace are not original as the original palace was destroyed during a fire, the new structures (still pretty old since it was rebuild in the 1700s to 1800s) are magnificent.",all-1 ch-1
Food is cheap and great.,all-1 amn-1
"While this is like a small copy of the Forbidden City in Beijing, what made it sad were the gaps left as a result of bombing in the war with the United States.",all-2 ch-2
It can get hot so take time out for a cool drink or ice cream at many little cafes.,all-3 amn-1 nat-2
An easy walk from the Century Riverside Hotel to The Citadel which was interesting and great to see street life as you walked down the road.,all-1

Make sure to visit the secret garden.,all-1 nat-1
They really hire people who knows how to speak different languages so that it won't be difficult for us.,all-1 amn-1

Great palace of thousand doors and windows and a Secret garden.,all-1 ch-1 nat-1
Entrance at the front and only 1 side exit open.,all-0
This place is stunning by any meaning of the word but when empty it was majestic with the only sound being the wildlife in the grass.,all-1 nat-1
This one is beautiful in many season but can be challenging for those with physical impairments due the change in elevation grades and types of pathways.,all-3
An amazing place to visit very interesting to see all the architectural aspects not just from outside the gates.,all-1 ch-1
When we got in we were very disappointed.. We walked around for about an hour before we got bored.,all-2

The Citadel was an epicentre of brutal hand to hand fighting with frequent aerial bomb raids that destroyed many of the buildings reducing them to rubble.,all-2 ch-2

"However, it was fairly expensive to get in, and pretty underwhelming inside.",all-2 amn-2
"Yes this place is definitely worth a good look just for the history attached alone, it might also be prudent to go with a guided tour or bring a good book to bring this place alive before it gets too touristy, and yes there is is the obligatory souvenir shop which is quite reasonably priced for now....!",all-1 amn-1 ch-1

"There is free tram car ride on the eastern gate straight to the museum, which was interesting.",all-1 amn-1
"First of all, the museum is not really tourist-friendly, There is no audio-guide, explanation signs are few and far between and, the most disconcerning, there are only three English tours a day with quite long waiting time in between.",all-2 amn-2 mgt-2
Unfortunately we were only able to visit here for one hour as it was part of a bus trip but I’m sure you could spend at least a full day here as it’s quite a big site.,all-3
However apparently there are also tickets for tourists and at tourist price.,all-0
"They only thing that was upsetting was seeing that a lot of the buildings had been destroyed by war (and natural disaster, but mostly war).",all-2 ch-2
The secret garden area is also a great visit and worth the extra money.,all-1 nat-1
This was an unexpectedly great experience for us.,all-1
We are very pleased with what we learn.,all-1
I wish we would have allotted more time to explore.,all-3
The Citadel and imperial city was heavily destroyed by US bombs - what is left only makes you hungry to be able to see the original size & colours.,all-3 ch-3
"Bigger than first expected and so much to see inside, spending a few hours walking around here was great as the grounds are fantastic with many different buildings to see.",all-1 ch-1
Disappointing: It is only at the exit that they tell you free shuttle cars can drive you around so ask the driver that are lazing around (not sure which colour) if they are free.,all-3 amn-3 mgt-1
She was dressed in a bright and colorful Hanbok (I think so it's easier for us to spot her) and brought around a small microphone but we still strained to hear what she was talking about.,all-2 amn-2 ppl-2

"It should also be noted that IUCN designated the secret garden as a conservation area because of its diverse ecosystem and landscape, despite being in central Seoul.",all-1 nat-1
Standing on the foundation platforms of the Forbidden Palace and looking out at the destruction--just empty grass fields remain-- is a stark reminder of the intense fighting that took place in Hue and the great loss of life in the surrounding areas.,all-2 ch-2 nat-2
Stop and watch the video to get an idea of how the citadel was built and how the emperors lived within.,all-1 amn-1 ch-1
It felt like we were seeing much of the same from what we saw prior in China and Japan.,all-2

"The tour guides did a great job of explaining the little details that you might overlook; for example, I would never have guessed that the larger doorways were only for the emperor, while the smaller doorways were for the government officials and others - using those smaller doorways required the individuals to ""bow"" as the entered.",all-1 amn-1 ppl-1 ch-1
"Worth a visit and to the secret garden, probably best with a tour guide.",all-1 nat-1 amn-1
I know you can book online but somehow it wouldn't work on my phone nor iPad.,all-2 amn-2

"Outside walking around the grounds was pretty disappointing too, almost derelict with crumbling steps, statues and overgrown grass, as this area was once a battle ground back in '68 during the Tet offensive it's no wonder the place looks kinda war weary as a large group of Vietcong held out here for two months against all the odds, before the inevitable conclusion by the Americans.",all-2 ch-2 nat-2 mgt-2
It has an extensive history dating back to the early 1800's however some of the buildings inside the complex have been destroyed by bombs.,all-3 ch-3

The cyclo was a good choice and just so easy to get around in and also inexpensive. I worked out a price for the Cyclo and Driver before setting off as I wanted him to wait for me while I visited this huge complex The Citadel.

"It has four elaborates gates – Ngo Mon (noon gate), Hoa Binh (northern gate), Hien Nhon (eastern gate) and Chuong Duc (western gate).",all-0
Bombing in 1968 destroyed many buildings and these are slow being restored.,all-2 mgt-2 ch-2
They have maintained these sites so well without altering the original set-up.,all-1 mgt-1
Direction signs for toilets and exit are very poor.,all-2 mgt-2
Some great views of the temple with the mountain backdrop.,all-1 nat-1

We spent 5 hours wandering around the inner citadel and it was beautiful!,all-1
This was such a fun place to visit.,all-1
"Tips: Please exchange your ticket for Secret Garden in advance before time start; otherwise, you may miss the tour if it's got full.",all-0
But: the place is mostly just one big construction site and ancient relicts are not being treated with the respect they deserve.,all-3 ch-2 mgt-1

On the way there a man on a cyclo tried to persuade us it was closed for lunch and luckily we didnt believe him.,all-2 ppl-2
The tickets are pricey and the funds do not seem to be going towards the restoration of this place.,all-2 amn-2 mgt-2

"after visiting the place, you will leave by the east entrance.",all-0
You can also get the boat to cross the river but you would need to walk to your hotel too.,all-1 amn-1
There is limited access to the interior of many of the buildings but just from the outside you get strong sense of some of the pageantry of Korean tradition and the buildings have been kept immaculately.,all-3 ch-1 mgt-1
Do visit the emperial hall and the museum (across the road- badly signposted!),all-3 mgt-2
The royal garden is breathtaking and you are able to buy fish food and give it to the huge Koi fish.,all-1 nat-1
The highlight of Changdeokgung Palace is the Huwon/Secret Garden.,all-1 nat-1

"Highly recommend, don’t miss it!",all-1
We took a Cyclo from our hotel and he waited 3 hours while we wandered through the many beautiful buildings and temples all surrounded by a wall and lotus filled moat.,all-1 amn-1 ch-1 nat-1 ppl-1
A shame it is not complete due to the war.,all-2 ch-2
We stopped in one of the cafes for drinks to escape the heat.,all-3 amn-1 nat-2
My expectations were very high and unfortunately our visit to the citadel couldn't fullfil these... far from actually!,all-2
"Also there no signs, but the possibility to buy a few books.",all-3 amn-1 mgt-2
The gardens are so peaceful and well preserved and our English tour guide gave a thorough history and 5-10 minutes at each stop to wander and take our own pictures.,all-1 nat-1 mgt-1 amn-1 ppl-1
Watch out for the scammers and dont pay more than 20000d for water inside the citadel.,all-2 amn-2 ppl-2

"Asked a friend who went to Gyeongbokgung palace, she says it is grander than this palace so wished I gone to that one instead.",all-2
"I understand much renovation is underway but the current site is untidy, grass over grown and a general lack of signage explaining the history if each building.",all-3 mgt-3 nat-2
So you could probably arrange your day so that you can go to the Palace and Bukchon all in one day to drink in the culture of old Korea.,all-1 ch-1
Be warned not many places for food or drink once inside.,all-2 amn-2
Many of these buildings sustained major damage during the war.,all-2 ch-2

It is easy to see why it has been designated a World Heritage Site.,all-1 ch-1
"We were so lucky that we had a tour guide with us, for our visit to Hue Imperial City Citade.",all-1 amn-1 ppl-1
So much of the place was destroyed so there wasn't much original history left.,all-2 ch-2
That was amazing and enjoyable.,all-1
The garden is green and lush although many trees are dying.,all-3 nat-3
The palace is beautiful and the throne is awesome.,all-1 ch-1
A real shame amplified by the brand new tennis court which is obviously way more important that the crumbling buildings around it!,all-2 mgt-2 ch-2
"Like all of the tourist spots in Korea, this place also lacks English signages, description of the place and decent tourist guides!",all-2 mgt-2 amn-2 ppl-2
The garden requires a separate ticket but worth the money.,all-1 nat-1
It really worth to spend a day in Hue just for this.,all-1

"We also wanted to experience the secret garden, however access to the garden is restricted to guided tours only, and the tour time table did not fit with our time schedule.",all-2 mgt-2
It’s a good way to escape the traffic noise and pollution and it has nice quiet gardens as well as old buildings with lots of information in English as well as Vietnamese.,all-1 amn-1 ch-1 nat-1
The guide's English was excellent but you still need to ensure that you keep close enough (the different rhythm and pitch of Asian speakers means you have to concentrate to understand everything).,all-3 amn-3 ppl-3
I recommend buying the integrated palace ticket as it offers great saving,all-1 amn-1
"As you meander through the gardens, mainly trees, there are pavilions & water feature areas.",all-0

"To me, the main attraction was the rear garden of the palace.",all-1 nat-1
"There are two types of entry for the citadel, with access to Pagodas and Tombs or without.",all-0
"The garden is only accessed via guided tours, which is understandable in a way, since you don't want visitors picking flowers or dabbling their feet in the pools, but it does take away some of the charm of this garden.",all-3 mgt-3
"This was a fascinating place to visit, 150,000 VND entrance was well worth it.",all-1 amn-1
It also suffered desperately in the French occupation and Vietnam/American war with most buildings destroyed.,all-2 ch-2
This would be as famous as the Forbidden City in Beijing had not the americans not had a spot of bother crossing the road at the Dong Ba Tower on the eastern wall of the walled city: they called in air strikes and you are looking at the results.,all-1 ch-1
My wife and I took a cyclo tour which gave us the opportunity to cover a lot of ground that we would not have been able to do and much less seen.,all-1 amn-1

"The Co Ha Gardens in the northwest corner is a particularly pleasant spot to spend some time - very peaceful, beautiful gardens and you can enjoy a cold drink at the cafe there.",all-1 amn-1 nat-1
There are only 2 tours a day in English and if you take them back to back you'll feel rushed - especially the palace tour becomes rushed because it leads right in to the Secret Garden tour.,all-2 amn-2
The two gates on either side of the “Emperor’s Gate” was used by his ministers and other VIPs.,all-1 ch-1
Well-maintained corridors.,all-1 mgt-1

Very glad we went here and would certainly recommend a visit.,all-1
"Still, the guides are good and speak excellent English.",all-1 amn-1 ppl-1

Feeding the fish was great fun!,all-1 amn-1
Too bad the citadel was heavily bombed causing extensive damage.,all-2 ch-2

"vi: Prices are too high, not maintained, trash scattered everywhere, where paintings are sold, etc.",all-2 amn-2 mgt-2

"A big, not impressive, full of ruins city, you can wonder around for hours, and beside of a couple nice little locations, the entire has nothing special to see.",all-3 ch-2
"Young kids loved the atmosphere, less so the exhibition on civil service documentation...!",all-1 nat-1
The parts that have not yet been restored are a truly fitting memorial to the terrible Tet Offensive battle; some 5000 troops died on each side and the walls still hold the bullet holes from the vicious fighting.,all-2 ch-2
Also enjoyed seeing all the visiting tourists in their rented Korean costume.,all-1 ch-1
Especially the Secret Garden.,all-1 nat-1
Took a half-day tour arranged through the hotel.,all-0

"Don't use it, the lady who runs it is a robber.",all-2 amn-2 ppl-2
It's just a pity that America just bomb the hell out of it.,all-2 ch-2

"This site is incredible, and at every turn there is an amazing historical building to look at, the most beautiful gardens and pretty bridges and waterways.",all-1 ch-1 nat-1
Tip for visitors - the Secret Garden is the highlight of this palace visit - remember to leave enough time to go from wandering the grounds to where the start of the tour is - takes longer and might not be as straightforward as you think!,all-1 nat-1
We visited this Palace on a free tour out of the Incheon Aiport.,all-1 amn-1
Highly recommend the secret garden tour.,all-1 amn-1 nat-1
"I'm sorry, but this was a little boring.",all-2
Overpriced water bottles etc.,all-2 amn-2
Preferred this to Gyeongbokgung actually as it was less crowded.,all-1

Definately worth visiting - we loved this visit.,all-1

Make sure you bring plenty of water and food into the complex as the prices are extortionate relative to what you could pay in Hue city.,all-2 amn-2
"When you walk into the complex, you see a large grassed and paved area inside the wall.",all-0
"It's buildings only, no furniture or anything else that would help you imagine what life would have been like.",all-2 ch-2
The palace may be hot is summer and mostly uncovered in case of rain.,all-2 nat-2 mgt-2

The buildings are absolutely beautiful and deserve a visit.,all-1 ch-1
Do not leave Seoul without visiting this Palace that is absolutely the best!,all-1

Lovely skyline divided by a historic palace wall.,all-1 ch-1 nat-1

"I hope it will be different in the coming years but at the moment some of the historical sights in Vietnam seem to exist merely for selling tickets and services to tourists, not because the past or the cultural treasures were appreciated.",all-2 ch-2
This makes it extremely difficult to learn anything about this historically important ancient Vietnamese city.,all-2
"- location: Locating in a less crowded area and with less reputation than Gyeongbokgung, Changdeokgung is comparatively quieter and more comfortable to take a look.",all-1
The Imperial city is a really interesting place to visit and we would highly recommend it as a must do when in Hue.,all-1

"I enjoyed an hour or so looking at the intricate architecture, but to the untrained eye you must remember that a lot of these palaces and buildings within them all look very similar, so unless you have a particular interest in Joseon Dynasty era palaces, then I think you should prioritise your palaces, and thus I must recommend Gyeongbokgung.",all-3 ch-3
