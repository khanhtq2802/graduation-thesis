"I noticed it when I got off the Airport Limousine Bus Stop located near it. Hurriedly left my luggage and began my visit. Learned that senior citizens can enter free, just show proof of age. Added to my visit the tour of the Secret Garden, cost was 5,000 won or about $4.

There are several buildings in the compound, all serving different purposes. Note that among the 5 palaces, only this one is a Unesco Heritage Site. Many areas to look at and take photos here.

Secret Garden Tour: can be visited on your own. No need to pay extra 5 k if you just want to see the 4 major areas. With the tour, the English speaking Guide tells about the place, reason for their construction, etc.

Caveat: There are many groups of children having their field trips here. Their noise and running around could be issues for some visitors.

Highly recommended to visit this attraction!"
Spent a good half day walking around and exploring the area. Highly recommend getting a ticket to the secret garden absolutely stunning.
"The palace was built 15th century, which is one of Seoul's 'five grand palaces'. It was. It was used as the royal residence for many kings and their families. The oldest surviving structure in the palace complex is the Okcheongyo stone bridge, built in 1483 ahead of the front gate. There is a stone turtle under the bridge. Changgyeonggung was destroyed twice and has been rebuilt. There is a secret garden too, for which additional ticket has to be purchased. Wonderful must visit place in Seoul."
"This is definitely the nicest Seoul palace. The grounds were beautifully incorporated into nature, and the buildings were plentiful and well-laid out. During our spring visit, many lilacs and azaleas were blooming, which looked and smelled very nice. The “secret” garden tour was a highlight and I would consider it a must-see (secret garden price is included in the multi-palace pass but you still need to reserve a time slot at the office; otherwise it’s a separate cost to the palace). The only downside we could find is that most of the buildings are empty or even closed up in a way that you can only really see the outside (which we found typical of all Seoul palaces). We do wish there were more displays inside buildings, but we understand that that may be hard to maintain during the seasons/outside.

We also listened to the free audio guide, and while a little corny with its characters, was much less dry than other audio tours, and gave good information on the areas and history. If you can only visit one Seoul palace, visit this one!"
"Different experience for the family. Nice architecture and gardens. We enjoyed the walk. It is cold in December, so be prepared."
"too bad it is raining when i visited this place. this palace is popular spot for taking a picture with a hanbook. its free to visit if you wear hanbook but you need to buy a ticket if you not wearing proper hanbook. my parents dont know that he need to wear special inner trouser and the security saw him, and said that it is not properly wear so he need ticket to enter this place"
"This is the prettiest of the 5 palaces in Seoul. Very impressive and well preserved/restored. We have not seen the garden which is a pity, but we liked everything else. My favorite were the servants quarters. With the beautiful autumn weather, persimmon trees with fruits, and some foliage (very late this year) - it's a stunning display."
"This is a must see historical site in Seoul. For me, seeing people wearing beautiful traditional dresses when going in and out of buildings was very interesting. The architect is obviously stunning and the history is insightful. You can easily spend few hours going in different part and then enjoy a coffee!"
This is one of the larger palaces in Seoul (there are 5 major palaces) and is certainly worth a visit. The architecture is quite amazing and the places grounds very expansive. Allow for an hour or so to tour.
The original palace was constructed in 1405 and was rebuilt again 1610 after Japanese invasion. there are different halls built for the main throne and for the queen. There is a huge palace garden at a short distance.
"Personally, I prefer Changdeokgung Palace to Gyeongbokgung or Deoksugung. This is my favorite palace in Seoul. Not too big, not too small size. Also it is connected to Changkyeong gung (another palace).

Be sure to make reservation of the Secret Garden before you visit. It is worth the time and money."
"Beautiful architectural palace of Joseon dynasty.
Secret garden, peace and perfect connection with the nature: amazing place to be visited!
You can even have a tour in english language (1h approx).
A lot of visitare are coming with typical dressing to make suggestive photos in harmony with this place and atmosphere!"
"My family and I spent close to 2 hours on a sunny autumn afternoon on an English-speaking guided tour of Changdeokgung Palace's Secret Garden.

Getting there and entrance fees:
Take Subway Line 3 to Anguk Station (328). Upon coming out of exit 3, walk straight along Yulgok-ro for about 400 metres and you will reach the ticketing office of Changdeokgung Palace in about 5 to 10 minutes. The Palace is open every day from 10am except on Monday and closes at 4:30pm or 5pm or 6pm depending on the season.

Unlike the main Palace grounds, the Secret Garden is restricted in human traffic and hence you could only access it through guided tours (usually about 90 minutes). Even though we bought Secret Garden tour tickets, we also had to purchase general admission tickets because the Secret Garden is inside the Palace grounds. So general admission ticket price is: ₩3,000 (adult), ₩1,500 (youth, age 7 to 18) while the Secret Garden guided tour ticket price is: ₩5,000 (adult), ₩2,500 (youth).

Every day, there are many guided tours conducted in mainly Korean and only a few in English. The English guided tours are at 10:30am, 11:30am, 2:30pm and 3:30pm (February to November) and 10:30am, 11:30am and 2:30pm (December to January). Also for every guided tour, there are only 100 tickets available, of which 50 tickets are for online booking 6 days in advance until one day before tour date and the remaining 50 for “walk-in” (first come first serve). My family and I booked our tickets online as we anticipated popularity of the tour in autumn.

The attraction:
After being burnt to the ground during the Japanese invasions (Imjin War) in the late 16th century, Changdeokgung Palace was fully rebuilt by 1609. It then became the main seat of the Joseon Dynasty - Korea’s most celebrated empire. Hence such historical authenticity led to its awarding in 1997 as a UNESCO World Heritage Site, and is the only South Korea royal palace to be accorded. Changdeokgung Palace’s garden behind the inner hall, called the Secret Garden or Huwon, was constructed during the reign of King Taejong (1401 – 1418). It served as an area for the royal family members to relax and to enjoy various activities from fishing, archery, planting and sericulture (rearing of silkworms). At 78 acres or 316 thousand square meters, the Secret Garden occupies about 60% of the Palace grounds.

We met our English-speaking guide at the entrance to the Secret Garden. He was very knowledgeable in the history and used a tablet for explanation and showing pictures. The 90 minutes route of the guided tour started at assembling at Hamyangmun Gate and took us to the following attractions in the Secret Garden:
(1) Buyongji Pond - a rectangular pond with the still pond water reflecting the 3 pavilions: Buyongjeong, Yeonghwadang and Juhamnu.
(2) Juhamnu Pavilion – this is the largest pavilion that was built around Buyongji Pond. Constructed in 1776 during the first year of King Jeongjo’s reign, it served as a library and has two floors: the ground floor is the book repository and the second floor is the reading room.
(3) Uiduhap Pavilion - built by Crown Prince Hyomyeong as a place of study, reading, and reflection
(4) Bullomun Gate – ""gate of eternal youth"" as inscribed by 3 Chinese characters; walking through this stone gate to Aeryeonji Pond was supposed to bring blessings of good health and long life
(5) Aeryeonji (“love of lotus”) Pond - pond with Aeryeonjeong Pavilion that was constructed in 1692 during the reign of King Sukjong
(6) Yeongyeongdang Complex – this area stood out for its different architecture that conveyed informality. Crown Prince Hyomyeong constructed around 1826 the Yeongyeongdang Hall for Jinjakrye - a special “title” ceremony for his father King Sunjong - and for celebrating the 40th birthday of his mother. This was also a residential area where men and women living quarters were separated. Since the reign of King Gojong, Yeongyeongdang complex was used to receive foreign envoys, particularly at the Seonhyangjae Hall.
(7) Jondeokjeong Area – it is believed that this was the last area to be built in the Secret Garden. It comprised Gwallamji Pond with beautiful pavilions, particularly the special hexagonal, two-layered roof Jondeokjeong Pavilion in which two dragons play with Cintamani (symbol of royal authority) on the roof ceiling and the fan shaped Gwamlamjeon Pavillion; both pavilions are located at the edge of the pond.
(8) Ongnyucheon Stream area – Ongnyucheon is the name of the brook or stream that flows though the Gardens. On the way to Ongnyucheon is the Chwigyujeong Pavillion which was built for the King to rest on his walk to this area. There is a flat rock, Soyoam, where the King carved a poem on the rock and a u-shaped stream where a poetry game using floating wine cups was played during parties. There are also 5 lovely pavillions (Cheonguijeong, Chwihanjeong, Nongsanjeong, Soyojeong and Taegeukjeong) of which the only thatch-roof Cheonguijeong Pavillion clearly stands out.In winter, the Ongnyucheon Stream Area is not part of the tour
(9) Back or behind of Yeongyeongdang Complex and outside of Gwolnaegaksa (Government Office Complex)
(10) Donhwamun Gate (main gate of Changdeokgung Palace)

In the one and half hour, my family and I enjoyed the following:
(1) Peaceful, tranquil and serene ambiance throughout the Secret Garden which refreshed our souls from the hustle and bustle of city life
(2) Beautiful autumn foliage of brilliant yellow, red, purple and orange throughout the Secret Gardens that accentuated Mother Nature’s beauty of the Secret Garden even more. I liked the autumn foliage most at the Gwallamji Pond.
(3) Seeing the actual Buyongji Pond and Juhamnu Pavillion as opposed to seeing these on promotional pictures
(4) Appreciating the natural setting of the Secret Gardens that harmonise with Mother Nature and keeping man-made landscapes to a minimum
(5) The Secret Garden is so well preserved and well-maintained
(6) Strolling and learning the history from a knowledgeable guide – it was like going back to the past

During and after the visit, we could appreciate why Koreans rated so highly the Secret Garden. It is remarkably a beautiful place to take a stroll in every season, not just autumn. So this is a “must visit” on anyone’s itinerary when you are in Seoul. After all, Changdeokgung Palace and the Secret Garden was listed in the “Top 100 Must-Visit Tourist Spots in Korea for 2021-2022”. Also, several Korean television dramas were shot at the Secret Gardens including The Red Sleeve and Love in the Moonlight. As there is plenty of walking and climbing of steps in certain paths, do wear a comfortable pair of waling shoes and bring drinking water as there is no restaurant or food stores inside the Secret Garden."
"No crowds. Less renovated than the G Palace. Built afterwards
Grounds are well maintained with trees. Very inexpensive. Go early and beat the heat"
"I really loved the feel of this palace, like a haven of peace in the heart of the busy city. It is really beautiful. Because of Covid there was no guided tour or audio guide available but it is still worth the trip.
The only negative thing is I had to get a second ticket to visit the secret garden. It is a a bit a shame that you can’t buy a combo ticket
It took me actually a few visit to be able to do the secret garden as the number of tickets sold
In a day is limited and I couldn’t book in advance"
"A very interesting place to visit, inexpensive but you need to pay extra for the Secret Garden. If you are in a budget, skip the palace and for the Secret Garden"
Great walk through history. The palace has been restored to allow the visitor to immerse yourself in the experience of how they lived and the spectacular size of the property with an overtaking number of rooms to see
"There are two parts to this palace and they are ticketed separately.

The first part is the palace buildings. These are well preserved and have nice colours on the outside, especially the ceilings. But it was a once-and- done for us even though we love history, because:
1) there wasn’t any information in English at the buildings themselves or pamphlets available, so we had to make do with the very basic pamphlet at the entrance, which fortunately has a map. There might be audio guides or guided tours; we did not look into that nor did we see anyone else using them.
2) We visited in June, and It was scorchingly hot. There aren’t many places to sit and not much shelter as you travel between buildings. Shaded sections that were used by the royals are closed to the hoi polloi.
3) You aren’t allowed to enter any of the buildings either; you stand in the sun and peer into some of the cool interiors wishing you could get done respite from the sun, but no.
4) There’s next to no furniture in the few rooms you can look into.
5) Most of the buildings are closed up so nosey tourists can’t see through the windows or doors.
6) If you have been to the Forbidden City in Beijing, this is kind of a smaller, less grand version.
6) The souvenir shop is tiny and there’s not much there. But at least there’s air conditioning.

The secret garden is the second part of the experience. It’s a nice, large garden with forested areas. Again, we would not return to visit the Secret Garden for the following reasons:

1) The term “secret” is really used euphemistically here. Entry is only via a tour with at least a 100 people in it. You won’t feel it’s secret… in fact it will feel crowded, and you are herdaed around like sheep. There will be running kids and annoying women taking selfies; they will walk into your photographs. It will be a challenge to take any photographs that convey a sense of secrecy.
2) If you try to linger, there’s a stern woman in uniform at the back who will tell you to hurry up in Korean. If you don’t understand Korean, it’s ok; she will make sure you understand.
3) The guide blasts information through a loudspeaker. You will certainly hear her over the sound of rushing streams and lotus swaying in the breeze. But you may not understand much. The loudspeaker distorts her voice, and if you had our guide, you will struggle to understand her English."
"The Palace(s) are amazing, well worth it! To be clear, you have to buy two tickets: one for the Palace and it's grounds and another for the Secret Garden.
Definitely the Palace tour is well worth it and a must-do in Seoul.
But...
The Secret Garden - what a disappointment. Short version: If you hate being crammed into a large and rushed group: this event might not be for you and you can save yourself some money (it’s an additional ticket).
Don’t get me wrong: the GARDEN is magnificent, the old temples/buildings are WONDERFUL, the park is awesome… but you are forced into a guided-tour schedule.
Naively I expected 20 people or so (the Sunday day was sold out, so back on Tuesday for a timed-ticket). Well: turns out they cram 100-150 people into one tour. The tour-guide uses a loud-speaker/microphone set up to communicate with that large crowd. There is a security guard with a walkie-talkie(!) following the group to ensure that the cattle-group doesn’t loose a cow(person). Moooo! What is going on?
The garden is HUGE! The tour takes 1.5h… it would be wonderful to experience the quietness and splendor. And here we are rushed in a tightly packed group from one spot to another. After 1/2 the tour, kids and older visitors lose interest and talk ... which makes it hard to understand the loud-speaker-tour-guide. This was a frustrating and unworthy experience.
The Secret Garden and pagodas/temples are magnificent but please allow self-guiding or offer smaller private tours! This was undignified."
"Changdeokgung Palace was built as the secondary palace for Joseon dynasty some 10 years after the first palace of Gyeonbokgung, in early 15 c.
The main difference between two of them is that the first palace of Gyeonbokgung was built to strict geometric orders with all palaces in line, while Changdeokgung palace complex was scattered around following the topography layout. The highlight of that design was the garden complex behind the palace complex intended for relaxation, called the Secret garden. That part takes more than a half of the entire Palace complex.
Probably that was the reason Joseon Kings liked Changdeokgung more than their first palace and therefore they renovated and rebuilt it right after the Japanese 1592 invasion, while Gyeongbokgung remained devastated and destroyed for centuries.
Moreover, Changdeokgung served as the main Palace and King seat from early 17c for almost 300 years.
That's why it is on UNESCO list while Gyeongbokgung is not.

Likewise all Seoul palaces entry is ridiculously cheap, specially if you purchase the Royal Palace Pass which includes all 5 palaces for a below 8$ fee.
There are 2 or 3 guided English tours daily (ours was at 1.15 PM), check on the palace website.
The Royal Pass also includes the Secret garden but you have to exchange your booklet Pass voucher for the real ticket at the ticket booth, and to schedule a guided tour as this is the only way to visit the gardens (our garden tour was at 2.30 PM, just after the Palace tour finished, so it was a great schedule).

While the Palace tour was excellent, I was disappointed with the Secret garden.
It's a similar kind of garden you see in Japan, China, even elsewhere in Europe or US.
Besides, even the tour guide told us the gardens are average in spring, and best in Oct, November with autumn colors leaves.
So, if you're tight with time you can skip the Garden tour, as the entire experience (Palace + Gardens) takes you almost 4 hours."
"Changdeokgung Palace is the palace of Joseon dyhasty which is the most historically valuable palace of the Joseon Dynasty among palaces of Joseon. The reason is that, unlike Gyeongbokgung Palace, which is the most well-known among the palaces of Joseon, it was Changdeokgung Palace that played the role of the actual palace during the about 500-year period of the Joseon Dynasty. Also, Changdeokgung Palace is the most well-preserved palace among the five major Palaces in Seoul. What’s more, Changdeokgung Palace is the only one listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site among the five major palaces in Seoul. Visiting Changdeokgung Palace, you can feel the serenity in the middle of Korea's noisiest city. Espicically, I strongly recommend to walk around the secret garden of Changdeokgung palace. Because there is one of the most beautiful gardens in Korea where you can feel the essence of Korean beauty. It’s well worth a visit when you travel to Seoul."
"My favourite of the Seoul palaces! So many beautiful structures and the secret garden was fabulous. Definitely be prepared for some big hills if you do the secret garden tour though, and wear your walking shoes! We didn’t realise how big of a walk it would be!"
"A must see . Secret garden is a must , you have to pay for the guided tour , very informative . Be aware it’s huge and very hilly in parts .
Lots of photo ops . Tour takes around 90 mins"
"The architecture is spectacular. Almost everything is a photo spot. There’s also a changing of guards routine,"
"peaceful place in the heart of the busy city.We got an English tour guide and did a tour of the Secret Garden. The garden incorporates a lotus pond, pavilions, and landscaped lawns, trees, and flowers. here in February not a lot in bloom and it'd be stunning I'm sure to go during the spring or summer when the Lotus Ponds and the flowers are in season. The Garden takes up almost 60% of the entire area of the Palace. We were told in the old days tigers would occasionally appear within the Garden walls! :)"
This was the largest and most beautiful of the five palaces in Seoul. Each has their own feel to them but the sheer extensiveness of this one was impressive. The palace is not furnished
"My partner and I came here and the entry into the Palace is cheap and easy to purchase from the nearby ticket office. The palace and surrounding buildings are beautiful and make for some lovely photos. I’d recommend picking up a copy of the map from the ticket office beforehand as this really helped us navigate where we were. The second part of this area offers an extra ticket (5,000 WON) to enter the secret garden, which is done on time slots. We selected the 11:30am English tour. The secret garden is well worth doing as this is really picturesque and peaceful, and it is interesting learning about what the gardens were and the buildings in the area. It was beautiful in the snow and this turned out to be, in our opinion, the best part of the visit."
"This is one among five major palaces in Seoul and the only one with UNESCO recognition. In contrast to the more popular but largely ""new"" Gyeongbokgung, Changdeokgung offers a relatively real experience about the Joseon dynasty. The part close to the main entrance is recently renovated; go all the way to the end and Nakseonjae, an unpretentious compound gives visitors an unpolished face of the royal residence. Well worth the 3000 won admission to explore this lovely heritage."
"If you can only visit one palace, visit this one, it is a UNESCO world heritage site as most of the other palaces including Gyeongbokgung was recently rebuilt and not original, they offer free tours a couple times a day once you have bought a ticket, it is also worth visiting the secret garden if you have time however this is at extra cost."
Amazing place ! Such a beautiful piece of history right in the city centre of Seoul. And the snow made it extra special. ☃️🇰🇷
"Although some buildings inside (and in other palaces as well) have been rebuilt , you can still feel history inside. I prefer visiting these palaces when there are fewer people, though."
"I prefer this palace than Gyeongbokgung. A must visit palace, not to miss the secret garden, views during autumn is wonderful."
"This is one of my favorite places in Seoul. I’ve always liked the tranquility of temples, palaces, and gardens in South Korea, and Changdeokgung Palace is one of the most memorable of them. The ponds are beautiful, the buildings fit in with the nature around them, and you can tell there was a lot of thought put into the design of the palace – it’s steeped in history and feels that way.

Tips: There is an entrance fee (which can be paid with Tmoney, when I went it was 3,000 won) which lets you see a portion of the palace grounds. I paid when I got to the palace front gates.
To see the gardens, about 60% of the palace, you need to buy an additional ticket, a guided tour ticket (5,000 won). The only way to access the gardens is through a guided tour, but you get plenty of free time to explore and take pictures during the tour! You can buy tickets online or at the front gate.

My favorite spot was the meditation area!"
"The palace is not as big as Gyeongbukgung but more beautiful and well connected between the chambers. However, an additional ticket cost KRW5,000/pp is required to enter the Secret Garden, and staff cannot speak English."
A highlight is Seoul! Wear a hanbok and get in free. Delight in many areas. You step back into history! Don’t miss if you visit!
"Actually the area of the palace is very big, you can spend quite a lot of time inside. There is a big garden area behind with very nice environment setup. However, visitors cannot see the rooms inside and I believed the rooms are empty, after the trip I still have no idea how the royal family lived and what they've used. The only place the visitor can participate is kitchen part, people can join some kind of tea time.
There is another museum next to the palace, it shows the history of Korean kingdom, I think that one is more interesting."
"This is probably my favourite palace, besides Anapji (Wolji Pond in Gyeongju UNESCO site an hour outside Busan). It isn’t the largest of the two main Royal palaces used in the Joseon era, but certainly has a more inviting feel than the popular Gyeongbokgung palace, where changing of the guard draws an audience every day (10:00, 2:00). The beloved of Joseon dynastic kings until the murder of Queen Myeongseong by Japan and Joseon invasions (1392-1910), Changdeokgung had a Secret Garden (generally before 2 pm but closed Mon-Tuesdays), created in 1405 for the Queen dowager. This was beside her residence at Daejojeon hall and son’s Prince Study, where archers or wild tigers appeared. The Secret Garden tour ticket office is beside a later add-on, Nakseonjae for King Heonjong’s mistress, in the days when marriages were arranged by elders. It is also cheaper here for private boutique hanbok dress rentals—a third or quarter of the price than elsewhere. Admission is $2 for anyone up to age 24, and $5 (or double for a Royal Pass to 5 palaces sites). This area was important leading up to the 1964 April 19 Revolution, Proclamation of Korean Government (1948 constitution and election), and anticolonial resistance against imperial Japan until 1945. For local considerations,
Hanok Homestay Yeonwoo House (5-13 Bukchon-ro 12-gil) is just above Bukchon-ro 56 Pear cafe, facing Hanbok Rental for $2-5, children’s sizes included. Not to be missed, visit the palace by 4 pm (generally latest 4:30-5:30 pm entry, Sept-May but closed Mondays and holidays)."
"On an extensive website the only indication that the palace is closed on Mondays is a tiny footnote (see picture).
There is no star in the text to indicate what this footnote refers to.
I would expect better from one of Seoul’s major tourist attractions."
"An intersting place to visit. It consists mainly of scenically laid out, empty buildings. If you do not know the history it will probably seem underwhelming. I suggest doing reseach beforehand or joining one of the tours. Free entry if you are wearing a hanbok. These can be hired for two or four hours from local stores. Good bus service. There are toilets and a cafe that only seems to sell drinks. There is a larger cafe outside the palace. There is a small gift shop. Tickets need to be purchased from the ticket office on the left hand side or from the ticket booths directly outside.
The palace has a secret garden, which you have to pay extra to visit. It is accessible by guided tour only and these are done in different languages, so make sure you book the right one. The tour is informative and lasts 70-90 minutes dependent on weather. The tickets sell out quickly so it is worth pre=booking on-line. The gardens were stunning and well worth a visit.
Staff were all helpful. Everthing was very clean, including the toilets."
"The architecture and roof lines and painting and tress - all beautiful. And the concrete ""gargoyles"" are varied animals and the preservation of everything is amazing. Admission to the palace is free for seniors.
My only regret would be that I simply didn't have enough time. And was unable to go to the Secret Garden because it is only available if you sign up for a guided tour. English (my language) was not offered for hours after I had already spent the good part of a day at the palace.
I'd recommend finding out about the tour times for the Secret Garden prior to going."
"As foreigner , I am sure you will be charmed . There will be a show and dance .. shows how the soldiers change shifts , the outfits are amazing ."
"An interesting historical and cultural site in a scenic park like setting. Beautiful. I highly recommend the Secret Garden tour, which requires a separate ticket and 90-minute walking tour. The walk was longer and more strenuous than I had expected but worth the time and effort. Would go again."
"This was our sentiment when we visited this palace ? It is similar to the other palaces in Seoul and the forbidden city in Beijing or the palace in Avignon, France
. It is all an Empty shell with no entrance allowed into any of the inner ss run of the buildings . With very little information provided , the buildings become meaningless attraction sites

Not worth your time to visit ."
"Stunning palace. I have a lot of time in Seoul and Korea so going to see all the palaces. If your time is limited, definitely do this one. Time your visit accordingly with the mandatory guided tour of the Secret Garden. Annoyingly they appear to change timings so check online the day before your visit. I got there at 09:00 when they opened. I was the first person inside. I walked around the palace grounds myself for just over an hour and then did the English guided Secret Garden tour at 10:30 which finished around noon. Lasts about one and a half hours. You can leave the tour after fifty minutes as the last part is quite a bit of walking including uphill. For most of us it is fine but others were struggling with the heat even though it was early and parts of it are uphill so be mindful. I spent in total three hours there. Separate ticket for the palace and Secret Garden. They do have guided tours of the palace itself but to be honest, you can easily do this yourself. They give you a booklet plus there are information boards. Suggest going early as soon as it opens. It was beautiful and peaceful and you could freely walk around and enjoy the setting, also getting some good photographs. When I left at noon, it was much busier. Grounds are clean and well laid out. The palace was stunning. I loved the details of the doors and the architecture. There is a cafe and what appeared to be an art or souvenir shop on the premises. I didn't bother with it. Take water with especially if you are there for three hours like me. There are restrooms too. My thoughts. The Secret Garden is apparently the highlight. Whilst this was nice, I think the weather will contribute towards your experience. We had a lovely day and the sun shining with the reflection on the water and the colours of the leaves made the gardens look very pretty. However, we can't control the weather and I would suggest thinking about this if you have a day with bad weather. Parts of the garden were nice but other parts started to look the same. I started to get bored as did a lot of the group. I was glad I went though. The guide was difficult to understand (although the tour was in English) but there are information boards as well along the route which also provide useful facts. They limit the number of people on the tour so purchase a ticket as soon as you arrive."
"In this park is a large collection of, mostly repaired and rebuild ancient historical buildings, excellent to learn about Korea's history, Very much worth the visit!"
A beautiful palace and nice grounds. Sadly we didn’t get to do the secret garden. We will next time! Highly recommended.
"It was awesome to see the palace, and take a step back in time. There were ceremonies going on while I was there, so we got to see some exquisite historical fashions. It was also the anniversary of the ferry tragedy, so I got to speak with some of the families that lost their loved ones. Very heartbreaking story about the government's lack of responsibility, and backhanded transactions resulting in the deaths of so many young kids and workers. I'll never forget this visit."
"Again, this palace is not genuine, it has been rebuilt back in 1600, but it’s well-conserved and enjoyable, with its relaxing gardens!"
"This is an absolute Seoul MUST! The views back into downtown are surreal. The palace complex is simply fascinating. Somehow, even as a visitor, I found myself fantasizing that I was the emperor… it looks like good work if you can get it… otherwise, it’s not so good."
"I definitely enjoyed this palace the most of all the palaces in Seoul. What makes this one unique... the Secret Garden.

Although this was the secondary palace of Gyeongbokung it’s landscaping along with with its design make it stand out above the rest.

Small fee to get inside, additional fee for secret garden. No tours currently because of COVID-19. Definitely recommend you get the Royal Palace Pass for 10,000₩. The pass grants admission to 4 palaces and a shrine."
"I really loved the feel of this palace, like a haven of peace in the heart of the busy city. It is really beautiful. Because of Covid there was no guided tour or audio guide available but it is still worth the trip.
The only negative thing is I had to get a second ticket to visit the secret garden. It is a a bit a shame that you can’t buy a combo ticket"
"C ( 20.12.09 )
This palace was one of beautiful palace in Seoul. This palace was very beautiful and could feel about Choseon royal family's atmosphere. There had many beautiful architecture of Choseon that was Korea's dynasty. I didn't understand why Chandeokgung and Changyeonggung's entrance fee paid separately, but it was certain that there was very beautiful."
"I took my friend here when they came to visit Korea. And as a local, I would say this is a must-see place for all travelers who come to Seoul, where you can have the experience of wearing traditional attire and walk around the palace like a prince or prince in the old times."
They certainly knew how to live in the olden days. Well if you were a nobleman that is. Love the architecture.
"This palace was visually stunning. The Huwon tour (Secret Garden) was awesome. I visited in December, and there was an otherworldly quality walking through the garden with ice on the ponds and a chill in the air. I can't wait do take this tour again in the spring or summer."
"I think this palace is so gorgeous and beautiful palace.
Of course, the significance is somewhat worse than Gyeongbokgung (in my opinion) but the gorgeousness was better.
The experiences were so great!"
"My sister had previously traveled to Seoul and she told me that to her, the Changdeokgung palace was the most impressive one of all palaces in Seoul. Yes, I agree. It is second in size after its neighbor the Gyenongbokgung palace, the main palace. It is a secondary palace that was used as the main palace at times of disaster or war. As mentioned before, the main palace was Gyenongbokgung.

Changdeokgung is also a fully restored palace. The palace was destroyed by the Japanese at the beginning of the XX century during the occupation of Korea. Japan wanted to get rid of any vestige of Korean culture. The palace is very well restored. The main hall is monumental. The palace buildings are lovely and have a more disorganized distribution when compared with the order of the Gyenongbokgung palace. The lack of order makes it charming; in some areas you will feel that you are walking through a labyrinth that surprises you at every corner. The colors of the walls and roof are phenomenal! One of the buildings preserves its original blue color roof; it is a very dark, shiny blue that is unique of Korea! There are many places where you can take pictures and relax under the shade.

You need approximately 2 hours to visit the palace. Once you finish, go to the secret gardens. The secret gardens belong to this palace; however, the entrance is separate and you need a different ticket. I recommend to buy the ticket that covers the 4 palaces of the Joseon dinasty, the garden, and the Jongmyo santuary. It is very cheap!

The place is very well labeled. I do not recommend tours to visit this place. You need to have time to enjoy it. You need freedom to enjoy it.

Visit the palace in a sunny day. Colors are spectacular; most of the visit is outdoors."
I was reluctant first to visit but we give it a try since we came from the Bukchon Hanok Village and I didn't regret visiting the Palace. This gave us the South Korean locale feels. I think the place was so huge that we didn't get the chance to walk around as it's our last day before the midnight flight. I highly recommend visiting this Palace before leaving SK!
"My son, husband and I decided to visit the Changdeokgung Palace during our visit to Seoul. There are other Palaces in Seoul but we decided to go see this one since it is the only one that is considered a Unesco Heritage site and it's also within walking distance to the Hangbok Cultural Village which is another neat thing to do.

We got an English tour guide and did a tour of the Secret Garden. it being February not a lot was in bloom and it'd be stunning I'm sure to go during the spring or summer when the Lotus Ponds and the flowers are in season. The Garden takes up almost 60% of the entire area of the Palace. We were told in the old days tigers would occasionally appear within the Garden walls! :) The garden incorporates a lotus pond, pavilions, and landscaped lawns, trees, and flowers. There are over 26,000 specimens of a hundred different species of trees in the garden and some of the trees behind the palace are over 300 years old.

The Palace was constructed in 1405, destroyed in the late 1500's by the Japanese and then rebuilt in 1610 and served as the Main palace for about 270 years. You can feel the history around you as you stroll.

Admission is 3000 Korean Won which equals $3.30 Canadian and also includes tickets to the Gyeongbokgung Palace, the Deoksugung Palace, the Changgyeonggung Palace and the Jongmyo Shrine. The tickets don't expire until 3 months after purchase so if you have time to go see them all it's an amazing deal. (It's an amazing deal just to get in to one!!!) :)

A must see if in Seoul."
"If you have little to no knowledge of Korean history (like me), I'd suggest you to take the guided tour. The guide was friendly, knowledgeable and very accommodating.

Book your ticket to Secret Garden online and you can book 7 days earlier prior to your visit. I took the last tour of the day and there were less people in the evening."
"If you are going to do one palace, this is the one to do! It is the prettiest out of the 5 palaces in Seoul. They have the secret garden in the back that you can take with a guided tour."
"Set within a large park, accessible by subway, bus or tour,
this Prospering Virtue Palace was built during the Joseon Dynasty.
It served as the main palace for nearly 270 years following its destruction during the Japanese invasion and its subsequent rebuilding.
A visitor may note that one building in particular, the Seonjeongjeon Hall is the only building featuring a tiled blue roof.
There indeed is a love story to the history of this exquisite and beautiful palace, yet I shall leave that for the visitor to enjoy on their visit.

One detail in particular that distinguishes this palace from other palaces of the Joseon Dynasty is the palace gardens, and I am already planning my return trip to behold the “Quintessence of Joseon-era Landscaping” in spring or summer, to step where Kings and Queens strolled, relaxed, and perhaps engaged in sericulture.
To truly savor visiting the Changdeokgung Palace I need to walk its gardens, valleys, pavilions and behold the lotus ponds and then see the Palace from otherwise hidden views.
The Secret Garden occupies more than half of the entirety of Changdeokgung Palace, and I am delighted to plan my return to see the views from the Buyongji Pond and Juhamnu Pavilion, Aeryeonji Pond and Uiduhap, the New Seonwonjeon (New Royal Shrine) and so much more.

In the meantime I hope you enjoy my photographs of Changdeokgung Palace.

Please note that the admission to the Changdeokgung Palace is separate from the admission to the Secret Garden and, at least as of this writing, there is (but verify this) a Royal Palace Pass valid for 3 months from the purchase date, which includes admission to the Changdeokgung Palace and the Secret Garden;
the Gyeongbokgung Palace;
the Changgyeonggung Palace;
the Deoksugung Palace; and
the Jongmyo Shrine."
"It is not original building, it was destroyed and rebuilt. Actually, it is not one but series of buildings. I recommend going there with a guide."
There is a tour guide with an option of English / Mandarin speaking to tour the whole palace with details of the historical story when you purchase entrance tickets from the counter. It is a beautiful and nice palace that have chances for photo shooting. It's worthwhile to visit.
"From Anguk subway station, head east from Exit 3, and you will find the entrance to the palace. Admission was reasonable at 3,000 won. You get to see the Throne Hall, with the impressive king's chair. Other than that, a lot was under repair, and you don't get to access the King's residence building, so not much to see. We didn't know how or if you could access the Queen's residence building (behind the King's residence building)... so overall, we didn't get to see much; however, the ones we saw were well preserved."
Wonderful and memorable experience though the Palace is smaller than Gyeongbokgung it is still a special place. There are a few hidden spots to photograph.
"It was free for the Christmas for all palaces .

Changdeokgung has more intricate buildings than the larger palace in Seoul, despite the smaller sizes.

Definitely worth a visit while in Seoul."
Taking the time to feel a little of the Korean history by visiting garden and temples within the Changdeokgung Palace. Changing time (and world) within a day!
"I have been here several times, but each time I discover yet another photo yet to be taken and just love this place."
"fantastic palace, spent a few hours there. Went into the museum which was really interesting. The changing of the guards was a sight to see very colourful and fascinating to watch. Definitely worth a visit."
"In this Palace, you definitely will learn the history about the past and last Royal Family's sad story."
"very good place to visit and learn history. I have been there twice, second time is for the secret gardon, different season has different view in this gardon, it's worth go there many times."
"I went there during winter, thus the scenery wasn't as great as autumn. Yet, i couldn't help to feel the beauty of the place. It was well preserved and taken care of. Entrance fee is 3000₩, and there's tour available. The Secret Garden is a must."
It’s a nice Palace but having been to a few now in Korea it’s a little tiring. If this is your first Palace then this is a great start but you’ll soon see that all palaces in Korea have the exact same layout and every building has the exact same designs and colours.
"Historically palace, if you wearing hanbok , you get to enter for free because Koreans care much about their traditions. Very impressed."
"The buildings are lovely here, but for me the main reason to visit is the secret garden. It is wonderful! You enter the garden with a group according to language, but to be honest I ditched them as soon as I was inside as I wanted to do my own thing and some peace and quiet. I was lucky enough to visit during autumn and it didn't disappoint...it was full of beautiful colours. You will need a couple of hours to do the place justice and be prepared to walk up and down and then down and up...totally worth it though.

If you arrive in hanbok (Korean traditional dress) you get for free!"
A huge place of Korea history in this place. Worth visiting. U can see lots of people wearing Hanbok costumes and taking photos here.
"Visited Changdeokgung palace. Changdeokgung Palace is also known as Donggwol, the Eastern Palace, because of its location to the east of Gyeongbokgung Palace.

Was amazed and thrilled of how the Joseon Dynasty was ruled. They preserve the architecture of the building pretty well. Took some awesome pictures of Injeongjeon & Daejajeon. Love the story behind how the king ruled his ministry and kingdom."
This ancient palace is worth a visit and also to capture the beauty of the Korean rich palaces and culture of ancient days. Best to get there before their daily changing of the guards at the palace entrance.
"We chose this palace to visit its biwon/secret garden. There was a discount if you bought combined entrance tickets and joined english speaking guide tour. After finished visiting a mesmerizing garden, we walked to gyeongbokgung palace to watch royal guard changing ceremony at 2p.m. for you to be able to do this, it is advisable for you to join changdeokgung palace tour at 9.30 a.m and subsequently secret garden tour at 11 a.m. the tour will be finished around 12.30 and you have ample time to return your rented hanbok."
"It is an older palace compared to the rebuilt Gyeongbukgong. The highlight of this palace to me is the Secret Garden at the back of this palace. There is a separate entrance fee to the garden. Entrance is strictly by guided tours only. It is limited to 100 visitors per guided tour. The English tour is at 2.30pm daily, and the garden is closed on Wednesdays. My visit to this palace was on a Wednesday but was not told the Secret Garden is closed. I went back on Thursday again to visit the Secret Garden, and had to pay for another palace entrance fee as the garden is only accessible from inside the palace. Lol"
"Great place to visit for the historical feel and exploration. Colours in the winter are generally dull, but was a good cultural heritage site."
"This is a great place to visit that is rich in history. There is a small cost but well worth it. If you are over 65 yrs old it is free. If you didn't book with a guide, just find one and walk close with them. The building are amazing, it is an easy walk. You feel like you are out in the country instead of in the middle of the city."
Amazing piece of history of Korea in the heart of Seoul city. Take your walking shoes and stroll across time whilst observing people dressed in traditional clothing taking their pictures.
"Visited the palace first before Gyeongbokgung. Read reviews that this palace was designed to be in harmony with the environment and after arriving there, it can be observed as to how it is. For a Palace, it is certainly not imposing as the Gyeongbokgung one and certainly no surprise why many princes chose to have their palace here. Unfortunately, I did not follow any guided tour for the front part if the palace, thus may have missed much interesting snippets.

However the guided tour to the ""Secret Garden"" is a must. Only entered with a guided tour, they are conducted at different times for different languages. I say it's a must so when you visit, u can imagine how the palace designers have made much effort to be a environmentally harmonious building. Do make a point to visit it."
"There are three other palaces in Seoul alone; this one has buildings that are as original as wooden buildings can ever be after several hundred years, whereas most - not all - wooden palace and temple buildings in Korea are essentailly reconstructions or rebuilds from pieces. This is a massive park site, and you have to look up the times of tours for the hidden gardens (in your language) as you can't just wander round them."
A pleasant surprise. This is a 600 year old heritage site. Awesome beautiful place to visit. Loved the stroll around the palace.
"The palace covers a large area. So be prepared to walk in comfy footwear. There are many sections of the palace to explore and a conservatory / green house and a lake. Need at least a day to cover most grounds which we ran out of time as we were busy taking photos at every turn (almost!).

There is a map of the palace located in various section so you know where you are going. In total about 15 sections.

The autumn scape is of vibrant and fiery red as the maple trees / leaves change for the season. Very colourful and scenic. Worth a visit.

You can also hire the traditional attire - Hanbok from nearby shop. We bought rented our Hanbok via an app for 4-hour and it only cost us US$15 each, and also get free admission in to the palace.

If you are in Seoul for a few days try this experience!"
"An early 09.00 start made it easy to buy the $3 ticket, which was for the Palace complex beyond the courtyard. Free activities included the Royal Palace Museum and 10.00 changing of the guard parade. Information booths and free pamphlets in multiple languages are available for free and were indispensable. The palace buildings are on a grand scale and beautiful despite being rebuilt after many historical setbacks and unfortunate damage. It doesn't detract from the majesty of the culture and location. The museum is informative and well stocked with interesting artefacts. Gift shops and WC facilities are available everywhere (Carry emergency paper!). The parade was a very entertaining spectacle with accompanying music, drill and PA narration. A pagoda in the distance identifies the Folk Museum Park at the rear. Modern architecture and electronic advertising screens on a large scale are juxtaposed against the ancient/traditional palace environs. On the outside corner of the palace complex lies a'gate' tower and a heavily populated fancy dress hire shop. Many locals and tourists alike hire costumes and enact traditional Korean life all around the city. Glorious and fun!"
"The Huwon Secret Garden Tour is highly recommended for its gorgeous autumn foliage!!! Only 100 tickets are available daily of which 50 are reserved for online booking. u need to create an account in order to book your tickets.

The tour is highly restricted & u are not allowed to wander off by yourself. A guard will follow your group to ensure that everyone stays together.

The guide is humourous and interesting. This tour is a must-do if u are in Seoul!!!"
"A much often overlooked attraction compared to its more renowned 'sister' palace, the Gyeongbokgong.

The palace grounds are larger and the palace was used as a residence for the royal family back in the old days. Recommend to visit during the autumn due to sights of the structures complemented by the bright colors of the autumn foliage"
Changdeokgung palace is a world heritage listed palace complex. It is indeed a very magnificent complex to visit and some of the inside buildings are accessible to the general public. One interesting area is the pharmacy building which has been furnished in the period of the reigning Joseon royalty. There was also an area that one could experience the beauty products made for the royal ladies. It is an expansive area to visit even though some areas are under extensive renovation. An added feature were visitors and locals dressed in traditional costumes taking advantage of the historical backdrop for photo ops. These individuals dressed in traditional garments added to the enchantment of this complex. We did not pay to visit the Secret Garden area. None the less it was still a very magical and enjoyable visit.
"This palace also has an extension which is called the secret garden. There is an additional fee of 5000 won to enter the secret garden, which has buildings set amidst trees and landscaping. The palace complex is vast and the guided tour took a lot of time. The guide was excellent in explaining the history and took pains to point out minute details of the palace. "
"I had heard about this palace and always wanted to visit it , so when i went for a meeting there i took a day out to see it.
It is an amazing palace,with elaborately planned structure and very apt for those days but still relevant for today. The authorities have done an excellent job of preserving the whole buildings very well with very well placed signs for tourists.One can hire guides and listen to the history.They also have head sets for translations.
It is a visit worth the time."
It is by far my favourite site in all Seoul. The palaces are interesting but the big highlight is the secret garden. The foliage in November was so so pretty. I wanted to spend just one hour and ended spending most of the afternoon. It was just super relaxing.
"Again as before, go with a guide and this palace comes to life.
Be prepared to walk, the treasure is the building architecture and the history."
"well kept, great area, loved the place, best pictures to take, will enter you directly to the seoul experiance"
This tour includes a guided tour of the palace grounds at night plus a performance at the end if the tour. We were served hot Korean tea in a disposable cup and given a goodie bag containing a purse and a bar of soap. It would have been nice if we were given some traditional Korean sweets instead of the soap. Try the moonlight tour if you want a different experience but do note the price is much higher than the day ticket.
Secret garden for the Palace is totally recommended for a visit during Autumn. The scenery is captivating.
"no wonder this palace is classify at the UNESCO; the construction is impressive and well preserved; you will like the different color tiles and sculptures; if you go in summer, make sure you go early as it can be really hot there."
"Changdeokgung and the adjacent Changgyeonggung are my favourties in Seoul. In spring they have beautiful cherry blossoms and in autumn they have attractive autumn colours. However, the summer in Seoul this year was long and dry, so the autumn colours were quite disappointing."
"A beautiful palace, ine of the nicest in Seoul. There are many events and weddings going on on premise with traditional clothing."
"Changdeokgung is by far my favorite palace in Seoul due to the secret garden... if you are visiting it, I recommend you take the secret garden tour as well.. totally worth it!"
"Like Gyeongbokgung Palace, my wife and I been to the day before, Changdeokgung Palace offers visitors many, many photography opportunities.

My wife rented a hanbok from one of the numerous hanbok rental shops in the palace's vicinity and for 4 hours, we toured the palace snapping away on my camera. Just like Gyeongbokgung Palace, we had no idea what the significance of any of historical building/ artifact we were looking at since we were without a guide. But hey, our family album has been significantly fattened up after that trip.

If you are into culture and history, follow a guide.

Pro Tip: The man at the entrance taking visitors' admission tickets, told me that because my wife was wearing a hanbok, she did not need to pay admission. However, the line back at the ticketing booth was too long so I could not be bothered to go back to refund her ticket.

So, do not quote me on this. Go find out if this is indeed the case and save yourself some Korean won!"
"I think If you just see one temple in Seoul this needs to be the one! The secret garden is amazing and pro tip you don’t need to do a tour, you can do it alone"
I went to Changdeokgung Palace on a Sunday afternoon. It has less much people than Gyeongbokgung Palace. But I was not disappointed. I had opportunity to take many beautiful photos with interruption from other tourists. Don't expect grand buildings here as well as other palaces in Seoul. It offers a different kind of beauty and experience comparing to palaces in Beijing.
Joined the 11.30am tour which was made very interesting by our guide. Plenty to see and the garden are extensive to walk around in.
To a Westerner there seems little difference between the many palaces of Seoul but Changdeokgung stands out because of the beautiful Secret Garden tour. When you finish the tour the gate to Changgyeonggung is just on your left - not as interesting but worth a quick look if you have the palace pass.
I went there in the last Wednesday of the month - when all museum and culture sites are free. Of course there were a lot of people wondering by. The people dressed in the traditional Korean clothes gives a nice feel to it all.
"Very impressive, colourful, well maintained, and beautiful buildings, Lots to explore, guides are available. You can also visit the secret garden an adjacent palace and gardens, all for an amazingly reasonable entry fee. Allow half a day to have a good look."
The palace was amazing and the architecture overall is really nice. Unfortunately we couldn’t go into the secret garden because the tickets were sold out. But the small lake and the rest of the park around the palace was really beautiful especially with the changing leaves of the trees.
Maybe the best among the five big palaces of the city. Do not miss the secret gardens (close earlier that tha palace).
"We had very limited time at Seoul, so I only had the option to visit 1 palace during my trip. As we rented hanbok at Bukchon Hanok Village, we decided to go to Changdeokgung as it is a bit closer. The palace is not that big, but we had ample time taking pictures within the palace as there were not many visitors on that day. I wish we could have more time to join the tour for secret garden."
The palace grounds are quite extensive with large ponds and a separate garden area which costs extra but worth seeing. Initially you have a guide but you can leave the group to look around on your own if you want.
"Very busy when attended, but still an enjoyable experience, ornate decorations and gardens, once inside easy to forget you are in middle of city."
This is another great palace. It is not the biggest one but still one of the five more important ones.
"Online tickets to the secret garden always sold out. You can go directly to the palace and get the tickets over there. If you need a guided tour (Won10,000) and it will last for 1 hour. But if you are in a hurry, you can get the ticket for just Won1000. You can get the ticket either at the main entrance or right in front of the garden entrance. Highly recommended you go visiting the garden as it is very serene and beautiful and it is an easy walk."
"Admissions is cheap here, and to be able to stroll the grounds of the palace makes it a worthy destination for the tourist visiting Seoul."
Use the side entrance— no one is there and you don’t have to wait in the really long lines at the main entrance. For me and nieces it was 6k won. Game changer.
"Beautiful! Definitely worth walking around for a bit - especially since it's so close to Bukchon Hanok Village, Insa-dong, etc. Didn't do the secret garden tour, but wish I had. Gorgeous colors, as is typical with Korean architecture."
"Beautifully restored palace that is worth a visit. Be prepared for a lot of walking, a lot of steps - so this isn't necessarily great for someone who is challenged with either. But otherwise, it's great to visit and be able to wander at your own pace through all the buildings and admire the grounds.

Notes:
- Get the audioguide, it's well worth it
- If you have to pick just one palace, I would still go for the larger and grander Gyeongbokgung
- If you are planning to visit Changdeokgung as well, you should couple this palace with it as the two abut each other and there is an internal ticketing and entry point from this palace to Changdeokgung"
"This is like a smaller version of the main palace in Beijing. It is designed very similarly, though a little smaller. The buildings were rebuilt after the Japanese occupation from 1910-1935, when it was torn down. They actually had underground heating before the Chinese did. It is a beautiful place. Try and see the guard change ceremony; it's amazing. There is a lot of walking and there are really big stairs. This is not a place for people with movement issued. I was really tired but the end. We had a guide and I would suggest one if you really want to understand this place. What a wonderful experience."
"À Seoul must-go
Do not forget to check the time of the changing of the Gate’s guards. Think about coming in advance!
You can also try to wear a rented hanbok(traditional clothes). That is an unforgettable experience!"
I hired the traditional “hanbok” dress to wear to the palace and get nice photos. This place is perfect for photos and the architecture and history is beautiful. Wearing the traditional dress made it more surreal and it really felt like you were there. It is a huge place so bring water and get as much photos as you can.
"We were so tired and decided we would not give it justice, so came back for a second visit the next day, we saw the secret garden. So calming and beautiful."
"Sure this is a beautiful place you need to visit when in Seoul.
Nice palace a garden normally plenty of tourist, but quite large to breath."
Going through centuries of Korea history in a palace which was the headquarter of several Korean dynasties. Getting to know Korean history and its rich culture.
"Great palace. Even better if you rent a hanbok from the shop opposite the entrance for around W15,000 - free entry into the palace if you’re wearing traditional korean dress (doesn’t apply for the secret garden)"
"Honestly, I prefer this palace if compare to Gyeongbokgung Palace. Beautiful landscape and has a mixture of different era building. Some part of the palace was rebuilt after being burned down. Joined a free English walking tour and got to know more about a beautiful story of the king family."
Very much enjoyed wandering around this UNESCO site. Now regret that we didn’t do the Secret Gardens but we were tiring.
We had a good time visiting this place. We came on weekend and had many locals dressed with traditional clothes. Plenty to do for 2-3 hours.
"Interesting Palace to learn about ancient Korea and its architecture.The English tour guide to the hills and valleys of the Secret Garden was a superb insight to the life and times of the early dynasties.
The Palace is spread over a wide area, which is mainly flat, but there are some steep areas, so allow plenty time to visit.Crowds,queues,heat not a problem in September."
Highly recommend visiting at least one palace during your stay to South Korea. We visited two and they were both beautiful.
"beautiful architecture, amazing way to learn about South Korean history. Small entrance fee, was definitely worth the visit. Took about 2 hours to truly visit each part of the palace. Guides were very accommodating, even with limited English"
Don't miss the Secret Garden! Definitely worth pre-booking in advance and one of the highlights of my visit to Seoul. The palace itself is also interesting and very well preserved.
"We took a tour (booked thru trip advisor) where we had a private guide and a choice of destinations. We chose this one since we could do Gyeongbokgung by ourselves. A bit smaller (less walking), but more time for guide to explain things."
"We visited this place with two children.
It is beautiful place and lots to see
Highly recommend.
Give enough time .
Lots of walking .
We took English speaking guide,
Bit disappointed as she spoke very fast and did not allow group together to catch up.
Go early as not to miss changing of guard and visit to Gardens.

"Changdeokgung Palace is the most well-preserved Palace from the Joseon Dynasty. This is the place where the King and their ministers dicussed about Political affairs and was the residence of the Royal Family, too.
As all the palaces, it was burnt during the japanese invasion and, later, it was rebuilt.
Do not let to visit the Secret Garden and enjoy its peaceful atmosphere."
"This palace is quieter than the central site. It's close to Bukchon Village and great places to eat and cafes. Just a beautiful, sprawling historical landscape."
"Visited this Palace first & picked up a free guide outside the Palace. These are students that are practicing their languages & are very helpful & friendly. They wear orange tops & can be found outside the entrance area. They give an excellent overview without going into too much depth.
The Palace architecture is lovely, but the buildings contain very little themselves.
Tickets can be purchased to access the secret garden too. This does require an official guide & your given your tour start time. The guide is very helpful & informative & does go into lots more detail. As you meander through the gardens, mainly trees, there are pavilions & water feature areas. The walk/tour does have steeper areas.
Both are worth a visit it you want a feel for Royal living"
"The Changdeokgung Palace is smaller than Gyeongbokgung (faster to see if you are short on time) and quite beautiful. With more time visiting both on the same day is possible. Entry is 3,000 won for adults and 1,500 won for youth, garden an additional 5,000/2,400. The palace can be appreciated wandering on your own or guided tours are available in Korean, Chinese, Japanese, and English throughout the day. It can get a little crowded so a morning visit may be a better option than afternoon (opens at 0900 daily). Really an interesting place and amazing to imagine the royalty living in these buildings not too long ago."
"Please do not miss the GARDEN. It was gorgeous and the guide was outstanding. If I had one palace to go to ,this would be it,but I would take the garden over the palace itself if the time was limited.
The guide did a wonderful job of conveying the feel of life in the palace and within the garden.
This was a favorite activity during my time in Seoul."
This was a secondary palace of the Joseon Dynasty that ruled from 1392 -1910. The original palace was built in 1405 and was secondary to the bigger palace just down the road. It was destroyed when the Japanese invaded between 1592 -1598 and was rebuilt in 1610. This was an impressive series of buildings and definitely worth a look. Access is via Ext 3 of the Anguk Station.
"We went to the palace on the Korean Thanksgiving Day, so entry was free. However, we had booked a walking tour of the secret garden. The tour was in English, and you can only go into the secret garden with a guide. It is not accessible to the general public. Our guide was very sweet, and very knowledgeable about the history of the palace and the garden. The walk lasts 90 minutes, and there are 4 stops along the way. It is hilly in parts and somewhat shady, but on a warm day a fan is advisable to help keep cool. After the tour we were free to explore the palace, which has many buildings. There was a gift shop where you could also buy a drink but not food. There are 5 palaces in Seoul, but we chose to visit this one purely for the secret garden tour and we were glad we did."
"Changdeokgung Palace has a timeless beauty that will make you visit again and again. It is no wonder why the ancient kings and royalties preferred here than the main palace. We are lucky to be in time for the 1030am guided tour into the palace's secret garden, a huge garden with Instagram worthy pavilion. The best pavilion is the one with the mini rice paddy field!"
"Beautiful visit, The koreans have rebuilt this site to look very authentic and with a great eye for detail. The buildings itself are beautiful but when you add the awesome scenery in the background it becomes an epic picture perfect experience.

To enjoy the experience to the fullest, be sure to arrive early. If you come at noon it is packed with tourist which for me really ruins the experience.

HOT TIP!!! If you dress in traditional Korean attire, you can get free access!"
"I think many people do not realise that if you visit at either 10 am or 2pm you can see the changing of the guards. If you are visiting it makes sense to see this.
The Palace is quite substantial and well maintained. Interesting to watch all the folks dressed in traditional style Korean outfits taking photos!
A nice few hours and right next to the Buchan Hanok village."
"It was our first day in Seoul, and having our small rented apartment nearby and it was a free entry day, it was our first visit!
If I say it set the tone for similar visits over our 4 days in Seoul , I would not say we were greatly impressed! The great halls are quite impressive in themselves ( although most parts are later reconstructions resulting from hostile events in Japanese/Korean history! However , overall, the site seems to lack any coherence to help the visitor to understand the history of the place! There is very little access INTO any of these buildings and rather too many notices "" Do not step!"" A big minus point in this and seemingly most of the central Seoul historic sites is the use of SAND on most of the pathways in the complex! Seoul seems to be quite a windy city , even when summer temperatures top 35 degrees, everything is covered in a thin layer sand , including visitors! We did pay for a guided tour of the Secret Garden, really not a greatly rewarding experience ( even if you could understand the guide's English ) but you're not allowed to go around except on a tour?"
"The Changeokgungn Palace s beautiful and it is big! In the center of the city, it’s gardens and paths are peaceful. It was quite hot the day we visited, but shade was abundant and the various buildings were very interesting. Signs were helpful to gain insights and understanding. We enjoyed our 2 hour stroll among the sights and gardens. It is well worth the visit."
"nice place for photoshoot with your hanbok.
with hanbok, you go inside for free.

i booked a secret garden tour and its nice but do this only if you have time. garden of morning calm is far better."
"The palace is one of history and culture. It is worthwhile to book a docine or guide to take you around as there are statures and carvings that have meanings, as well as entrances that were for kings or servants, which you wouldn't necessarily know about.
The palace and grounds are huge! we went on a warm day in summer and it was very pleasant however we did spend hours walking. The palace is free to walk around, however the King's gardens are not, so try to book a session the day before if it is a busy tourist time."
The is very impressive palace. I have re-visited this palace after 10 years. I could not see the guardians in front of main gate. The watch-change ceramony was very fescinating. Thre are lots of buildings in the palace with very special fuctionality. I suggest you to join a tour with guidance. the icture on cailing are impressed me.
"Place is Ok, compared to any other country palace this place is way below my expectations.
Only worth it if you wanna dress up with the kimono thing for the photo."
"Lovely palace, great pic opprtunities. Loads of korean/chinese style buildings. Just a short walk from city Hall station. Lovely place to relax."
"Having seen old architecture in surrounding countries, the Korean style shows its own characteristics - a bit more austere than Chinese temples - and different color palette."
"The palaces are beautiful and the grounds are well-landscaped. The original buildings were burned by the Japanese during their occupation of Korea, so these are recreations, but feel ancient. The guides at the library are very kind and helpful providing very interesting information. Take your time, there is a lot to see. It is also common to see people dressed in the garb of that time period which really adds to the atmosphere as you wander the grounds. There is so much history here. And if you are there in the summer, bring the sun umbrellas. It is hot and rain is frequent at that time of year. The little cafe has limited offerings, so you may want to bring food. Note of caution: If you take the Hop On Hop Off bus, they drop you off a quite a ways from the entrance. It is better to get off at the stop prior; it is much closer to the entrance."
Lovely place filled with history. There is so much to see. We did t have time to do the secret gardens. It was a very good visit.
We booked hanboks online before our arrival so were admitted for free and spent 2 1/2 hours wandering the grounds and taking pictures. We saw many Korean school groups who asked to take pictures with my blond kids and read us paragraphs in English. Everyone was so friendly. We lucked into watching the changing of the guard so look for the times on the website. Very little shade there so a hat or umbrella would be nice. Don’t miss it!
"Beautiful palace, but the true highlight is the Secret Garden. 90 minute tour with no more than 100 others - it sounds like a lot, and to be honest this was the most tourists we saw in one place in all the palaces.

The tour guide was knowledgeable - and stated key facts (e.g. shooting locations for Netflix's Kingdom and the history).

Be careful with the Secret Garden if you have health issues, as there are steep slopes up and down and uneven terrain. Would not recommend with a push chair or wheelchair (although it says you can do).

The rest of the Palace is alright in comparison, but you need to access the Palace to access the Secret Garden.

Get both as part of the Royal Palace Pass - note, on the day you need to go to a ticket office to book a specific time slot for the Secret Garden - this is all explained in the ticket book."
"This palace is huge. Slightly bigger in area then Gyeongbokgung but this is a UNESCO heritage site. A secret garden tour cost additional 5000W to the entrance fees of 3000W. The tour is conducted hourly and take you into the inner part of the palace compound with a guide who gives further insight and explanation. Here you will be able to see more pavilion, ponds and gardens. The tour takes 90 minutes and involved walking up and down the hilly path."
"A Beautiful Place in the heart of Seoul.
It's pretty similar to Gyeongbokgung palace and not too far from it.
With no doubt a must see during a visit in Seoul.
Ticket Price is only 3.000 won, but the day I went was free entry."
"The palace has nothing special but is good for the Korean Traditional dress called Hanbok experience and photos.

Just accors the road ( opposite to this palace) there is a shop for Traditional dress rental. They charge around kRW 15000 for 2 hours rental for dress. They provide all facilities like rentals lockers within this price. Ladies hair dress is additional KRW 5000. Overall a good experience to go for this.

Please also note that in case you are wearing the Traditional clothes the entry fee to palace is waived off.

The place is easily accessible through public transport.

The palace may be hot is summer and mostly uncovered in case of rain. So better carry an umbrella in summary or rainy season.

No F&B option in palace. Better to carry your water bottles.

They have washroom inside."
"everyone who visit to korea have to visit here!
i will try secret garden next time.
so sad i missed it"
"Although it was a very hot (42°C) day, I challenged myself to walk through the whole domain, and it was worth the sweat :)
A big domain with beautiful old, cultural buildings. An additional touch is given by the possibility to dress in typical clothing, and there is the change of guards as well.
Not expensive for the time you can spend here."
"There are 5 palaces in Seoul, but this UNESCO heritage site was the favored one of Joseon Dynasty rulers; the palace is meant to blend in with its natural surroundings with beautiful hues of green and floral designs.
We went on a rainy day and either the weather or the site itself meant the crowds were minimal. In addition, we got free admission because many sites have free admission for the weeks around National Liberation Day.
While we covered only a few buildings, I appreciated the architecture and designs. We would definitely return again and wear hanbok as well!"
"Does not have the changing of the guard, but it does have the Secret Garden. There is construction, so the free tours are cut short. The construction will be ongoing through 2020."
"Interesting palace in some nice grounds, well worth a visit, recommend walking to the garden area at the rear where the glasshouse is."
"On the day of our visit, the entrance ticket was free except for access to the Secret Garden which I did not take. The place is nice & calm to visit with nice open pavilions and courtyards but that's probably every area of the palace. I've read reviews about Secret Garden being absolutely beautiful, so if you do visit this palace, I highly recommend paying the entrance fee to the Secret Garden."
It is like a mirror that shows us how this developed world emerged from its unique history. Soldiers make a morning show for visitors.
"Having lived in Korea for almost a year now, I think it's fair to say that I've had my fair share of temples and palaces. I almost didn't go to this one, but I'm glad that I did! I like the flair and vibe of this palace a lot more than Gyeongbokgung. The layout of the palace made me feel like I was truly exploring ancient Korea. Make sure to try hanbok when you go (it was around ₩15,000 for 4 hours and the rental store that I went to was right across the street from Chandeokgung), as it authenticates the experience!"
"""It's a must go when visiting Korea."" That's what I was thinking when planning to visit Korea and I was so right. I bought the ticket of the secret garden online and checked their free general tour schedule before we went. With two experienced tour guides (for general tour and secret garden), we had a great time to walk into the ancient Korea."
"Changdeokgung is a UNESCO World Heritage listed site. It is a superb example of Josean Dynesty architecture. It is the main palace of the 5 in Seoul. There are free guided tours of the palace (in English) but a self guided tour is good enough unless you really need to know the finer points of Josean Dynesty royal life. Entry is only 3000KW approximately £2. There is a royal palace pass which gives access to 4 palaces and Jongmyo Shrine, it costs 10,000KW, but the combined cost of all the individual sites is 9,000KW!!"
"We went for the complimentary English tour. The guide spoke good and clear English compared to other tours we did in Seoul. I do recommend going for the guided tour to really understand and appreciate this magnificent palace. The Secret Garden tour is also recommended. Changdeokgung is included in integrated ticket for the palaces. A very good deal if you have enough time to go all 4 palaces, Secret Garden and Jongmyo Shrine."
"This is the most special of all the palaces and probably the one to visit in case you plan on doing one only. The palace is spacious with large open places. Tourists are not allowed inside much of the covered areas and most of the time you are out in the open. So it can be harsh during summers. But still if you are touring seoul this is one of the must do activities. Just be prepared for the walk and the sun.
The secret garden tour is amazing and can only be taken as a guided tour of roughly 70 min duration in summers and 90 during other times. Most of cultural heritage sites including this palace in seoul are free to enter from Aug 10 -25, due to National Liberation Day celebrations...however secret garden tour is paid and needs to be booked atleast a day prior. There is a souvenir and refreshment shop inside for the tourists. From the inside one can also tour the Changgyeonggung palace since the two are connected. The entire tour including the palaces and secret garden can take from 2-3 hours."
"Traditional architecture. The palace has been restored, as well as most of the historical buildings destroyed during the war."
"A very beautiful complex of palaces providing a good insight into Korean history. As the distance between the different buildings can be quite large one should allocate sufficient time. Also there are many people wearing traditional Korean costumes, making it a very interesting experience."
"I feel like after about 3-4 of these, they all start looking the same and you just are like ""meh"", that's how I was anyway after visiting this. For me, the real cool part of the palace is the secret garden. Amazing serene spot free of tourists and great for photos."
The Gyeongbokgung Palace was packed and a very long queue of people so taking a TripAdvisor's suggestion we came here. Beautiful buildings and a calm atmospher so happy with my choice.
Can recommend .Make sure you bring water in summer .very big palace .some palaces will look the same .important to us was that we allowed enough time to sit down and take it in .
"If you rent the typical Korean clothes, you can enter the palace for free. Otherwise you need to pay for a ticket. There are many stores that offer the Korean clothes for rent. The gardens and the palace itself is a half day visit that is really impressive."
"I visited this palace as part of a Seoul City Tour company tour. It was very helpful to have a tour guide explain this palace to us. This palace was used for mainly residential purposes. The palace is huge with many buildings as well as a garden. It also is on the Lonely Planet's Ultimate Travel List, and it has a Traveler's Choice award.

I was surprised that this site was not very busy. This is an important part of Korean's history and culture."
"Very stage managed parade for changing of the guards, very bright and colourful costumes.
Museum on site"
"Really enjoyed this trip, always like to tour round places like this, and this time it was a family tour, some of our members spoke Korean so we didn't need a tour guide"
Stumbled upon it by accident. It's cute. The admission price is very reasonable. The palace itself and the surrounding grounds are very well looked after.
"What made this palace stand out was the excellent English-language tour guide who filled out time there with colorful stories of the previous residents of this palace. We highly recommend that you join one of the frequent tours (including with admission). It will make the place come alive, instead of being just another palace. We did not go on to tour the gardens, but were very happy with what we learned on just the palace tour. Do not miss this when you're in Seoul!"
"This palace is not as crowded and has a huge secret garden or forbidden garden that occupies about 60% of the palace compound. The garden was only accessible to the Korean kings and royal family in the past. The palace itself is not big. There are free guided tours of palace around 1 hour available in english, chinese and korean. The palace entrance fee is very affordable at around USD3/pax. Garden guided tour fee is a separate fee at USD4/pax and garden tour takes 70 mins. Worth a visit."
"This palace is smaller than Gyeongbokgung palace, but it is still very large, and unlike the larger one, has more original buildings. I recommend taking the english language tour. I feel I got a lot more out of it than just looking at all the pretty buildings, but if you don't have time, grab an english map at the entrance. Also, the signs throughout are in several languages. I also took the secret garden tour, which costs extra. It took me several hours to see everything. I liked this palace best. The tourists and locals walking around in Hanboks made for good pictures too."
This palace is small than Gyengbokgung but very beautiful with traditional architecture. There is a way links to the Deoksugung which have a lake and very unique glass house. It might take 2 hours to visit this place.
"The architecture and history here are engrossing. However, the Secret Garden Tour is the highlight, worth the additional entry fee. Available in English."
"This is an absolutely beautiful palace, with gorgeous gardens. It is extremely peaceful and a wonderful place to spend an afternoon.
We took the English guided tour and loved it. The palace is large and well cared for. You can't go inside the buildings which is too bad. I originally thought they were too old but in fact most of the palaces in Seoul are reproductions. Every time Korea was invaded the palaces were torn down.
The reason I didn't give it 5 stars is the lack of accessibility for wheel chairs. They do provide wheelchairs but the one I used was not well maintained; it was extremely difficult to push and part way through the tour I had to turn back because of a staircase."
"Absolutely magnificent palace complex. I spent about 5 hours wandering around the inner and outer court before exploring the palace itself and the secret gardens.
I was mesmerised by it to be honest. I intended to spend a couple of hours, a half day at most, but ended up spending pretty much a whole day here.
The gardens are extra, 5000 won, but are well worth it. The place is stunning obviously but don't rush through the inner and outer courtyards as they are just as enchanting.
One of the best days I've had on tour in a long, longt ime and definitely the best and most beautiful attraction in Seoul. An absolute must-do in my opinion."
My wife wanted to visit here and thus we did lol. It was okay - saw the changing of the guard and we walked around the grounds for an hour or so. I feel that once you have seen one Korean palace... you have seen them all. My better half enjoyed it...
"This is the secondary palace, but has more sections that are authentic and not as rebuilt in the 1980s. Really gorgeous and also like a nature hike in the middle. The Secret Garden is a must-do part of the visit. The English-speaking guide who was assigned for everyone (you can't walk solo) was terrific, one of the best guides of my Seoul visit. We found the palace fascinating and gorgeous, and it's not very far from Bukchon."
"The structures tell stories and the value of the people residing in them. Although there are some sad stories behind the Palace, still it is amazing to know that Koreans preserve their heritage.
Read the landmarks placed in every area so that you'll appreciate more of the structures, the rooms, the gates.

The secret garden is a different ticket but it is the most relaxing part of the tour.. You can sense the peaceful vibe of the nature and the calm effect of the ponds near the study area.. There are stories behind every location and it is good to know them also.. You'll learn about Joseon dynasty and how princes and kings walked down the relaxing lane of greenery, and partly of their beliefs and traditions during the tour if you listen well to your guide. English guides have time slots so make sure you know the schedule and be there on time.

Old doesn't mean dull, but it is rich in history, and beauty.. If given the chance, I would still go back here.. (on another season.. =)"
"A very beautifully decorated and in many ways a spectacular place. Old and full of history. Certainly worth a visit. The secret gardenis nice, but on the guided tour, which you must take to visit, you see mainly small temples and buildings, while the garden itself is really more a densely grown park. A little dissapointing. As is the palace surroundings which really are just grass and gravel. Very little you can see of the interior of the palace, so it is relatively quickly done unless you have a strong interest in 17c Korean architecture."
"This is one of the main palaces of the Joseon Dynasty. It is the most well-preserved, with many structures, gates, rooms, halls and pavilions. The palace is famous for its rear secret (Huwon) garden. A separate ticket is required to visit the rear garden and must join a 90 mins guided tour. The vast garden was a resting place for the royal family and is beautifully landscaped in a way that held on to the original nature of the space. The garden was kept as natural as possible. There are many pavilions, pond and greenery that occupy the compound.

I purchased the palace combo ticket, 10,000 won, which entitles to visit 4 palaces and the Jogmyo shrine."
"Just visit if you do have at least 3 hs to go to every place in this complex of buildings and gardens. You can visit all of it for wons 9.000. Even a secret garden excursion. This place and gardens are breathtaking.
Although the buildings lack more historical information in booklets or audio guided visits it is stills worth it."
It's a wonderful place to add in your Itinerary to have a glimpse of Korea's rich history. Enjoyed walking thru their courtyard and the huge structures that they have in the grounds.
A must visit to this UNESCO site! Peaceful and glorious. A nicer palace to wander around and well preserved buildings. Secret Garden tour must be booked ahead of time and highly recommended
"I’d premise this with the fact it was an exceptionally hot and humid day we visited Changdeokgung palace which definitely impacted our enjoyment. The gardens are the main reason to visit and they are lovely (no flowers, all trees and greenery when we went in June - well maintained) but I would say beyond walking around the gardens, there wasn’t much to do. The entry price was only 1,000 won which is cheap but for that you can’t get inside any of the buildings and when it is hot, it’s a bit relentless.

So in short I’d recommend a short visit but not on a hot day."
"Not as beautiful as the Gyeongbokgung to be honest and you must go to the secret garden following a guife, you cannot enter by yourself and it's not worth one and half hour.."
This is a group of Palaces and Temples on large grounds. Not far from Gyeonghbokgung. There is a separate entrance and fee for the Gardens.
"Changdeokgung Palace is one of Korea's ""Five Grand Palaces'. It is definitely worth a visit. To explore the whole complex takes several hours, but a shorter visit is still very worthwhile. This was part of our tour of South Korea and Mongolia. As at other palaces in Sepul, there are many locals in traditional clothes. Although not required, it is best to have a guide at this site.."
A portion of palace grounds is limited to a daily quota of visitors and only accompanied by palace guide. This is the Secret Garden which was the recreational forest of the palace. About an hour the tour involves fair amount of walking and changes of elevation.
"Honestly by now I have gone through most of the palaces in Seoul and this one impressed me with its beauty and diversity. I do have to mention that to get into certain parts of the palace you need to pay again, but it doesn't lessen the value of the palace. It is simply beautiful to be there and very meditative. Simply go!"
"Both the buildings and grounds of this palace are delightful -- and it is easily accessible being just a couple of blocks from the Anguk (Line 3, Exit 3) metro stop. For admission to the Secret Garden, one muist have a reservation -- but for seniors (65+), entrance to the palace is free of charge."
Must see part of any visit to Seoul..in fact the main attraction. Many Asian and Korean visitors hire traditional dress for the visit which adds to the spectacle. There is a guard changing ceremony you can view at around 10.30A.M so time your visit...lasts around 15 minutes. Leave max two hours for a good tour around and as always best to visit with a guide to get the most of the history. Very modern and clean restrooms on site as well as a decent cafe. Some great views of the temple with the mountain backdrop.
"Following the Japanese Invasion both the first and main Gyeongbokgung Palace and this secondary palace were destroyed, but Changdeokgung Palace was rebuilt quickly and then became the main palace. This unique Korean palace was built in harmony with the landscape and is a true beauty. I did not go to the Secret Gardens though. It is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Walking thru both Palaces and the Bukchon Hanbok Village will take up much of your day so it's best to get an early start and then head to Insadong Street to browse and eat. These are some of the best sites to see in this section of Seoul."
"Visited with the student volunteers from Meteor Youth. The palace grounds are beautiful and the official hall with the emperor seat is stunning. Do make sure you book the tour for the secret garden. I would recommend you do the 90 mins tour of the secret garden first then visit the palace after. The gardens situated behind the grounds of the palace is huge and boasts many pavilions with beautiful ornate carvings, each with a different design. Do note that the tour entails a lot of walking uphill so be prepared. Another thing to note is that entrance to the secret garden and palace requires different ticket. The palace tickets also have different timings ie day ticket and evening tickets.

I was glad I went with the student volunteers as they were able to provide commentary throughout the visit."
"This was the second palace I visited and it was the better of the 2. It was ready to get to. I arrived at 9 and it was a great time for picture taking before the crowds. Later school children showed up and it was a lot busier. I took the free English your at 10:15 and paid for the secret garden tour at 11:30. I suggest you take the garden tour, well worth it. There are his to climb, so be aware. You can opt to return to the palace ground before the more strenuous party of the tour."
"Visited this place while wearing Hanbok and hence got a free entrance. It is smaller than the Gyeongbukgung palace but it is also very well kept and maintained. One of the highlights of this palace would be the secret garden tour which is highly recommended! Do remember to book/reserve the tickets online prior to visiting the palace to avoid disappointment as it can get very popular. Would advise going earlier in the day to avoid the sun and people to get good photos :)

Tour was fun and we saw the harvesting festival with Koreans dressed in the traditional costumes celebrating the harvesting season. Definitely worth going!"
"We were glad that we were able to join the guided tour in English of the Secret Garden at the back portion of this palace and to learn more about Korean History and life of royals, and how the palace was used. It is nice that Korea was able to preserve this for people to visit and appreciate."
The different palaces and the Korean architecture is very fascinating. Very beautiful place and it feels like travelling to the past as I was walking and seeing different palaces.
This is one of the most visually beautiful palaces to visit in Seoul. Not only are the structure stunning from the outside with their beautifully painted motifs but the insides are stunning as well including some interesting furnished pieces. Make sure you book tickets for the secret garden ahead of time as it can only be done via a guided tour. It was the highlight of our visit. It is nice to visit via tour as there are less people making the experience more relaxed and it’s easier to take photos with no one in them.
I think my expectation was way too high and the day I visited was a cold day without much sun. That's why I was little disappointed and it would have been so much better if the day was warmer and brighter.
"Not bad but doesn't compare to the temples elsewhere in South East Asia. Its expansive lots of areas to explore but no magic ""wow"" moments!"
"The palace is very nice, but the garden is so much nicer. Lots of trees, so a nice place to visit on a hot day. Entering the garden is kinda weird. You have to buy a ticket for a specific time and only at that time you can enter the garden, even though the sign at the garden entrance says you can just go in on your own. You can choose to do a guided tour or walk around on your own."
"Missed the flowers in season, but still a huge and great palace to visit. Lots of space and greenery. You can pay and go into the secret garden but the next tours were booked so we didn’t bother waiting hours"
"This is a great place to visit lots of history right in front of you perfectly preserved for tourists and Koreans who want to visit the local palaces. There are many palaces in Seoul but this is a very nice one which really is nicely preserved and is super easy to navigate though. There paths are not good for people with mobility issues and I don’t think you could get a wheelchair in here. There is very little share and there is nothing in the palace to drink so make sure you bring water along.

Great for all members of the family of all ages. Get yourself a hanbok and have a really traditional experience"
"This palace is not smaller than Gyeongbokgung, but with the secret garden maybe the most beautiful one. Still always many tourists and local people, but not as crowded as Gyeongbokgung. Many photogenic spots, quiete enough to make good interesting instagram photos."
"It’s unclear what, if anything, is the original structure. It has been reconstructed with bits from another palace which makes it all seem a bit pointless, especially since they point out that many structures were modified in the process. Is this really what the palace looked like? And what parts are original, from the other palace, or new from the restoration which began in the 1990’s?

You can’t go into any of the ”historical” buildings (from the 1990’s..?) which means you only see exteriors and the occasional glance through and open window or door.

There is very little written information in English (or any other language for that matter). To enter the garden you have to join the English speaking guided tour which only runs 3-4 times a day, and since it’s a limited number of people per tour, chances are likely that you won’t get tickets unless you booked in advance. Although I can’t say I’m terribly disappointed in not getting a spot for the garden since I wasn’t very impressed with the palace to begin with.

I wouldn’t recommend this one."
"Glad that we sign up for this moonlight tour. The atmosphere at night was so different from the day where it was much more peaceful except that it can be quite scary if you're walking alone. It's so beautiful at night walking around with a lantern on hand.

Get to see more of it and understand better from the guided tour despite having tour this place in the last trip."
"Is good place to have an look of their historical past which i wonder why the area is quite small in compare with palaces in other countries.
Good photo taking with modern building surrounding the palace"
"One of my focus when I travel is to see and feel authentic architecture of the country that I travel to. But my wife has a different reason why we have to get into this palace, and it’s the Secret Garden, because that’s where her favorite Korean soap opera stories are based on. It’s like a time travel for her, and she can’t stop telling me the whole plot of the story where the scene was shoot on the very ground where we were standing on....all I have to do is agree to all of it.

Take note of the schedules of the tour once inside because they offer it in different languages. The whole site is amazing, but half a day is good enough then you can move on to one of the Hanok villages nearby so that you can have a good comparison of how the royalties and the the common people live their lives. Do the tours yourself, the sites are just a short taxi ride from your hotel if you are around Meongdong area."
"I came here to see history and culture of Korea. I really enjoyed it. The palace is beautiful, and there are things, like crafts to do around the area."
Went after lunch and was not as crowded as the other palaces. Unfortunately the secret garden was closed. Still lots of things to see.
"I visited Changdoeokgung palace at night. it;'s special event for Spring and Autumn only. if you love history then don't miss this event. I saw new atmosphere of palace under the light that was decorated for make each building look outstanding and attractive. there is many history about this place, but this time concept of this event it's about a prince in joeson dynasty who had many talent and very romance. story of him was remake to drama. anyway when walk to inside at night feel like to back to jeoson's time"
if you can rent a traditional outfit from the stores near by and wonder around like a local. It will help you appreciate the atmospher being recreated.
"in my own opinion, 2nd to Gyeongbokgung palace. there is a guided tour to the secret garden and you can book online. there is also a night tour of this Palace."
"Palace is just nice and interesting, but the walk in the secret garden is value added to it. In reality, you can enter only with a guided tour but you can after first longer stop take your own route!"
"I enjoyed my visit of Changdeokgung palace, however I do prefer Gyeongbokgung palace personally. Of course the secret garden was the best part about this palace and for me, the main reason for going. Worth a visit!"
"not too big
you can spend a time for 1-2 hour to walk around
there is a garden that you have to go with tour guide
in autumn it may very beatiful"
"Our family went there as part of a group tour. I strongly suggest you get a guide or someone who is well versed in the palace's history. Seeing the place without knowing its history or ties to Korean culture is such a sad experience. And of course, there are so many places to walk around and gets pictures. From architecture, flora, staff in traditional costumes among others.

We didn't get to rent or walk around in traditional korean clothes. That would have been awesome and probably the only downside we experienced of our visit."
"Very nice palace grounds, with the bonus of the (pay extra) secret garden. Free tour makes the visit more meaningful."
"Went to the Palace with the group but I didn't get enough time to look at everything so I went back on my own few days later. There was some dancing and the changing of the guards which was very colorful and noisy and very very interesting
Thete was also a very well presented publication which was free about the Palace. Many of the people there were in traditional costumes. There is no charge to go in. The Folk Park is located just up the street in the same area the admission us 3.000 won into the Palace from there but if you wear the traditional costume the price for admission is free.
Go to the folk park first and then the palaces. It is a good half day of exploring in wonderful surroundings."
"If you’re looking for a little history with beautiful scenery where kids can run around, this place is for you. Lots of tourists rent old Korean royalty costumes and explore the grounds like that, taking pictures. It’s relaxing and very pretty, signage is also in English but you could rent a live or audio tour if you want to learn more. A budget-friendly enjoyable experience."
"It was not so crowded as I went on weekday. Too bad the main entrance ticket didn't include entry to the secret garden, so didn't go in."
"The place was beautiful, it was big and we weren't able to go around the whole place. There was a different payment for the palace itself and the secret garden, we decided not to go inside anymore as there were a lot of people in line for the tickets.

It's a must-see if you love watching history K-dramas."
decent palace with a few guards outside. dint visit inside in particular since we had been to the biggest palace in seoul
This is the prettiest of Seoul's palaces and alot of it has to do with the secret gardens which is the highlight. Make sure you go on a guided tour as I think it makes the place come alive more when you understand the use of the buildings and the history of the Korean monarchy.
the hanbok renting opposite the palace offers worst experience for us for their services. did not recommend
"If you have a half day, I would highly recommend this place for a visit. First time that I have visited this outstanding Korean Palace. Lots of great places to take that Korea picture to send back home. The old style of Korea past is all around you. The government has done a great job in saving this jewel for all time. My wife told me that not all of the grounds were not always open to the public.

Just my thoughts:

You will need at 3 or 4 hours to see most of the grounds.

Wear your tennis shoes (loose gravel and uneven stairs).

Even though it says handicap accessible, most of the palace is not set up for wheelchairs.

You will also have problems with the kids stroller.

Plenty of toilets throughout the grounds.

Anyways, bring the camera and have a great time (we did)!"
"This palace comprises many different buildings and squares, all very photogenic. With limited time, I visited the queen's buildings. Well worth a longer stay"
"Nice place to see and understand about Korea architecture.
Starting from the gate which oposite the main gate of Green House, to the Museum and then straight to the palce.
Incredible about the culture and structure of Korea"
"Changdeokgung is divided into two major complexes, the palace complex and the secret garden complex. Each has its own tickets. The free entry perk of wearing hanbok (Korean traditional clothings) does not apply to Changdeokgung's secret garden. You still have to buy the ticket to get into the garden.

Perhaps because it was used as some sort of recreational lodge, Changdeokgung is constructed in a more scenic relax fashion than other palaces. I would say this is the Korean version of Versailles.

The rear garden has several interesting stops, but it will take quite an effort to walk down its hilly path. It definitely some stamina as the guide walk you roughly 1.5km up and down path. The garden is an GUIDED TOUR only section, you can't enter it alone. Make sure you check its schedule before you go.

The ideal duration to wander around at Changdeokgung, including its rear garden, can be 2hr 30 minutes. Its garden tour itself can last around 1hr 30minutes, spare yourself another one full hour to enjoy its palace complex. It is quite a spectacle as well.

Best time to visit Changdeokgung is early April (Spring, the cherry blossom season), and Autumn."
I came here around 9.30 am and it wasn't crowded. The entrance ticket is 3000 Won for palace only and 5000 Won if it's include the ''Secret Garden'' area. The design is not too different with Gyeongbokgung Palace but nice to spend some time here.
Well for my opinion after I have been to Gyeongbokgung the shape of the building look similar design. It's very nice to walk around the garden right next to the palace wall.
"Seoul is an interesting historic city. James, our guide, was very personable and fit our interests perfectly. He grew up in a small village after the Korean conflict and shared plenty of local details that few tourists ever know. The palace tour with the changing of the guards in costume was very entertaining. The walking tour of Seoul was fun, and the personal tour of the small Education Museum truly touching."
"It's the secondary palace used during the Joseon Dynasty and the Secret Garden is a must to visit as it's open at limit time for visitors only.

It's worth to visit and understand the information provided by the guide. It's a good time to explore during Spring from my view as the weather is great walking around the palace as I have great interest in the history of Korea."
"One of the attraction to visit, it is also close to shopping area and night market, close to train station and underground shopping area."
Inexpensive and fascinating. All the local palaces are a great place to visit. You get to see some pretty gardens and people dressed in authentic outfits.
The palace is open after dark which lends a whole new experience to palace visits. The lake is illuminated and it's fun to watch all the kids with lanterns.
"Definitely a must see. We got lucky and managed to get tickets for the secret garden tour at the ticket box the morning we visited. This palace has an extensive history. There are a lot of historical and architectural elements that can be overlooked or missed so I would definitely recommend a guide or tour on first visit, but it is easy to appreciate the beauty of the place without one."
"This is an excellent large site with some nicely restored buildings. It looks particularly good in April with the cherry blossom and the azaleas. The visit to the Secret Garden is the icing on the cake, although my visit was marred by the group being too large, with young people in period dress (nice touch),,,but they were too noisy and wanting to take selfies all the time. The Palace, like the others is free to 65+, but the garden costs, and it best to book on line to ensure a place."
"Caveat to this review is I’ve likely seen too many palaces over the years, and nothing in this one stands out.
What also detracts from the experience is that all the buildings were only built within the last 150 years as the originals were destroyed. So you are seeing fairly modern materials and construction techniques. It feels a bit staged as a result.

If you’re short on time and have seen an Asian palace before then you can afford to skip this one.

Final point: ‘the secret garden’ can only be accessed via the scheduled tours, which appear to depart every 2 hours. I didn’t do it."
"Never been to a Palace before. But this place is worth the visit.

The area is just so vast and you can see a lot of tourists on their hanbok dresses."
This palace is one of the Joseon Dynasty king's favorite and it is much beautiful and calmer than Gyeongbokgung since it is near the secret garden. It is the only palace in Seoul that has granted UNESCO World Heritage.
"Visited area and noticed this site lucky with weather today. Cool but no rain.
Access to site is by underground in area (line 2 green line) with both bus and taxi access easy.
Lots of restaurants and other eating houses around area.
Good market in area."
"We visited this this palace on a rainy day but this didn’t take anyway any of the beauty only some of the crowds!

A big palace with some beautiful buildings to explore.

Our highlight was the Secret Garden tour. We reserved this early as we heard it gets booked up fast! The tour is 90 minutes but so worth it. The gardens are so peaceful and well preserved and our English tour guide gave a thorough history and 5-10 minutes at each stop to wander and take our own pictures.

We would definitely recommdend a visit!"
"If you only have time for ONE palace, choose this one. It is more expansive -- has more trees and more structures. Better to book the secret garden tour ahead (esp. if you prefer the English tour) so that you plan your visit accordingly."
"Lots of building but all of the same decor, A lot of the place was destroyed by the Japanese and been refurbished. Still worth a walk around expect to spend around an hour. Changdeokgung place is adjacent to Changgyonggung Place with an inter connecting gate, there is an entrance fee for both places. So ideal to tie in at the same time. Over 65's have free entry on proof of age to both place.You can pay extra and have a guided tour of the secret garden which takes around 1.5 hours."
"We decided to stroll through the gardens in full Hanbok. We rented them from the little shop across the traffic lights from the front gate. 15000KW for 2 hours.
We then wandered the palace grounds (free entry) taking pictures. We were also asked to be in many other pictures from other tourists as we have very blond hair and blue eyes. It was a great experience.
The gardens were beautiful with Cherry Blossom blooming everywhere along the pathways.
Well worth the visit."
You stroll around all the buildings and rooms where Royal family members once lived together with their own garden which is very unique in Korean garden design. You can go there via Metro line #3: Ankook station from where it takes 10 minutes' walk.
"This is a lovely palace to walk around. Lots of things to see. It will only take you about and hour. You can dress up in national costume if you like, at a cost of course. Pretty gardens as well."
"Nearly didn’t come as we were already so tired from previous days including an earlier visit to Gyeongbokgung. Boy, am I glad I came! This to me is more beautiful and felt more authentic than Gyeongbokgung. As there were less visitors , we were able to wander around quietly at our pace. There also seemed to be better signages and explanation of the various venues at Changdeokgung. However some places were closed for renovation/ restoration. Could feel the weight of history on this place and to me, it felt sad and desolate. Did not manage to see the Secret Garden but will do so next time."
One of the most fascinating and well preserved royal residential palace from the Joseon Dynasty. Another UNESCO World Heritage site in Seoul.
"must see site
beside also a secret garden
has a cafe inside
huge palace grounds
has a 3ooo korean won entry fee"
"the visit will be nothing without the guided tour. the translated guided tour is free of charge, and the guide was knowledgeable. listening to the reasons behind every detail of the palace makes us really think there a lot more than the eyes can see.

very recommended!"
"If you’re into temples, palaces, history, parks, or a slower pace, head over to Changdeokgung Palace. Surrounded by modern skyscrapers, the palace built in 1405 feels like a time machine once you step through the large gates. The old architectural features have been maintained and you’re able to freely walk anywhere to get a glimpse of life behind the palace walls. Tickets are cheap at <$5 USD per person. The palace open from 10am to 6pm. This destination is kid friendly."
"I would recommend going here and visit it. It was worth it, and it was many things to look at. Definitely worth it"
"A very well-preserved palace! Beautiful gardens. If you prefer culture and traditions more than just admiring modern buildings and large cities, this is a place for you! center of the Buddhist history of South Korea!"
"They require an extra 5,000 won and you must follow a guided tour. I saw enough for the first 3,000 won."
Awesome to see the change over of the guards at the palace. Was a very special moment of history. thanks
"Great palace, which stole my heart immediately. Contrary to Gyeongbokgung which is flooded with people, Changeokgung didn't have as many visitors when I visited it. Unforgettable experience with the ability to look inside the palace through windows."
nothing to shout about for this palace. most of the smaller palaces within this palace are cordoned off from public.
"Large area with many buildings, our guide was excellent in describing what the various buildings and areas were used for."
"I have brought my family to Japan, Indonesia and Thailand... This palace is average and nothing fancy. My kids loved the changing of the guards ceremony, we went at I think 4pm. Nothing fancy..."
"I watched the ceremony, it's so cool! The place is beautiful and so intriguing to see the ceremony performance of the magistrate people and soldiers wearing traditional costumes of the olden days."
Visited in the winter and it was a pleasure... It must be absolutely amazing in the spring and summer.
"Our walking tour of the secret garden in 昌德宫 was really enjoyable. We registered on-line to get the 10.00am slot. The weather was fantastic because it had been raining the day before. Besides the Autumn colors of the tress, our well experience tour guide told us stories and history of those traditional buildings. Our stay in insadong also gave us great convenience we can just take a 15 minutes healthy morning walk to the ticketing office of the Palace and the secret garden."
"After Gyeonbokgung, this is considered the second most important palace from the Joseon Dynasty. If you are here, be sure to line up in the morning and also get the Secret Garden tour which is a timed ticket and can be purchased at the counter or the ticket vending machine."
"I visited on a public holiday and admission was free (!) which was a nice surprise, considering there are not many things that are free in this world. The changing of the guards was mind blowing. The Seoul Tourism Board tries hard to give tourists what they want in order to boost this revenue stream."
We went as part of half day tour of Seoul. The changing of the guard was a spectacle and all the people in traditional dress was something to behold. Our guide Jenifer was a very friendly person with good knowledge of the attractions we visited. Well worth a visit
"今年秋天終於排上日程，剛好可以參加古宮的夜間導覽。
＊注意!外國人只有周日場次。我提前一個月上網買票，因為聽說很熱門，有時可能搶不到票。
前些年已經去過兩次昌德宮，但這是第一次夜間參觀，氣氛格外不同，安靜、神秘、美好。英文導覽員的英文很好，說得不多，但很清楚。記得一定要早點報到，因為是所有隊伍一齊在門外集合，等門開了才會魚貫進入。(自己腦補: 等待的時候有點像古代朝臣在宮門外等候上朝的那種感覺^^)
其實夜間能看到的古蹟特色比較少，畢竟天色已暗。但另有一股韻味(不透露太多，才能好好體會)。雖然收費較高，但包含一場很不錯的國樂與舞蹈等表演，還有小小點心盒。
*注意: 入秋後首爾日夜溫差大，整場tour都在戶外，若當天剛好遇上低溫冷鋒之類的，建議帽子、圍巾、手套都戴上。
*景福宮也有夜間參訪，買票時記得看清楚是景福宮(星光紀行)還是昌德宮(月光紀行)。兩者內容稍有不同，票價與時間長短也有差異。
I visited this palace twice before during daytime. This was my first Moonlight Tour to this ancient palace. It provided a different feel when walking in the quiet night. Open your ears and eyes, for there's music and performance.
* This tour is only offered in a limited period ever spring and autumn. For foreigners, only Sunday nights are available, so plan your tour ahead if you're interested.
* If you want to really see the beauty of architecture, visit during daytime -- it's really dark during this Moonlight Tour so you won't be able to see much palace features.
* They would give you an earphone guide-set and a lantern to light your way. The English guide spoke good English.
Note: The more famous palace -Gyeongbokgung- has a nighttime tour too, called Starlight Tour. There's some difference in the content of these two tours.
In sum, this Tour is totally worthwhile, and it provides a unique experience. Keep warm, though, for temperatures could drop suddenly in spring/autumn nights in Seoul. Arrive early to check-in -- all visitors would lineup and wait for the gate to open and enter all-together. You can purchase online beforehand. The tickets could sometimes be sold out since this is a popular tour."
Arrive early to buy tickets (or buy on-line) and catch the English Tour (other languages are available at different times). Be sure to also buy tickets for the Secret Garden extension.
One of the best place to visit in Seoul whilst you are in South Korea. Visiting this Changdeokgung Palace gives you a nostalgic taste and sights of how Korean Palace in the past looks like with the special carvings on the layers of roof tops. Wonderful place to enjoy South Korea
"I visit during peak autumn and bought a secret garden entrance ticket..to my expectation, its was worth the money! the scenery was extremely stunning! you can see the leaves from green, yellow, red and dark red scattered around the palace and the architecture is also gorgeous!"
"The history of this place is incredible. It is massive and we had a wonderful English language tour that gave us some extensive information on how the royals lived over the centuries. It is hard to believe that the palace was occupied until only 30 years ago. The palace is well worth a visit and I encourage anyone visiting to take the time to join a tour to really learn how the Joseon lived.

The grounds were glorious in the autumn."
"Seoul has a few royal palaces. Changdeokgung was in use far into the 20th century. The thing with these palaces is; once you have seen one, you have pretty much seen them all. When you visit Seoul for the first time I certainly wouldn’t recommend to go see all palaces. One, two max, is more than enough.
Changdeokgung is perfect for a quiet stroll on a lazy Sunday afternoon. From the back gate you can walk straight into Changgyeonggung palace. These two palaces are a haven of peace in busy Seoul. Enjoy."
This place was really cool - but would have appreciated it more if there were less people around! It was nice seeing an actual palace and the place was really huge! We only stayed here less than an hour because we had to return our hanboks. When you visit here it would be better if you have at least 2 hours so you can explore and enjoy the entire area! Also it would be a lot better to plan coming here not on a peak season like summer to avoid the crowd!
"Wonderful palace with much to see and do, and with a multitude of photo opportunities. Beautifully kept grounds."
I think palaces at South Korea are just average. We wanted to go to the secret garden but didn’t know you have to buy the tickets no later than 20 mins before the tour starts. There’s also no food & I was starving.
"You need to go with the free guided tour they provided, otherwise I don’t think you will enjoy it that much. The structure looks practically the same and there are so many small doors leading to small streets that you may get lost in it. But I like this one better than the gyeongbokgung, maybe because not so many people visiting it so not that crowded, you can really enjoy the scenery and imagine how the life’s like there when it’s still used by the royal family."
"This palace is highly recommended to visit in Korea. However, my family and I found nothing special about the visit since all structures look alike and tourists cannot go inside the palace except hanging around the areas outside."
"Feel the uniqueness of beauty in Korea that does not seek glamor.
Did you ever know the greatness of the Republic of Korea, which has never invaded other nations and has maintained a single nation for more than 5,000 years, despite constant foreign invasions?"
A group of eight from young old to elderly having fun in admiring the spacious and tranquil palace. As we didn't have enough time so we missed the famous Secret Garden. However we love the architectural structure and the special atmosphere.
"This is one of ""similar"" places in Seoul. There are five or six places where the previous emperors have lived. Not a big difference, but the colors are a little bit different and the locations are different. Take a guided tour if possible and you'll learn more. Seniors get some discount, but you need to keep the passports with you to show your age."
I would suggest to go as tour then you will understand the historical value at the back of it. You will know how and why the palace is designed in certain way...Understand how people see the time in the old days... where is the king seated..
my mother and i visited the secret garden in autumn and it was really beautiful. i would recommend a short stroll along the palace before spending more time in the secret garden. please take note that you have to buy another ticket to enter the secret garden!
It snowed the day we went and it went on quite heavily the whole morning. Secret Garden of Changdeokgung was completely covered in snow. It was a beautiful sight though VERY COLD. Our tour guide was wonderful and patient in explaining the gardens and architecture. Completely worth the visit. Especially the snowy landscapes!
"I have not seen the palace during other seasons but I prefer to see it during spring or fall.

There is a certain charm to the place and gives you an insight on how the kings and the princesses lived their lives centuries ago.

There are rentals availble where you can wear costume which will seal your visit.

Tells a lot about Korea and its heritage."
"I can only imagine just how large the grounds are until you visit the location. But what we enjoyed the most was the Secret Garden tour. The guide was very knowledgeable about the palace and garden. Because of the time of year that we were there, all of trees had lost most of their leaves and the ponds were partially frozen over. All in all, a worth while event if you are in Seoul."
This historic Palace is a must see. You feel like you are being transported back in time. The changing of the guard ceremony is not to be missed!
I went with my family We toured the beautiful Palace and enjoyed the grounds and the Authenticity of the Palace
"Changdeokgung (昌德宮) was built in 1412 and served as the secondary royal palace after Gyeongbokgung. The palace was burnt to ground in 1592 but then fully restored in 1618. Unlike Gyeongbokgung which was built on a leveled ground, Chandeokgung was built with better landscape design, with more trees and shrubs.

We reached the palace at around 3:15 pm, and spent around 1 hour and a half there. Due to the time constraint, we didn't visit the secret garden. Changdeokgung is smaller compares to Gyeongbokgung, and we are using the same way to go in and and out. Thus we won't miss out any of the hall in the palace.

The entrance fee for an adult is KRW 3000. Secret garden is a part of the palace, but we need to pay extra KRW 5000 to enter the garden (the ticket can be bought only at the entrance). Changdeokgung is near to subway Anguk Station (line 3 exit 3)."
"I and my daughter walk along here, then we go outside from this palace, to rent Korean dress 15000 Won and more for rent 1hr or more. Many beautiful dresses with hat, handbags and ribbons."
"The palace and grounds are both commanding and pleasing to the eye. The secret garden tour was absolutely stunning. It was late November, and there were still leaves on the trees. Gorgeous reds, oranges, golds. Quiet walk with immersive views for contemplation and enjoyment. THE #1 highlight of our visit to Seoul, and there were many."
"Changdeokgung Palace is a large park with many historic building. Looking on line we saw that the secret garden tour was sold out but we were able to purchase tickets when we arrive at the palace. During the fall they allow visitors to tour the secret garden on your own, not with the tour. Great place for photos, many visitors in traditional dress."
Spend the few extra dollars to get the secret garden tour. Our guide Kim was awesome; she was funny and complimented our Korean.
"I like this much better than Gyeongbokgung, especially because of the Secret Garden tour. And I think it's just the right size to walk around and appreciate each structure."
"In autumn, the palace is not as attractive as the best time to go there is late March (Spring time). The main reason for my going there in autumn is to visit firstly this palace and secondly the adjoining Changgyeonggung. From Insa-dong where I usually stay, it is an easy walk to this palace.
If you would like to see these two palaces and Gyeongbokgung nearby, it is recommended that you firstly enter Changdeokgung, thence into Changgyeonggung (through its entrance next to the ticket booth, in front of the Secret Garden) and walk back to the front of Changdeokgung. From there a taxi will take you to Gyeongbokgung in less than 10 minutes (around 3,000 won). I have tried getting a taxi at the far-end exit of Changgyeonggung without success, as the taxi drivers told me to get out (due to wrong traffic directions).
I visited the Secret Garden several times and found it not too hard to buy a ticket (of any language session) from the above-mentioned booth, as I am interested only in the scenery and not in long historical narratives.
In autumn, Changgyeonggung nearby is more attractive. If you look around, there are many beautiful maple trees."
"I concentrated on the Secret Garden. The stroll through it during autumn was really nice. After seeing one compound, they all started to look the same. I would have liked to have seen onsite guides as to what i'm looking at, i.e. living quarters, bedroom, office."
"This is a good place for a walk on the beautiful grounds. Fall time made for nice colors in photos. the buildings are nice, but the real interesting part is the changing of the guard on the top of the hour. it's free and nice to see."
visit this palace to tour the huwon secret garden at an extra 5000W price. The gardens are quiet and beautiful.
"Changdeokgung Palace was my favorite palace visited on my trip to Seoul. I was here later in the day after visiting Gyeongbokgung and it was far less crowded and more peaceful. The scale is much smaller, but prettier I think. Many of the buildings here were open for display, so you can see what the rooms looked like. There are so many buildings and small paths to walk around here, you can get lost. I did not do the private gardens, I will keep that for next time. The entrance price was cheap and this palace was easy to get to. If you don't have time to visit all the palaces, I recommend visiting Changdeokgung Palace."
It is a temple where you mind find some Korean culture inspirations if you have time worth having a look
We came when it was raining the entire day. The palace was beautiful but the rain made it hard to walk because the floor is sand. People come here to see the garden. But you will need to get tickets in advance. It is a separate payment from the entrance fee because it has a separate tour. It's 3000 won but free for children under 6 and seniors 65 above. It's definitely a good place to visit in the fall because of all the trees and probably during the spring.
"UNESCO World Heritage-listed, this palace will make you feel like you are in old Korea. As soon as you step inside, it's as if the madness of modern Seoul has gone - everything is quiet, beautiful, and peaceful. I 100% recommend the guided tours (English ones offered twice a day) as without them it'd be hard to understand the history of the place. Our guide was excellent and we enjoyed listening to her.

The highlight of our visit was by far the Secret Garden. While it says you HAVE to enter with a tour, once you buy your ticket and go in they give you the option of a 'self guided tour' or a 'guided tour' - if you choose the first option you can just walk around on your own, which is what we did. It was beautiful! Nothing like a walk in the park to see real Korea."
"One of those 5 palace in seoul. Beautiful architecture and lots of joseon kingdom history. This palace is full of visitors and tourist. If given a chance, secret garden tour is a must to visit where it was once a secret recreation place for the royalty. Beautiful and full of red leaves in autumn season."
"When you visit Changdeokgung Palace and find yourself surrounded by its gardens, its structures, and the people dressed in Hanbok, that is exactly how you will feel. You can almost imagine what it would be like to be a resident of this palace back in the 1400s.

I would suggest getting to Changdeokgung Palace earlier during the day, so as not to be surrounded by too many tourists and visitors. That way, you can immerse yourself in the calm environment and feel a sense of ease and serenity. It will just be you, the palace, and the few birds singing in the distance."
Beautiful and stunning palace with the autumn leaves! Go with tour guide to the Huwon and learn about the history of the palace. Nice place for a stroll!
"This palace had several entry points. We had to line up a bit for the tickets. There were so many tourists inside. This time, we did not have a guided tour.

The palace was simple but beautiful but it was quite hard to find a quiet spot. The grounds were huge and the trees were beautiful during our autumn visit."
"On a beautiful cool crisp fall afternoon in Seoul, my wife and I visited this palace and we were so glad we did. We’ve always visited Kyungbok Palace but I have not visited this palace and boy were we glad. We followed a Korean guide and he was excellent with so many stories about each of the rooms and rich histories that brought the entire palace to life. It is such a sad place as well as it was where our last King was forced to sign the treaty with Japan early 1900s. Also, when Japan took over Korea, they try to make mockery of our history by making the kings palace a zoo until few the dacades ago Korean government got rid of the zoo and restored the palace to current glory. The story of a king’s love for one of his wife and the house he built for her. The persimmon tree in front of this house was full of grown persimmons that hung from the skinny branches screaming for to be plucked for consumption but we could not. The afternoon was just perfect not only to experience the amazing architecture but to learn about the Korean history as well. I highly recommend to follow a guide for the full experience. Go there and you won’t regret it."
"Very nice place, I had special feelings when i entered in.. like entering an olld film in cinemas and being a part of the athmosphere.. an amazing city.. ı wish to see you again in spring"
We spent a lovely sunny afternoon exploring the Palace and its grounds whilst in Seoul. There were lots of things to see and even though it was bustling with tourists it felt peaceful to walk around.
"We did not take a tour as they were all full when we got there. The buildings and the grounds are very pretty, however, they all do start to look the same if you have no idea what you are looking at. I would recommend waiting to take the guided tour if you can't speak the language so that you can appreciate what you are looking at."
"The architecture is mesmerizing. Even can relate to China and Japan's architectures, still it has its own identity"
"It was created in mid 1300. The secret garden was a place intended to allow royal family members to relax. The venue was used for a wide variety-of entreatment activities, including-archery contests. Te secret garden is about 69% of the entire venue. Beautiful place home of a 350 year old tree...it is place to visit more than once not inly because it will enrich your soul but because the nature is full of wonderful details difficult to capture all at once."
"Walking around the buildings and the grounds is great. After a while, the temples and palaces all start to look alike, but this one is certainly worth a visit."
Seoul is rich in culture and history. You can see this everywhere specially when you visit their different palaces. The artistry and the intricate architecture put into their palaces makes each palace unique. The gardens that is within the confines of each place is very refreshing to think that it's still within the city. The cool climate is not tiring though you have to walk from a somewhat spacious place.
"Since most of the palaces are very similar, this is the one to pick because of its secret garden. You need timed tickets to get in to the secret garden and its mandatory to have a palace tour guide for the garden. It's actually a summer retreat mini village, and there are many charming buildings to explore in the secret garden. The palace buildings are beautiful, always remember to look up at the elaborate painting on the ceilings. You don't need a guide for the palace proper. The raised walkway going in was reserved for the king, while the lower left paved part of the walkway was for the military only, and the lower right paved part of the walkway was for the court ladies only, who numbered about one thousand. We did hire a guide for the day who also took us to Joygesa Buddhist Temple, and we were glad we did. The big aged brass buckets that are near buildings were actually fire extinguishers of the day. They were full of water at all times, holding about 20 gallons. You will be warned endlessly that the secret garden is very physically challenging which I would disagree with. There are hills, but the climb is gradual. I have bad knees and had no trouble with it. This was the second of the palaces built in Seoul, which happened every time the shaman felt bad luck was on the way, so they would build a new palace to escape misfortune. Very beautiful place, and definitely the one to pick if you only have the time or inclination to visit one palace."
"We came here as a recommendation from a local. The Secret Back Garden is a must visit, additional entrance fee. The fall foliage makes the garden so picturesque. Worth a morning visit."
Need to spend a few hours to take it all in. To see how the rulers in every society have lived so much better than everyone else is very telling. Pretty sure I could have be a really good ruler.
"The palace itself is still okay. The gyeongbokgung palace is more grand than this.
But the best part of this palace is the secret garden. I visited during autumn Nov 2019, it was beautiful as it truly shows the colour of autumn. My guide told me that the tickets to secret garden is not easy to get. Even he has to go pretty early to get them.
This is the place we tried on the hanbok. There's 1 hanbok rental shop right across the street over the main gate. Hanbok rental is around 20,000 won and 5,000 won for hairstyles."
"Changdeokgung Palace and the Secret Garden were the highlight of our two week trip to Korea. The buildings, the gardens, everything was so beautiful. The mix of preservation and reconstruction has been done beautifully. We were here for two hours, that was enough time to see all of the secret garden and most of the palace buildings. The secret garden tour is 100% worth the effort to get tickets. We booked online six days in advance. The online booking has a quirk, they don't email you your tickets, instead you need to save them as a pdf, print that out & take it to the ticket office."
this was one of the best places that I ever saw. you can also rent a Korean custom and tour the palace along with the old heritage.
"Would take you a full day to tour around the palace . Really recommend if in South Korea.
Seoul Korea"
I paid 8k won for both the palace entrance and secret garden entrance which comes with guided tour. The garden is a UNESCO heritage sight. Definitely worth a visit... remember to wear comfortable shoes as some parts required going up slopes
"If you are interested to see the autumn leaves in a palace setting, ensure to book the secret garden tour via online which is available one week before the actual date. This palace is not as pack as the Gyeongbukgung & has a nice garden with the autumn colors in place."
"though smaller than its main sister, the Gyeongbok Palace, Changdeok Palace can hold its own. In fact, I'd much prefer Changdeok due to its size (smaller palace ground) but no less beautiful and intricate. It also has Secret Garden palace (you need extra ticket to get in, famed for its beautiful ground and garden). With Changdeok, you got to see buildings and its functionality, its architecture and also history (progression). The colorful walls and ceilings are such a wonder, the neat design of the buildings are a marvel in itself. It's worth a visit for palace, architecture, and historical geek. You can definitely take great pictures in the compound, because there are many great spots to shoot."
"While in Korea or anywhere in Asia, these temples are a great reflection of the past and a window to the future. Simply enjoyable culture found no where else."
"I visited this place last spring but I am still curious about its autumn 🍂 look. I can say that autumn is the best time to visit. It is more relaxing 😎 and refreshing especially to see the foliage of 🌳🌳 🌲 🌲 🍂 🍁 . May be the scenery is more beautiful on the last week of October because the foliage is definitely brighter and more colorful. I went there on the second week of October and some trees started to change and they looked wonderful. You can choose to stay within the group and listen to the tour guide ,but if you like to explore on your own within the area they allowed, you can do it."
We miss out the secret garden but overall is a must visit place. Not bad and have a nice photo session but this is not the best palace in Seoul.
"We found Changdeokgung Palace to be the most picturesque of the palaces, with the various building nestled among tress and gardens.

You can visit the normal palace grounds at anytime, but it is definitely worth pre-planning and make sure you book the secret garden walking tour as well. It's included in the price, but you need to get a separate ticket (either online or there on the day), but spaces for each tour are limited. You'll also need to check what language each tour is in. However, if you miss you chosen language, it would still be worth it just to see the garden."
Couldn’t get over the colours in the palace Secret Garden! October is clearly the month to visit with stunning foliage everywhere. You can also do special self guided tours at the moment so you can explore at your own pace. My favourite palace that we visited!
"The Changdeokgung Palace is a great place to visit, consider purchasing the royal palace pass that includes 4 palaces and the royal shrine for 10,000 (approx $8.80USD).

All palaces have an English brochure at the ticket counter.

This palace was destroyed and rebuilt in 1610, it was the main palace for about 270 years.

Consult your brochure for the times of the Secret garden tour, you can only access the garden through a tour. English, Korean, Chinese and Japanese language tours are available. The garden tour has extensive walking."
"We came here on Sunday and its not pack with people. The palace is huge.. We venture the entire palace only to find out that there is a visiting hours for SECRET GARDEN (another ticket is needed).
We did not visit the SECRET GARDEN which i feel is better due to visiting hours (pls check on the tours for language ie. Japanese , English, Chinese etc)

Must visit place"
The English tour guide was excellent and made the visit so much better. Worth a visit. Wish I had taken time out for the secret garden guided tour too.
"The palace is well maintained, the day we were there it was raining, We also visited Huwon Secret garden. The guide as good but the time given to enjoy the place was short. The tour is about an hour covering 5 different areas in the garden. We will given only 5-10 minutes to walk around and take photos. But the tour is worth t."
"This was the first palace in Seoul we saw due to the Secret garden tour. Tried to reserve online but it was closed; no problem buying tickets at the door though (you can’t visit the garden without a guided tour.) There’s a fair amount of walking and stairs for outdoors (we were fine, ages 23, 58 & 70) and it was the largest palace garden we saw in Seoul and Kyoto. The guide was one of the best English speaking guides we heard over 2 weeks: she allowed ample time for photos but kept us moving along (a lot of ground to cover.)"
Nice place to roam around admire the structural and architectural history of Seoul considering this palace offers some structures being built earlier than the other palaces in the surrounding area. The Secret Garden tour provides more access to different areas and also great views. It's a short hike up and down some small hills but definitely worth the extra fee.
"A place that you must visit in Seoul.
If you like history, this site will satisfy you.
There are so many buildings & courtyards to view that you will be lost in your own world.
The highlight of this historical site however is the Secret Garden appended to the Palace grounds. In fact the area taken up by the Secret Garden is larger that the actual Palace grounds.
There is Nature, History and beauty to behold. The tour takes you on a wonderful walk through the grounds. In autumn, with the red, yellow and orange leaves, it is a unforgettable sight.
Plan for a visit in either Spring or Autumn."
You should visit all the palace. all are special in there own way. Gyeongbokgung is ofcourse the bigest and the one you shoud do for sure when you are in Korea
I love the forrest and the lake beside the palace. It's so fresh and it makes me feel peacefully. That's all of my feeling. The architect of the places are normal and there's only the walls. I dont find any culture things in this.
"There's so much to do and see here as inside there are also entrances to Changyeonggung Palace and the Secret Garden Tour. The architecture of this complex is so outstanding that it was inscribed on the UNESCO World Cultural Heritage List in 1997. Also, I'd highly, highly recommend the Secret Garden Tour, just make sure you get there early enough because there are limited tickets available for each time slot."
"We came early morning to Changdeokgung Palace to make sure we could secure tickets to the Secret Garden and booked both a tour of the palace and the gardens on arrival. The palace is huge, and our guide brough the place to life, explaining each of the different parts of the complex. The buildings themselves are beautiful, but it was for the gardens that we really came. So at the end of the tour we rushed to join our garden tour, where we were shown around the highlights of the gardens. At the end we were left to make our own way back which was great, as it meant we could take time to appreciate the place without the crowds. The gardens in autumn are gorgeous, with the red and amber leaves framing the pagodas and ponds. It is a wonderful place to take photos as long as you manage to avoid the crowds. Worth a trip!"
One hour walk here gives you good refreshment. It is close to the Big convention and shopping center.
Stroll through Changdeokgung Palace and soak in the awesomeness of the place. We wore authentic Korean dresses while strolling through the grounds.
It was quite an interesting place to visit. Watching the change of the guards was exciting for the kids to watch. There is a museum close by to walk to once you are done with the palace.
"Absolutely worth the trip! When you are in the gardens it is hard to believe that you are in one of the largest cities in the world. It is peaceful, serene and relaxing."
"Not much to see.
Buildings from yesterday, almost nothing is original, everything rebuilt in the last years... it is just worthed because what happened arround there... no interest"
"Nice place to stroll and check Korean architecture. You can follow the local guide provided by the palace if you want to understand more.
Many girls rent Korean traditional dresses for selfies here."
"I wanted an English tour of the Secret Garden at 10.30 am. Limited number of tickets, only 50 per tour. Since I found it difficult to book online I went to Anguk station by metro and reached the ticket booth at 8.45 am. They open at 9. Only a few other people were there so I booked the tour and walked around the palace from 9 to 10.15. Loved it. And loved the Secret Garden."
"Changdeokgung palace is the 2nd palace of the Joseon Dynasty, the architecture is not as grand and stately as Gyeongbokgung palace, the main palace.

However, the highlight is the secret garden. Occupying 60% of the entire palace ground, it's lot more than a garden. It has many leafy valleys, trees, ponds, pavilions and buildings. Visitors must join a 1.5 hour guided tour to see the secret garden. It's quite good indeed as we learned some history and heard some stories from our guide."
"I love this place. I learned a lot about their culture. In fact, the scenery inside there is so great."
"It was truly beautiful. For free entry to the palace, rent a hanbok (₩10,000 for 2 hours, ₩20,000 for 4 hours, ₩30,000 for the whole day and an extra ₩5,000 for accesories). The secret garden is a wondrous place. A bit of a walk, but not too difficult (had one guy on crutches in the walking tour). ₩5,000 entry into the secret garden if wearing a hanbok (traditional Korean dress) or ₩10,000 normally. All in all, a splendid venture into the history of South Korea."
"We had a nice guided tour with a good English speaking guide, very interesting history and amazing blue ceramic tile roofing"
Tourist hangout but well worth it when guards make the change. Garden is beautiful. Surrounding area is walkable and City Hall cross over the plaza.
"I really liked Changyeonggung Palace, but then again I liked all of them. Plan some more time to also visit the secret garden that is part of this palace."
The temple is a beautiful place to see in Seoul. Make sure to visit the secret garden. Make a réservation before you go
"Great,
Second visit were more interesting.
If you want to know more about Korean history you shuld visit"
This isn’t the main palace but I believe to be the most scenic of them all. Definite must do is to take the guided tour of the Secret Garden which is the real jewel here. It is an extra 5000 won but it is really beautiful and you gain a good sense of history. They don’t allow access to the garden except for on the tours. The garden is massive and it takes about 90 minutes for the tour.
"I would recommend the secret garden tour, but there’s steep hills and stairs so don’t take the elderly here! Don’t expect lots of flowers but more serene forested areas with native trees which are also nice"
Really beautiful grounds and very tranquil - absolutely recommend the secret garden tour if you are visiting. I was staying in the Insadong area and the palace is easily found on foot from Jongno 3 sam ga metro station
"You need to visit this place and walk around for at least half a day to fully appreciate the grandeur of Korea’s royalty and rich history. Make sure you visit the Secret Garden but plan the timing as you need to join a guided tour. It’s 10,000 Won for the full package and it’s worth it."
With all of the Hanbok traditional clothing rented out to visitors it feels a bit like a time machine ... well except for all the cell phones. One can picture yourself there hundreds of years in the past. Certainly added to the full experience.
I really enjoyed Changdeokgung - it didn't feel as crowded as Gyeongbokgung and the Secret Garden Tour was such a treat! Definitely worth going into if you want a more relaxed atmosphere of exploring how the emperors and empresses lived!
"The grounds of this palace are quite extensive and walking through it on a very hot day proved to be a challenge. For us, it was one of the top things to do - but do pick a coolish day if you can!"
"Changdeokgung Palace is one of the Joseon Dynasty palaces located in Seoul, Korea. While not as large in scale as the main Gyeongbokgung Palace, Changdeokgung boasts its own unique features such as being built with a closer to nature theme in mind.

The buildings here tend to be smaller and closer together, but the main attraction here is the Secret Garden built for royal recreational activities. The Secret Garden is only open for admission via daily tours, so you'll have to book online or ask for the availability (more risky) on the day of your visit.

I enjoyed the visit because the architecture and atmosphere of Changdeokgung is unique and different, with a closer emphasis to nature. The buildings also felt more ""authentic"" and I enjoyed the relative quietness of the area as compared to the busier and larger Gyeongbokgung. The Secret Garden tour also offered a special glimpse into the past lives of Korean royalty.

Changdeokgung is just a short walk away from Changgyeonggung Palace, Jongmyo Shrine and Gyeongbokgung Palace, so if you have the time, be sure to visit them all in a single day.

Would recommend Changdeokgung as the No. 2 Joseon era palace to visit after Gyeongbokgung. Still, the palace is serene and quiet. There is a cafe within the palace grounds as well."
The place is in downtown and we could see the time when they were exchange the guards. The ceremony is very interesting. The place is very nice.
One of the attraction that will be recommended to you when you visit Seoul... A lot of walking and kind of viewing a lot of empty rooms..
"Saw the change of guards. Took about 15 mins. Dont go summer unless u wanna go
Under the heat of sun. Get the gadget that tells u about the place."
After visiting Changdeokgung Palace have a stroll inside Biwon the forbidden garden in the park (check the time as only guided tour are allowed)
"It was nice to see the palace closely and see the area of the king and the queen and how they were separated for work purposes
Our tour guide helped in explains a lot of things around
Nice place to visit

Manal
Oman"
"It is a very nice place and there are also Sakura trees that make the place look even more beautiful. However, you cannot enter the secret garden unless you are with the tour guide and you are not allowed to eat or inside the secret garden."
Loved the secret garden! Calm and quiet place. The tour guide was thoughtful and professional. The history behind the garden was interesting.
"This palace not too big if we compare with gyeongbokgung but this palace is beautifull too.
We came to this palace because this palace near from our hostel. But, unlucky we came when secret garden closed. So we don't have opportunity to explore secret garden."
Great palace to visit. Summer in Seoul is hot mid day so it is a good idea to go as early as possible. Nice place to take photos.
"I went on the Secret Garden tour in Changdeokgung Palace and it was a real disappointment. The gardens themselves were pretty but what could have been done in 30 minutes max was dragged out to 60 minutes with lots of “have 15 minutes to look around” moments. Our guide (CJ I think her name was) could not have been any less interested in taking the tour if she tried. She was sarcastic, moaned about everything from the loudness of the birds to having to carry a parasol, deliberately isolated herself from the group even when she said she’d answer questions, didn’t take us to one of the points on the map and was not enthusiastic at all. Such a shame as what she actually had to say was interesting but it all seemed to be rushed and glossed over. If you are visiting Changdeokgung Palace I would probably take the Palace guided tour and give the Secret Garden a miss."
Its a must go place. Travel guide explained every thing precisely. You can get a good idea about Korean dynasty.
"Of course if you visit Seoul you have to go to the Palace Changdeokgung... the amazing construction will impress you. The colors and the drawing that are there will attract your eye. Seoul is a modern and nice city but these are ""must to visit"" place/"
"Definitely book the private guided tour (if English, they only run on certain days at certain times so go there early enough to secure a spot on the tour). This is the only way to see the secret garden! Tour guides are excellent."
Well kept buildings & provide a sense how the elite lived in Korea. Be prepared to walk as the palace ground is vast.
"This palace isn’t too crowded and the best compared to others. The main attraction is secret garden. You may pay extra to entry the secret garden. You can entry secret garden only if you join the tour that are provided in this palace. You may book the tour one befoe, online thru changdeokgung’s website. Better you book the tour since there are only 100 people to be allowed join the tour every 2 hours (check the timetable on website)."
"Nice architecture, but too traditional bulding, nothing very interesting. Quite big area, and important to Koreans"
"So I visited all the palaces and shrines that are included in the pass you can buy for a slight discount (you can get it at any of them at the entrance gate). if you are limited on time this is the best one to visit. There is another palace right next to it but it is a separate entrance fee so you can easily hit up two of them. The additional charge for the secret garden is worth it, especially if you go in the summer to get some shade! It is located in an area that has lots of other sites as well."
"Not to big, but a nice park for a morning walk to see traditional Korean architecture and to learn some history. Less crowded than the Gyeongbokgung Palace and it is great with combination to visit the Bukchon area.
If you rent a Hanbok, you get the entrance for free. Be prepared to meet a lot of girls in traditional clothes, especially in the weekends
You have to pay extra to visit the Secret garden."
Well restored palace structures and a real sense of history palpable throughout the grounds of the site. Wife and daughter rented Hanboks nearby and toured the area while being photographed. Highly recommended destination for all travelers while in country.
"The style of Korean Palace architecture and beautifully painted exteriors really appears to me and this one was my favorite of those I visited. I especially liked the ""secret garden"" acessed by paying an additional fee and waiting to the appointed time to be led through by a guide. Despite the crowd herded through this way the extensive gardens, pavilions, lakes and so on were beautiful and worth the extra time and expense. It is very hilly with lots of steps so you may want to think twice is you have physical limitations."
"Entrance to the Changdeokgung Palace costed 3000 wons, but the Secret Garden could only be admitted by joining a 5,000 won tour at the entrance. Tourists are only allowed to tour the garden with the Guide.

We visited in July and joined a Chinese tour at 12:30pm. The Garden is not big and with just a few buildings/attractions inside, many of which did not allow entry. The tour can be completed within 30 minutes. However, the guide prolonged the tour to more than one hour. It was very hot on a summer day with lots of mosiquitos, and no fun to stand in front of a lily pond for 20 minutes listening to the guide chatting with tourists on topics unrelated to the palace or the garden. In fact, relevant historical information provided was minimal. The tour ended up being a boring torture and I would advise skipping it."
Worth having a look at. Not a lot to see. You can buy a ticket which allows you entrance to all the palaces here. The main attraction is the secret garden. Not really what I would call a garden but a walk through a forest with a guide which was quite interesting.
"The palace is somewhat small, as the building are all rebuilt to resembles the original structure, looks too good order to be a 600 year old historical site. However, it’s a good mock up to know the history of Korea. A small palace, not really too much to see. King’s life looks boring."
A smaller Palace and a quiet one; not too crowded. The Secret Gardens of this Palace is the main attraction and are not to be missed out. The tour to the Secret Garden is a conducted by a Palace tour guide and these start on specific timings (please check at the ticket counter)
It is a great experience walking and experiencing this palace where it used to be the house and quarters of the kings and queens in the korean history. GREAT PLACE TO BE!
"We spent a very enjoyable morning at the palace and the hidden gardent on two guided tours. The gardens were especially nice and the guide who led the tour was exceptionally good. Be prepared to walk (about 2-3 mi) on hilly terrain if you tour the garden. The only downside of the tour was the relentless rain, which was quite heavy at times. If you visit the site at the beginning of the rainy season, bring rain gear."
It's really enjoyable trip into the garden shown from ancient view in peaceful & joyful moment together with my lovely family~~. Beautiful sunshine made a tremendous view over the pond reflecting the shining particles from the surface made us feel like in the paradise~~.Be there & walk in slow while you're feeling the inner peace in this beautiful garden.
"Great atmosphere. Nice canteen, museum well displayed and plenty of photo opportunities with locals strolling around in traditional clothes."
"One of 4 palaces in Seoul and I would say in terms of scale the most magnificent one. However, all of the buildings are either closed or empty inside. Are the ancient Koreans sitting around in an empty room all the time? I'm not sure, but the experience could of been greatly enhanced if the buildings actually have things in it for people to get a glimpse of life of ancient Korean royalty.

Finally, the main palace within this palace the front door that you can see the emperor's throne was blocked off for ""Korean language tour only"". So if you're a foreigner you're NOT allowed to get the best view to see inside the palace. The only reason this is a 4 star and not a 5 star."
We love the beauty of all palaces. Hanbok costume brought us back in times. Beautiful set up & we had so much fun there.
"entrance fee: 3,000 won for entering Changdeokgung Palace (free if dress up in Hanbok); another 5,000 won for entering Secret Garden, booking may be required.

No regret if you cannot enter the Secret Garden due to full booking in summer. Landscape and scenery are nothing special there. It was very humid in July when I went there. But I believe its scenery would be very beautiful when maples blossom in fall.

In general, the buildings of Changdeokgung Palace outside Secret Garden are much better than those in Gyeongbokgung Palace."
Definitely worth going to see. The whole complex is great. I would recommend visiting if you’re unsure.
"Beautiful attraction right in the middle of the town. Wonderfully kept gardens and ancient buildings. Museum of Contemporary Art is also on site, and the entrance fee for both attractions is very cheap."
"There is a lot here, and there is no way I'd appreciate this place if I just walked up independently. We went on a private guided tour, and it was magnificent. There are a lot of details that we would have missed if we did it on our own. Totally worth the time to see this place."
"Get a local guide to bring you around. There are volunteer guides. They can tell you the customs, the features of the buildings and the stories of those who lived there."
"Spent upwards of an hour here with local guide. Should have cut it to 30 mins and made additional stops. Interesting, but not compelling stop."
Make sure you see the secret garden tour when you are there. It really made the experience worth it.
"Interesting contrast to the more linear layout of the Gyeongbokgung Palace, with buildings following the gradient of the land. Plan an additional 90mins for the guided tour of the Secret Garden (additional entry fee, check tour times). Easy walk between Gyeongbokgung and Changdeokgung Palaces (can detour via Insadong shopping precinct) means both can be visited on same day."
Beautiful ancient architectures and gardens. This will make you think how those people 600 years ago then were so intelligent even without the technologies we have today. Remember to take lots of photos with such beautiful scenery. You will not fail to notice lots of beautiful trees and hundreds of years old Chinese junipers.
"We went to see the secret garden English tour which took about 90 minuets. There were about 50 people together. A guide was explaining about each spots in the garden and it was very interesting!! It was such a bloody hot day so it’s better to bring some water with you if you visit in summer!! The garden paths are up and down, so it’s better to wear comfortable shoes!!(spots shoes are better)"
"Nice place to visit once but not more. If you wear a Korean traditional costume “Hanbok”, the entrance is free ! Otherwise it will cost you 3000/person"
"My mother and I did a secret garden tool of the palace. It was not that great.

The tour was in Chinese since my mother only speaks chinese. It was a free tour offered by the park. The group was about 30 people with some family with young children and seniors.

The tourist guide was not good at all. Her Chinese was not clear, so most of the time we could not understand her. The garden itself is also not what we expected. It's not a botanic garden with flowers and plants, rather it's a big wooded area with natural trees on hills up and down. There were few residence halls here and there. So really not much to see.
The guide walked very fast and never bother to check on anybody. It was like a hiking trip with climbing up and downs. The last draw was that the guide lead the group to an almost vertical up stairs in the bushes and just went up without asking anybody if they could do it. I would not risk my mother breakkng her leg gojng up there. So, with some other families with young children we had to look around to find another way out. It was totally unprofessional!
We went to see other parts of the palace and didn't find the impressive. All the big halls have tall stairs to climb, so not easy for elderly.

I don't recommend the secret garden tool. Especially if you are not fit for hiking."
It was really cold the day we went but it was worth it. Would like to go back in the spring season to see The Secret Garden again. A must see if you like history and seeing such a peaceful place among all those skyscrapers.
We went June 2018. Got the tickets for the secret garden tour the same day. Highly recommend the secret garden tour. It's the prettiest area. The landscaping is very pretty. Took us about 4 hours to tour the palace. Much longer than I anticipated. Many tourists dressed in hanbok. Wear comfortable shoes because the palace is huge and lots of walking. Pack a water bottle because it's hot.
"This royal complex including the palace and surroundings definitely worths a visit. It is representative of korean imperial period, but it is much smaller and simpler than their chinese counterparts."
A beautiful peaceful place in the center of the city. I recommend buying the integrated palace ticket as it offers great saving
"This was a great place to tour in and around, and I found that I could learn a great deal about Korean history as a result.It was a day of perfect weather with rippling cerulean blue skies outside and that just added to the ambience."
Clean and gorgeous. We did the secret garden tour here as there is no other way to explore the gardens
"small palace , not much things to see when compare to
China Palace. not worth to go as need to pay entrance fees."
"You should try the traditional cloth and you will find next to this palace many rental cloth shop, you can rental and wear it and have lovely picture in side the palace( your inter will be free of charge if you wear the traditional cloth)"
"For history lovers ,what can be better than visiting a palace dating back to about 800 years ago? The area is wide and so many houses and rooms are located in this area.you had better to study some of it's history if you want to visit without a tour leader."
"It is pretty empty but just have an idea of Korean royalty living style way back when. Beautiful timber and was popular for wedding photos.
Entrance fees was cheap too."
"This is my college roommate's favorite palace, so this is the sole palace I visited. I especially loved watching the girls, mostly, in traditional hanbok taking selfies and photo shoots. I was able to witness the changing of the guard, and partook in the tea and traditional sweets in the Sujong room. Admittedly the tea and sweets were approximately $25, and I didn't get my money's worth, but it's for the experience and I have no regrets. The grounds were gorgeous and went on and on. There were musicians playing in the background and I couldn't resist take part of getting my photo taken in a hanbok on a regal throne as it was free for tourists."
"Went on a guided tour here and I felt it helps to better understand and enjoy the sights in Changdeokgung. It was less crowded than Gyeongbokgung when I was there. Nice to put on hanbok and take colourful photos! (By the way, admission was free since we wore hanbok!)"
"It was easy to travel too by tube/metro and easy to find. The entrance fee was very reasonable and and although busy it was far from crowded (un-like some attractions in Japan). There was only a small cafe/refreshments area, especially relevant for us as it was a bright hot day.
There are so many photo opportunities, any amateur photographer will be more than satisfied."
"Smack in the middle of Seoul, this oasis makes you feel like you are far away from the hustle and bustle of the city. The palaces are very well preserved and the gardens are just beautiful. Every day at 3:00 and 4:30 pm there is a tour of the Secret Garden which you cannot enter on your own. We did the tour and you get to see a big area of the complex otherwise not accessible to visitors. It's free of charge if you buy the booklet with access to this palace and Gyeongbokgung."
Its history in the middle of the city. Nice place to walk around and its a really big place. The weather was good. Watched the changing of guards at 2pm and it was a nice thing to see.
"one of the most impressive and beautifully preserved structures displacing the 1400's architecture in downtown Seoul.. The changing of the guard ceremony is also rich and impressive,"
Must see at least one of the palaces when visiting Seoul. This one is pretty huge. Not too crowded and the audio guide was pretty informative.
Nice palace to spend the afternoon walking around. The buildings have been freshly painted and look gorgeous.
"Came here to have a look at the palace and especially, the guard changing ceremony. Located quite near City Hall metro station. Guard changing at 11am and lasted just a short while before the whole ceremony repeats again. There is a small booth for a quick free hanbok rental that allows you 3 mins to put on for photoshoot. The palace itself is not that big. If you just want to see the guard changing ceremony, just come to the outside of the palace as you do not need entrance ticket for it. Interesting to see the guard changing ceremony though."
"Changdeokgung is conveniently located close to downtown Seoul, just a short walk from Insadong. If you're only going to visit one palace in Seoul, I suggest Gyeongbokgung since there's more to see but Changdeokgung is also a very nice place to escape the hurried athmosphere of the city.

If you're planning to visit the secret garden, make sure to reserve in advance and check the timetable for tours. Admission to the palace is separate and only costs somewhere around 1000 won per person."
"I went later in the day so I missed the last Secret Garden tour gog foreigners, it turns out you're not allowed on your own and in my opinion without the secret garden it's good but not great.

The gift shop had some great items at very low cost!"
"We went for the 10:30am Secret Garden tour on a hot June day. We find the tour a bit slow for our pace. The garden itself was alright. However, we find that the morning/noon sun was quite draining. And there were some uphill and downhill that we need to climb. It might be difficult, if not impossible for people who have mobility problems. The garden itself and the scenery was very nice, but after touring the garden for 1.5 hours, we were not so keen to look at the palace anymore (as we have seen the bigger one the day before). Overall, I would recommend this for those who likes to look at architecture and learn about history. But probably it won't be very interesting for young kids."
"Beautiful, very interesting and so well preserved!
I spent several hours here, despite the severe June heat and humidity and was absolutely fascinated by the history of the palace - highly recomended"
"Wanted to visit gyeongbokgung but it was closed on a tuesday, so we settled for this instead. Free admission if you wear Hanbok. Not as pretty as Gyeongbokgung in my opinion and after awhile every part looks the same. Nevertheless, we still took some pretty photos in our hanbok."
"We went to see this palace built during Joseon dynasty and the palace was a reminder of great design work at that time. You need to go to Anguk station exit 3 and walk about 450 to 500 m, please follow the sign to find this palace"
It’s nice place clean and so peaceful and beautiful garden to walk can be romantic as well many young people’s hangout in weekend and wear Korea customized outfits they look so beautiful too been here many times but still love it
"Visited during autumn. Very memorable.. Didn't expect it to be a small palace but worth taking a stroll and looking at the beautiful autumn leaves and lake.

There is a truck selling red bean cakes outside the palace.. So delicious!"
You can just picture how the royal family lived there. Take a few hours to wonder around and discover all the corners of this beautiful palace. The secret garden is also worth a visit!
"This is a unesco world heritage site, a very huge area where several palaces were built bu kings of the jeoson dynasty."
"I didn't even see the entire palace, because it is enormous. Wear comfortable shoes and be prepared to do a lot of walking.

The architecture is simply a wow, and the restoration work keeps the vibrancy alive. Two things that stood out: the portrait gallery with it's haunting lack of portraits (one can only imagine!), and the wonderful trees they have gone to some pains to keep. The trees alone were worth going to see. (Yeah, I'm weird that way.)"
The palace is nice but in my opinion the Secret Garden is the highlight. Unfortunately you can only visit it as part of tour but it's worth it.
"We walk here from City Hall where we were staying. The main entrance is now opened as I remember that it was under reconstruction then. There were guards doing sentry duties and they attracted much photo session.
I was delighted to be granted free access being a 'Senior Citizen'.
It's the usual visual to see how royalty live in the past. Lots of ground to cover as the site is huge.
Highlight for me is to see a lot of folks wearing traditional Korean costume. And many were foreigners renting and wearing them. I said hello to a group of students from Indonesia dressed in the hanboks. I greet them in Bahasa which surprised them."
"It´s such a beautiful palace with an extraordinary design. You need to walk around in any corner you can, it worth it. Prepare your camera to take some photos, wear sneakers and an umbrella if it is raining."
"It is worth booking ahead to do the secret garden palace tour.

As has been mentioned in other reviews, it’s a relatively hilly landscape so I noticed that older attendees didn’t complete all of the walk.

The palace is large and pretty and the gardens lovely (it was just approaching cherry-blossom season when I visited). It was nice to get some context – the tour itself lasted around 90 minutes and the guide was very good.

The tour comprised a very large group but given the vastness of the gardens, the crowd did not overwhelm.

Afterwards, enjoy a cup of local tea at one of the cafes and take in the surroundings. Lots of people visit fully clad in traditional outfits, so it is worth taking a moment to people watch and appreciate the traditional vibes. (I believe there is a discount for entry / it is free if people dress-up!)"
"The place is great, full of historal lessons. The structure is simply amazing for it's unbelievable architectural design!!! Come on and visit to appreciate the place!!! Thanks for the enthusiastic effort from our tourist GUIDE!!!"
"Was a scorcher the afternoon we went and we really felt the heat and the crowd! Your bus after your bus come to the palace as well as domestic tourists alike. The palace is nice to walk around, would suggest waalking shoes as the paths are cobbled or sandy.

It is quite impressive and still in good condition. Grounds are huge and backs onto the mountains. Very nice."
"This palace boasts a forest garden where pavilions, buildings and resting spaces are all integrated with Korea's forest plants. The garden is only accessed via guided tours, which is understandable in a way, since you don't want visitors picking flowers or dabbling their feet in the pools, but it does take away some of the charm of this garden.
However, even with that caveat, it is still worth visiting as a place of peace, beautiful scenes and great photo opportunities.
Be prepared to walk a long way - in summer hats and water bottles are a must."
"I think if you visit Seoul, you have to go to one of the palaces.
We went on a busy, sunny, weekend and it was very enjoyable. There's lots of places to walk around, and it's much different from the palaces and castles back home.

Rent a hanbok!!! There're loads of places nearby, very reasonably priced, and it makes the whole experience more fun. Also, free entry if you do so.

Whilst here we were approached by people (I want to say high school students?) who asked us to vote on things we liked about Korea. No idea why they were doing this, but it was fun to speak to new people. Also a lot of people taking pictures for each other."
"Ok so you will probably end up at Gyeongbokgung since it's the 'main' palace. But once inside, it's nice, not great. Changdeokgung is without a doubt the better of the two. Most friends and family who come to Korea also agree. It's not symmetric, but it's a lot more peaceful, and there are many hidden spots without people, even on crowded days. The secret garden at the back is worth visiting, but you need to book this at the ticket office and English tours only run several times a day, check their official site for times."
"This was an interesting place to visit, but most important is to get on the guided tour where they walk you through the gardens and explain some of the history and background. This was the best part."
Very quiet place to visit as compare to other palace in the area. Good location to take any photograph
"wear hanbok and take instagramable pictures. Go to Gyeongbukgung first before here. The most beautiful time to see the garden is during the fall when the autumn foliage is at its peak and the leaves have just started to fall. Moreover , there are english and mandarin tours to explain the korea history to us."
"...palace in town
The ambiance is really special
Nice and well maintained garden
Not so big not so small
Perfect place to see the beauties of the Korean Architecture or just relax , go through all the others buildings less crowded"
"We visited this palace on an organised tour. There were no lines, everything was easy to understand. The trees and gardens were amazing. Well worth a visit."
"Although I very much appreciated the chance to see the heritage sites, there is too much concrete re-working for it to feel totally authentic."
The Changdeokgung Palace is very popular in late March/ early April as the cherry blossoms flourish. The most popular spot is in front of the Secret Garden entrance where visitors pose for photos. The palace is easy to go. I usually walk from Insa-dong to the palace within half-an-hour. From the palace one could walk into Changgyeonggung; there is an entrance to it just behind the small Secret Garden ticket office.
"I think if you have done much travelling in Asia this site may not live up to expectations. Yes, the grounds are huge but there isn’t really a lot to see. There are very few building that are open, and most that are aren’t terribly ornate. You walk around and look at the exterior of the building with the doors all closed and all the mini complexes have the same architecture. It becomes rather repetitive. I don’t feel like you need to spend too much exploring every corner of the palace, hit the highlights and move on. The Folk Museum you can access for free is probably the best part, very informative on Korean culture. Keep you ticket stub for re entry to the palace grounds."
"This place is renovated it was built long time ago but had some kind of destruction after couple of wars and they rebuilt it again

You need to have someone with you to explain what is in there otherwise you wouldn't understand what is the area all about"
"After seeing 2 other palaces, this one seemed no different. But it was interesting to see how barren their homes used to be and what counted as luxury hundred years ago."
"Amazing palace with beautiful architecture. Entry was free with the discover Seoul Pass. We had just come from Gyeongbokgung so this place seemed smaller compared to there. The palaces looked similar on the outside but the decorations here were a bit more colourful. This place also has tours to the secret garden, the tickets are extra to the entrance ticket and located near the entrance of the garden. We had just missed the last English one for the day so decided to go to the next place instead."
Korean palaces are quite different and very simple in decorations. The architecture and the design is very scientific.
we came solely for guard changing ceremony but later turn out other activities very intesting. room the area for 3 hours and a worthwhile visit.
"This place has a very huge area and the architecture of the building is stunning. We did not enter the palace area & secret garden as I did not enjoy the weather - it was too cold for me ! But, I will definitely visit again if I have the chance.."
"The palace is nice, less crowded than Gyeongbokgung and a bit smaller, so I liked this one more. But the main reason I came here was the Secret Garden tour and we were not disappointed. The tour itself provides valuable information for those interested in the history of the place. I stayed back for the first few buildings, then decided to explore on my own, since I wanted to get nice pictures without the whole group in them (the tour is limited to 100 people). I would recommend that. You can always go back and catch up with the group, or ask the guide some questions. The gardens are so beautiful, we were lucky with the weather; sunshine and blue sky. It was just amazing and I took a million pictures (see below :-)), a total MUST DO if you love gardens. I would go back and book the tour again, it's so beautiful!"
"Rent a hanbok, dress up and spend a few hours here. Great free museum, good people watching and the changing of the guard is spectacular and happens every couple of hours. A beautiful piece of history. A small fee for the garden section, if you are over 60 show some ID and get in free."
"The real highlight is the secret garden. Do not miss it. So pretty and so worth the tour. In my opinion, far more worth a visit compared to Gyeongbokgung."
"I'm not sure which is which, but this pair of palaces and the Secret Garden almost compare in scope to the Forbidden City in Beijing. What they lack in size and grandeur, they make up for in aesthetics. The palace is lovely and verdant. Buy the Royal Pass for a few extra 1000 Won (a few $) and see the Secret Garden, both palaces, the temple across the street (also a UNESCO heritage site) and spend the day walking the pathways of Korean kings and queens of old."
"Changdeokgung Palace is huge. English is on some signs. Rent audio headphones to move at your own pace - the map tells you which number to punch in. They are due at 5pm so return them before you go on the last Secret Garden tour or ask your guide to call ahead. The beautiful SG tour is up and down several hills. Scholar trees are all different, to represent the variety of academic fields. Some of these trees are hundreds of years old. After a while you forget that just past the wall is a modern city."
"There are many stores around that will rent outfits to complete the adventure and take pictures in this impressive place with an appropriate attire. The Palace is just like any other palace in Asia, which is not bad but not necessarily something to look for if you've been to China and Japan."
"Amazing culture and history. The palaces /temples are amazing. Love to see all the local wearing their traditional clothes to visit the place. If you plan to visit make sure you have a lot of time to explore (like a morning) really worth it and the place is huge, lots of easy walking up and down. Before you get in go direct to tickets office which is to the side from the main entrance to not waste time.It was very easy to reach by metro/subway."
We love it so much. Especially ceremony of guards must to see. This palace have a colourfull nature!
"Two weeks ago we visited this Palace and Secret Garden on a guided tour.
It was a highlight of our holiday.
The tour guide gave us a glimpse of what life would have been like and was well prepared with answers to any questions.
The secret garden does involve a hill climb that is short but not suitable for anyone on crutches or in a wheelchair or with breathing difficulties, however if the guide is informed they will take an alternative route.
A very peaceful and historic place to visit.
Toilets are spread around and places to buy drinks. Very clean."
"This palace is the most beautiful one in Seoul. If you have to pick one among the many palaces in Seoul, pick this one. At best, go in the morning. And it is not so crowded like the Gyeongbokgung. It is also within a walking distance from the Hanok Village."
"One of the palaces in Seoul, the palace is a smaller and more quaint one. It is affordable and can be seen in about an hour and a half in its entirety if not more quickly. If I remember correctly, this palace is located near the East Gate and you can see both rather easily before heading to the Jeongsin Shrine, along the way to the Gyeongbokgung Palace and museums of modern history and folk museums."
"This is much better to take pictures rather than the main palace. The building here has more character and not that many tourists. You have to go here early in the morning to enjoy the place without too much tourists. Btw, I'm just lucky this is walking distance to my accommodation. 😍😍😍"
"I still think their palaces all look a like. Same colors and desgins but of course, there are differences in structures. You can come to this place then enter the Secret Garden tour as well. This is also walking distance from Insadong so if you are around Insadong, you may drop by."
"Take a couple photos from the outside, peer into the dark rooms but many you can't enter. Tour the garden which is just azaleas and ponds. Not much to recommend it as special"
"It was an awesome place, no need to line up and buy a ticket for entrance just pass trough only when you are wearing a Traditional Korean clothes.. hanbok rental clothes gives you entrance to all the palaces for free..except for the changdeokgung secret garden where you have to book it online and wish you’d get a free pass...

Palace offers different location where you can do your photo shoot and see the instructures of the buildings in the sorrounding area and walls you just need to see the beauty behind the camera lenses..

Plus it a 15 minutes walk to the main Palace..and it’s not that crowded like the main palace..."
"i was felt in korean history drama
romantically for couple and family
i amaze with people who using hanbok even its in crowded its still good view for your eye."
Behind the palace lies the 78-acres garden which was originally constructed for the use of the royal family and palace women.
"You can wear Hambok it will be ur free tix to every palace, and make a reservation of the tour especially the Secret Garden!!

不會害羞穿韓服很多宮都免費入場，CP值還不錯👍 記得上網預約秘苑導覽，非常美！宮內景色美就不用多提，四季都有各種風貌，有趣的是很多穿韓服的觀光客，讓這個古蹟增色了不少，有點衝突，但美麗。"
"I happened to be staying down the street from this palace so I walked over there on a Tuesday and happened upon the English seaking tour. I also rented the sudio tour but the live (free) tour was so much better. Given that it was weekday, the group was not huge (30?) and the guide was really great at making sure we all kept up and heard what she told us aboutt he palace, the symbolism and the lives of the Korean royals. Definitely a must-do on a visit to Seoul!"
The building and its furniture are representing the of its time the throne room is great it is a must see
"Walking round the palace is wonderful, although very busy at the weekend. The highlight was the secre5 garden, which has limited tickets on sale each day. Plus you must visit as part of a tour.
Worth getting there early on a weekday to secure your ticket. Almost impossible at the weekend!"
"You can only visit this garden once inside the changdeokgung palace. Even then they only let limited people in each day. We tried to get a ticket on a weekend and they were sold out early. So had to go back during the week, when tickets were a little easier to obtain.
Tours are about 100 people and last 90 mins. You get to visit 5 different places in the garden which are all very picturesque. The guides are knowledgeable but not overbearing. Wonderful opportunities for photos."
"I nearly thought I had to skip the secret garden as I missed the online booking, only fifty slots per time slot per language per day. You can not enter without buying the tour tickets. But I read that they have fifty tickets on sale on that day as well so we went before opening to queue and managed to get tickets. I would advise getting the integrated palace pass as it is more worthwhile for visiting all the palaces and Jongmyo. As long as you take the guided tour it wouldn’t seem like a blur of palaces. Each one had its unique features and place in history.
In spring the flowers are lovely and the architecture layout here I feel is the best of the palaces. It is a lot of walking for old folks to do and a bit of uphill and downhill especially at the last leg of the Huwon tour, so wear good walking shoes. The guide does give breaks at each point though and there is a toilet inside. The cafe and souvenir shop in the palace grounds is really nice do check it out. No food served though."
"this is a must when visiting Seoul. there are several options, single ticket for the palace or palace and secret gardens. The secret gardens can only be visited by guided tour and these seem to be very popular and sell out quickly. There is another entrance to a palace for an additional fee too close to the secret garden entrance. People can access the palace grounds for free if they get dressed up in traditional clothes"
"If you ever visit Korea especially Seoul.
and plan to have a sightseeing their palaces.
you can buy a package for only 10,000 KRW for enter 4 different palaces and you manage to get Secret Garden ticket in changdeokgung palace.
They sell separately for secret garden ticket and palace entrance ticket.
for me its pretty good deal.
I dont have to queue for bought entrance ticket for each palace I want to.
Changdeokgung is massive palace, but maybe not as big as Gyeongbokgung.
But in this palace there is a secret garden that can only be enter in certain time.
and must be guided.
it even got secured by 2 security personel.
I got here only 2 hours before closed.
So I didn't get much around the palace itself.
We straight to secret garden entrace, and thank god the guide wasn't there yet.
after the guide arrived we enter the secret garden.
don't worry the guide was speaking english, also there is a chinese tour for certain time.

the guide told us that Secret Garden can only be enter by the king himself, other people can enter this side of the palace only by king permission.

so its truly a privileges for us to enter this secret garden.
the garden is very much preservative and I can see why you can only enter in certain time and with personal guide.

Its like went inside another world, its not like seoul..
when you enter you can only feel peace.
the air is different, even though the city just right upon you.

I just want to stay there as long as I could.
But I could not because the guide only give us 10-15 minutes spare time for each site we visit.
wear a nice and comfy shoes because the walk can take for 1-1,5 hours.
and there quite few hills.
my friend just went under surgeries last month and can't take the hills very well.
security guard was nice and keeping her a company when we continue our tour.

for me if you visit seoul and have extra time.
do visit this palace and secret garden for certain."
"See this temple at night when the lighting creates a magical display of wonderful landscaping, curving pathways and majestic Korean temples. It is less crowded at night and allows for a dreamy contemplation of the ancient beauty of this place. It was free to enter the Tuesday night I went. I think it is $7 USD at other times but well worth that price."
"It’s my 2nd visit to this UNESCO Heritage sure. It’s the more beautiful of the palaces I have been to in Korea. The architecture and placement of flora & fauna makes it a wonderful place to get pictures and envisioned what it was like living then by the the royals.

The Huwon Tour took 1.5 hrs on top of the 1-2 hrs you need at the palace and go on weekdays when it’s less crowded to ensure you can get tickets for the tour."
I always love historical places with structures basically kept the same through the years. You get the feel of the way things were by walking through the grounds.
"Seoul is famous for its 4 palaces. This is one of those palaces. This palace had been used as a main palace since the Third King in Chosun Dynasty, Tae-Jong departed the main palace, KyungBokgung because he hated to remember killing his own brothers during political changes and to stay there."
"Came there 10 minutes before 11am, and was going to book for the Secret Garden tour (you cant go to that garden without booking), the tour that I wanted to go to was at 11am. But been told that it is already fully booked.
The next booking was like at 2pm, so I couldn’t wait.

I think I personally missed the fun part of this palace"
"Good exercise if you like to walk, traditional show in the afternoon, lots of people dress up Korean clothes."
"I loved this place. I loved how many people, mainly foreigners wore the traditional clothing. I feel it added to the atmosphere.

Was great to see the changing of the guards."
"This is the palace what actually most used.
Not that big as Gyeongbokgung but it well organized.

If you have time, I recommend to take free guided tour first and look around alone.

Need extra time and payment for Huwon. It worth it!!
Some people visit Changdeokgung for Huwon. Must visit!"
"If you are visiting Seoul, Changdeokgung Palace is a MUST! Tip: you can only see the “secret” gardens with a guided tour, offered just outside the garden gates."
beautiful building and charming pictures..must visit for first time visitors. many Koreans with traditional dresses.nice view.
"Most palaces in Seoul look alike. Although lacking the grandeur of Gyeongbokgung, Changdeokgung boasts of being the most recent palace to actually have been used and of having a huge garden (forest, actually) right behind it.

If you only have one palace to visit, I'd recommend Gyeongbokgung -- unless it's in the fall. They say the Secret Garden is the most beautiful during that time.

TIP: Those who wear hanbok can enter the palace free. You can also avail of the Royal Palace Pass for 10,000 won that gives you free entrance to 5 palaces (including the Secret Garden)."
"I went at 10 am and there were not a lot of people. The palace buildings are nice and there are some beautiful details. Some of the trees were blossoming which gave it a more picturesque aura.
When we tried to go to the Secret Garden we realised we can only visit with a tour. So be aware that you may have to wait for the next tour to get in.
The tour took 1h30m. If you are into tours than by all means wait and go. I did and sincerely regretted it. The tour doesn’t give you a lot of useful information and you also are not allowed to walk freely and admire what you want to look at.
I left the palace with mixed feelings."
It’s big place and have to visit too many palace and historical place.. I recommend to visit in morning .. it close at 5
"Go for guided huwon trip if you have ample time. It's very beautiful and tranquil. However, might be challenging for small kids or elderly as it involved quite a bit of walking."
Very huge palace! You can get lost walking around in here but it was so beautiful with lots of history. nice place to take pics!
"Visited Seoul and got advices to visit the old Kings palace.

Magnificent place for details different from one in Beijing with color ( green) and that there is more nature inside.

The best thing was the guard change: it happens .. every day 2 times

I tell you times soon

They follow traditional ceremony that tells loads about local ways.

Times:

Small one: 10:00 and 12:00
Big one 11:00 and 14:00

Cost incide is 3000 won .... but if you wears traditional outfit you can walk in for free.

So better find a shop and dress like local for a day."
"When you're in seoul you have to visit Changdeokgung, a wonderful palace area with parks and a lot of interesting buildings. You will also see several Korean people in traditional dresses, which is very interesting and beautiful."
"Sometimes I feel like the cultural side of Korea is hard to find, everything centered around tourist gimmicks, etc. But this place really feels genuine."
"The palace was very well kept, also very big! Ticket price was very acceptable compared to what i was imagining! Loved the open area and the gardens around it"
Beautiful Royal Palace with impressing gardens and magnificent buildings right in central Seoul near the famous food market
"If you're looking for some souveneirs for for your loved ones & friends,this is a place to consider.You'll find a lot of things here from cute korean items to trendy outfits."
"I thought entrance was free, until i realized we were at a section that was free. Paid KRW6000 per person, but was fascinated by the historic culture and the sheer number of people (tourists) dressed in the Korean traditional clothes.. I've heard its free entrance or something if tourist wears that.. but not 100% sure."
"Had a great time exploring the palace and temples surrounding it. Combo ticket allowed entry to everything, and was good for 3 months for about $10. It was a really nice way to spend my first full day in Korea."
Went to the palace with my girls and friends and we had fun going around the place and take photos. It was not crowded when we got there and we were able to go around the place easily.
"I dont like this place , it wasnt that much intresting to me , all of the palace had same looking and we cant go inside a rooms , dosnt have too much furniture
In all i dont like there only one thing was intresting to me, other tourist wear treditional dress and i liked that"
"Having been to China and Japan this palace is definitely disappointing, And it really is a reproduction. That being said you do have to go. The changing of the guard was interesting and worth seeing."
"In case you have limited time and cannot decide between Gyeongbokgung palace or this one -> I'd clearly recommend this one (Changdeokgung) over the before mentioned.

Reasons: 1. mostly not as crowded
2. Wonderful garden (especially in autumn and spring// In summer more shade then Gyeongbokgung!
3. A bit closer to the part of the city with traditional houses and many neat coffee shops.
4. Closer to Insadong
5. Closer to Jongmyo Shrine
6. Neighbouring Changgyeong palace is worth a visit, too.

In summer there are night tours through the beautifully lit up premises. You need to reserve tickets beforehand!

What you should do at Gyeongbokgung however is to watch the change of the guards. However you would not need to pay any entrance fee to do so.

Enjoy your stay!"
It's one of the top attractions in Seoul. Looks similar to Gyeongbukgung palace. Haven't had a chance to see the secret gardens inside but it was cool looking at all the buildings.
"One of the main palace around Seoul, although almost the same with the Gyeongbukgung, the history to it are totally different. You could get a local tour to explain the histories of the palaces if you fancy history and would like to know the differences, otherwise you could just read from the writings throughout the different section of the palace. We enjoy quiet walk by ourselves and admiring the architecture so we did not engage with one."
"Changdeokgung is the second palace of Joseon dynasty. It was built on 1504, 10 years after the Gyeongbokgung palace. If I choose the one building to see at Changdeokgung is Sunjeongjeon(선정전, 宣政殿), the office building of the king. Only this building has the original blue roof tile(青瓦) which was made on 17th century."
"This is the largest palace in Seoul but less crowded, and much more interesting.
Well preserved, more original buildings, very large with the gardens.
Recommended"
"I totally fell in love with all of those Korean Palaces.

Indeed, when you have a walk there, it is so relaxing, so calm. The nature there is beautiful and the palaces are so well-designed. It’s like entering a new world inside a city."
"We were astounded by the size and the beauty. So colorful and ornate. It's hard to imagine the time and labor that went into creating something so beautiful, especially since it would have all been done by hand."
"Sure it is one of a kind to visit a royal palace, but in Seoul, they all looked the same to me. The layout, architecture, Colour are too similar. But you can visit three of them and spend all the morning till noon time. Palaces are well reserved."
"During out stay in Seoul we had fine yes very cold days, on our last time we experienced a snowfall at Changdeokgung Palace. We didnt get to see the Secret Garden but still was very worthwhile a visit. Its a great historic site, to admire the architecture, and another thing i noted was some of the trees were named which is a nice also, as being winter most were dormant."
"changdeokgung Palace is a World Cultural Heritage site . there is a Huwon, Secret Garden inside this palace which can only be visited during certain hours."
"This place is Calm & Antique and very impressive. Also we saw someone who wearing korean traditional clothes called ""HanBok"". It was very beautiful."
"This palace is a wonderful historic site with lots of see. There are plenty of smaller buildings as well as the large, central palace structures. You can rent traditional Hanbok clothing from nearby shops and wear the traditional garb into the palace for pictures. Prepare for a lot of walking!"
"The guards swapping every hour through the middle of the day is a must watch, its completely free and is a real treat"
"One of the top ""things to do"" in Seoul and we are still wondering why... there were loads of tourists here and yes, you can dress up in traditional clothes for some good photos, but apart from that, it is nothing worth spending more than 30mins on."
It is my favorite palace and has the beautiful secret garden which you can only see on a tour. Recommend!
Looks good and if you come early in the morning you have all the place to yourself. Entrance is 3000w.
A must-see-visit. You'll feel the history by roaming its wide parks and corridors. You can even see the throne room.
Out of the 5 palaces this was the most enjoyable and worth a visit. The secret garden was beautiful and really brought a sense of peace to a busy bustling city. The English your guide was informative with a a sense of humour. This was a highlight.
"The Secret Garden was one of the highlights of my trip to Seoul. Such peaceful and beautiful ponds and gardens were wonderful, even on a freezing February day. The rest of Changdeokgung is majestic, clean, and well-preserved, and not very crowded, even on a free-admission New Year visit."
"We arrived to explore the historic Bukchon area and one of the first places we discovered was Changdeokgung Palace and it's growing queue. We decided to take our place in the queue as in the few minutes we pondered what to do next, the line was growing by the minute. The wait to get tickets was around 30 minutes - which I didn't mind a bit as it was fascinating watching the locals, young and old arrive in their beautiful traditional dress.
The Palace offered lots of history and insight into the culture. Constructed in 1405 as a secondary palace of the Joseon Dynasty and rebuilt in 1610 after being destroyed during the Japanese invasion. It then served as the main palace for 270 years.
The Koreans in traditional dress added to the intrigue.
We paid extra to go into the secret garden and were pleased we had. The autumn colours were beautiful. We didn't do a guided tour due to the next tour not being an English one. We didn't feel we missed out on anything not doing the guided tours, we had a good brochure to guide us around."
"Although smaller than Gyeongbokgung it seemed more authentic (large portions of Gyeongbokgung were destroyed and they are in the process of renovating). Felt that here you could really see how they lived. Glad I went to both, but if I could only go back to one, it would be this one."
"A visit to where Korean kings lived and worked, and get a sense of history. Entrance fee is only 3 usd, free if you are over 60. Better find out the times when they have free English tour guide before coming. Take advantage of that to enjoy the tour better."
"Not quite as grand or beautiful as its neighbor to the west (Gyeongbokgung), this palace nevertheless boasts its own charms and serene architecture. For example, it does offer a bit more history and authenticity as it is quite a bit older than the other palace which was only recently rebuilt. A major part of the palace are the hidden gardens which were closed when we were there. I can imagine how spectacular those would be on a beautiful day and how much they would add to the experience."
"For me this was my favourite palace in Seoul. I also visited the larger Gyengbokgung Palace, which although impressive I feel could not compete with the beautiful secret garden at Changdeokgung. I would definitely recommend doing the secret garden tour, our guide was wonderful and very informative."
"Seoul City Walking Tours will give you a free walking tour (search on Google and reserve)! I highly recommend a tour because had I don't this myself, although incredible, I would have missed A TON! Tour takes 2 hours and gives you a lot of great information about the significance of the architecture and the history. This palace is beautifully maintained. I did not go to the gardens because it was winter and I had something else I wanted to do (can only go into the secret gardens with a guided tour that lasts 70 minutes, check times for when your language is offered before you visit)"
"Interesting place and I was exited to see the palace on my first day of arrival in Seoul , it's more fun to see the ceremony and change of guards"
perfect example of Korean palace architecture. fortunately almost empty during visit. it made me feel peaceful.
"This palace is a must see for anyone who enjoys beauty, architecture, history, nature, or a peaceful afternoon. The Secret Garden tour provides many interesting details about the buildings and surroundings. Meandering around the grounds you see people of all ages and nationalities enjoying the beauty, and photo opportunities."
"This is the village we walk wearing the Hanbok, it was my firts time to wear a Hanbok so I didn’t know there are sizes I just choose the color I want and the designed i want I know its gown so its okay to be long all i know the photo taking is indoor only but when we started walking down along the street crossing the road and going around the village for some orientation and briefing and photo taking, I can’t wven imagine I can wear a gown walking for almost 1 hour in autumn seasom...hahaha and even realized how to go toilette when wearing a gown like that...hmmm...quite interesting!!!!"
Changdeokgung Palace and the Secret Garden are special treasures to see when you visit Korea. We were here during the Lunar New Year so there were many people in traditional dress taking pictures and it made you feel like you had gone back in time. I think even in wintertime when the plants are not in bloom it is still nice to see the palace grounds. Put this site on the top of your list when you come to Seoul.
Went there during Chuseok time and a lot of people came wearing hanbok so it really felt like we traveled back in time. Too bad my friend and I didn't get to rent out one for ourselves. It was during Hanbok Festival when we visited so there were long lines of people waiting to get their handbok in the shops outside the palace. My friend and I didn't want to waste our time lining up so we just went in. The palace's entrance fee is cheap but if you go wearing hanbok the entrance fee would be free. :D
"Grand, massive, beautiful and peaceful. Well preserved. An interesting view into Korean history. Worth a visit."
"Went to see the secret garden.
In winter, at least, there is no garden to see in the sense of plants or landscapes. Rather this is a tour of the private palace buildings that you can't otherwise access. Quite interesting and a good guide, but don't expect beautiful plush interiors that you'd see in British or European palaces - these are external views with a few empty rooms. OK but not a must-do."
"Go! Just go there and see it for yourself! I couldn't take enough pictures of the complex. It's also right next to Changgyeong Palace, so you can hit up both at the same time."
"Wonderfully beautiful in history, tradition and architecture. Many locals opt to rent traditional outfits and come to the Palace to pay their respects. Selfies galore and of course people taking photos of groups and so on. I especially loved the idea that during the week there were many school field trips so the grounds were abundant with young people....and young people love to practice their English on you. Had a ball meeting and conversing with so many locals."
"Well worth a look around, interesting place. I'd suggest include the secret garden as well. Signs are also in English and you can pick up an English leaflet at the entrance. It's a calm place to wander round in the middle of the city madness! There is a coffee shop on site."
I went during December so there was no colorful leaves. It’s still an interesting and peaceful walk. There’s an English tour guide who helps us understand better about the place and culture too.
"We all know that the winter in Korea is harsh and bitter. The temperature outside was minus 17degrees centigrade. Everything is so cold you could barely hold anything.

An intense feeling of numbness permeates my hands while holding my iPhone to take pictures.

The freezing cold did not stop us from visiting the Changdeokgung Palace in Seoul Korea. It is a look of a true Korean beauty.

It was built in 1405 as a Palace of the Joseon Dynasty. It was consisted of so many halls most of which were huge and spacious and were used for the most formal state events, coronation ceremonies and receptions of foreign envoys.

A beautiful secret garden Is situated at the back of the Palace which enhanced the unique architectural structure of the pavilions and was intended as a place for relaxation of the King and his royal family. It was also used as a venue for various activities to include sports competition most notably in archery during those days.

To better appreciate the history of the Palace there is a guided tour in English for a minimal fee. There is also a small fee for admission to the secret garden and the main Palace itself."
Typical palace in Korea. Have similarity with others. Most visited palace. Nice place to know more about Korean culture.
"Went there and we had a guide show us around, she was a student and spoke English and was very informative. The guide was free and she answered many questions."
"Changdeokgung Palace is one of the two largest and most visited palaces in Seoul. They are similar in many ways - well-preserved, beautiful, with extensive grounds and many buildings to explore - but Changdeokgung has much larger grounds, which you can tour if you have a special ticket. When you first arrive, you can buy an entrance ticket to the palace, and at the same time can ask for an entry ticket to the ""Secret Garden."" This allows you entry at a specified time but doesn't cost anything extra. I've gone twice and once they just let us in at that time and we were free to wander at will. The second time, there was an English-speaking tour guide who showed us a few of the most important sights within the garden. It is amazing how quickly you feel immersed in nature, even though you know you are in the center of a bustling city. It is so quiet and serene - just the thing when city life gets too overwhelming. Definitely wear your walking shoes - the paths are smooth and wide, but the garden is very large and hilly so it requires a bit of stamina to see it all. Young children or anyone with limited mobility will find it tough to see the whole thing."
It's like walking in to a period movie seeing all the ancient structures where kings and queens used to live. Korea has an impressive way of preserving their culture and this place really gives you a slice of how ancient Korea was. It was just a bit too cold to explore though during winter as the weather when we were there was at -9 degrees C.
"The place is very huge, the King must be rich back then. You can rent Hanbok & take photo here. Had a nice stroll at the area, remember to take flyer that contains explanation on each of the structure here."
"This historic palace was the seat of power at one time and was built in the 1300's. The pomp and pageant including the changing of the guards to the palace entrance is still maintained. The palace and various royal activity houses and the gardens is spread over a vast area which occupies the central Seoul. The plants and various flora were in full bloom and looked stunning. It was very tiring walking between various buildings and gardens but there were places to rest and eat. To see it properly one would need to spend a full day, but we only had a half day so the visit felt very rushed."
"Aside from palaces, they also have a secret garden. They too offer variety of korean restaurant however, the vietnamese resto was perfect for a hungry stomach."
Great palace and great museum! Easy to get there and walk around. It is also within a short walking distance from the oldest active Buddhist temple in Seoul.
"the palace is quite lovely, and would probably be much nicer in the spring, or summer when plants are in bloom. as for the winter visit, there was a lot of large open space, so the wind was blowing, and the temperature quite low. the buildings themselves are lovely. you cannot enter any of them, you just stand at the top of the steps ( 3-5 steps usually) and look into the buildings. however i did start to watch a movie on the flight home called ""the king's case note"" ( by coincidence) and it was filmed inside the actual buildings of the palace, so i got a really good idea of how the king would have lived, and what it would have looked like many years ago!"
"Not so good for a very cold day as almost everthing is outside. If you have been to the forbidden city in China, this will be a dissappointment."
"As part of our tour package we visited this place. It is a UNESCO World heritage site. I saw the main hall, the king residences, the queen residences and members of the royal families where they have stayed. All buildings are in harmony with the environment surrounding them. Truly a historical site worth coming to visit. Thanks"
I was really unimpressed with the signage out the front to enter to the gardens you need to pay again inside and it is close to the price of the pass for all the palaces. we would have bought that if we had known but this was not indicated on the price lists.
"For me, Changdeokgung is the prettiest palace I went to. I've seen Gyeongbukgung, Deoksugung, and Hwaseong Hanggung. The area is compact and landscape has a lot of beautiful plants. Best season to go would probably be spring and autumn.

Also tried the Secret Garden tour. I takes a bit of physical activity to go through the garden. I was quite a hike. I didn't expect it so we took a longer time touring this place than what we planned."
"Spent a couple hours here in early Jan. it was very cold so make sure to rug up because there is nowhere to go to keep warm. The place is huge and buildings are beautiful. Took a taxi from here to myeongdong and it was very cheap, 4000 w. You could also walk across the road to insadong."
"I'm not usually one for wandering around scenery but I was really happy with the secret garden tour. Granted, the group was quite big 40+ ish people, and the tickets tend to sell out, so pre book or turn up early. Despite it being winter there were still nice photos to be taken.

The little cafe near the secret garden entrances does some deliciously warming thick rice teas.

But the 5 stars especially is because the helpful ticket clerk, instead of just selling me the secret garden and admission for I think 8000W, she checked if I was visiting other palaces, when I said yes, she highly recommended I buy the combined ticket and even asked me to have a good read of the info available before buying. She saved me several thousand Won as the combined ticket was 10,000 Won and I used it to get into 3 palaces, Secret Garden and JongMyo shrine. Really appreciated her thoroughness and helpfulness."
Bigger than i expected. a lot of spot if you wish to have couple / family photo. Recommend to use handbook.
"The Secret Garden Tour was definitely engrossing in the depths of winter, and led by a feisty, very well presented guide with a strong American accent. It's remarkable to think that less than five minutes from the serene atmosphere of this palace, and some of the surrounding streets, that you're confronted with a grim duel carriageway bloated with traffic. I like these contrasts in Seoul."
"We came here on our last day and it was good, smaller than Gyeongbokgung, but still worth visiting. Worth visiting if you are into history and architecture."
This is a smaller palace compared to Gyeongbokgung Palace. It's close to the Bukchon hanok village. It's worth a visit if you are into historical architecture.
"This was OK to see once. It didn't make me want to go out and visit the other 4 palaces afterwards. But you learn a bit about the history and you've gotta visit at least one palace while you're in Seoul. Otherwise, it was a large area with some old buildings (and some re-built ones) that didn't necessarily translate a sense of the importance of the place."
"More serene and beautiful, but less grand compared to Gyeong... palace.
Make your way to the Secret Garden for series of pavilions. It was predictably dry due to the winter season.
Must be a pretty sight in spring, autumn and summer."
I cannot describe this place and also this location by using words but I can say something before go this place. When do you wanna go there you have to consider the day. I mean this place is close at tuesday and also the palace in city hall close at every monday. Have a nice trip!
"Changdeokgung Palace is greater than Jongmyo Royal Shryne, but even more beautiful, bigger and glamorous.
It is right behind the Jongmyo, so it is worthy to go there as well."
What a great little escape in the middle of the city. Very picturesque with colorful scenery. Stop by for a little oasis.
"I have seen places like this on television but I did not really know the scale as to these were built. It was very interesting to see such an ancient place with so much history. Wheh I was there the tour guide told us that there are usually a lot more people visiting the site but for some reason, the Chinese government put a travel ban on SK. All in all a cool place. Make sure to have some comfy shoes as the walkways are a little rough but apparently for good reason, as your tour guide will explain."
"Changdeokgung palace is one of the most beautiful palace complex in Seoul. It s absolutely a must to visit the secret garden if you go there. I would recommend to book in advance the visit through their website as the visit is limited to 70 people, and there are only 3 guided tours in English per day. Recommended season would be fall."
"Visited this palace with two of my friends. There weren't many people when we were there.

The place is interesting, although it is not as large as Gyeongbukgung, it is just as beautiful!"
"Nicely preserved/renovated buildings, impressive from the outside but not too much left inside. While you are free to walk around in the palace grounds, the Secret Garden can only be visited with a guided tour (5000 W, ca 80 mind, 2-3 English language tours per day). Various ponds, landscaped gardens and side buildings. Our guide was knowledgeable and spoke very good English. Recommended tour even in Winter."
Must join the secret garden tour. That will be more worth it. Love the scenery. East to book using their online reservation website.
"UNESCO registered Changdeok Palace as a World Heritage site. This proves so much. Garden tour is given exclusively, but, very easy to make a reservation. And I'm deadly serious, YOU SHOULD GO THERE. Each seasons has different colors and different points of attraction."
"Part of the combination ticket, this palace is also nice to visit and imagine life at its richness during the Joseon period."
"This Palace is one of my favorite things in Seoul so far, It's very big and has so many things to see."
"Changdeokgung Palace is a beautiful heritage from Joseon Dynasty. There is a old, gigantic tree the garden which used to be the area for the kings to rest."
"Changdeokgung is one of my highlights of my week long Seoul trip. Absolutely fabulous!

We were lucky that our hanok host helped us prebook the Secret Garden Tour. I heard tickets are hard to get (especially during Autumn foliage season) and can get sold out as fast as within the first 10min the system is open for booking.

Our guide was entertaining and shared many stories about the royalties, as well as the palace architecture. Now I understand why some of the doors are built so low...

The pace of the tour was relaxing. There were some steps (upslope) towards the end but nothing difficult. I don’t consider myself fit and/or athletic, but I had no problems keeping up with the group. My two little kids managed very well too!

You may want to visit the loo before the tour. There is only one toilet break during the 90min tour. No outside food and drinks allowed. So perhaps a snack before the tour would be a good idea (if you are visiting near lunch time)."
"We paid the first 3000 Korean won for the main entrance admission. We explored a few areas, and found it a bit underwhelming because it kind of looks similar to Gyeongbokgung Palace. We then went on to the next area, the secret garden, where there was an additional fee of 8000 won to enter. I guess it will be kept a secret because we opted not to enter. We were probably ""Palaced out"" after we thoroughly explored Gyeongbokgung Palace."
This palace is my favourite palace between the other 3 palaces. The secret garden is so beautiful and enjoyable to see.
"Many thanks to my friend Soon Nam who suggested a visit to the palace as it was in Seoul city. Its easy to get to the Palace either by bus or taxi...for us tourists :-)) ..
.
I wanted to learn more about Korean people, their history and interaction with other Countries, how Korean culture developed and Korean loyalty and steadfastness.
.
I visited the Palace in mid November 2017 , it was cool with a light breeze .,

Inside the grounds it was quiet and tranquil and we walked through my friend explained what the different buildings were , why they building [wing] was built, for whom and when it was built.
.
We joined an English-speaking guide who guided us through and explained why and when the smaller buildings were built and how the buildings were heated during the cold winters. .. MANY THANKS to the guide.. she did an excellent job of explaining in detail.. her English with an eastern-American accent was easy to understand ..
At a small hill there was a lake and stream that flowed to the lower part and a building where the Imperial family performed annual rituals to honour the planting and harvesting of crops..
.i saw others were dressed in colourful traditional Korean clothing.. later I found out that these were tourists who had rented these.
.
After about three hours I left the park to return to modern Seoul and found a wonderful place nearby to have lunch

on Weekends more people visit the Palace.

A delight to be able to have a glimpse of a long-time-ago Korean palace."
It is a very nice palace to visit. We have also done the secret park - this is the best one to see. I would suggest to visit it before Gyeongbokgung Palace.
This palace is a Unesco world heritage site and is for me a more notable palace in the heart of Seoul. Its big and amazing. The palace's history I think is one of the oldest among the palaces in Seoul. Entrance is free if you are wearing a hanbok.
I liked the places as it symbolizes the Korean culture and Korean civilization. The change of guard ceremony is particularly unique and an experience
"It was a very nice tourist place to visit. They have a secret garden tour that costs extra if you don’t buy the combination ticket. It’s a guided tour that takes about an hour ands half. It’s quite a bit of walking so make sure you’re up for it. Overall, the palace was nice and the grounds were very scenic. For me most of the palaces in Seoul are very similar to each other and that includes this one too."
Changdeokgung should not be missed if you are in the area. Worth to buy the palace package tour as these are next to each other
This place was very beautiful and very big. I feel that visiting this palace alone would already be sufficient versus visiting all 3 top palaces.
"It is huge; you need at least two hours to go through various halls which are related to Joseon Dynasty. The best part of the Palace is its secret garden which preserve its original topography which include several lotus ponds and small stream. Spend some time to walk through the garden. There is English guided tours for Palace buildings at 1015 hrs and 1315 hrs and for Secret Garden at 1030, 1130, 1430 and 1530 hrs. The palace is closed on all Mondays. Opening Hours: 0900-1800 hrs. Entry: Won 3,000; separate ticket for secret garden. Metro: Jongno 3-ga Station (Line 1,3 or 5 Exit 6) OR Anguk Station (Line 3 Exit 3). You can combine this site with Bukchon Hanok Village which is about 15 minutes walk from the palace."
This is by far the most charming palace with its famous Secret Garden. There are English tours and during fall you can tour the secret garden on your own. There are also limited night tours with cultural events.
"If you like watching Korean drama, you should come visit this place. Very easy to go to thru the subway"
This was a backup residence for Korean Royal family. It's well maintained. The change of guests show is interesting. I think that's about all.
"Our destination for today is Changdeokgung Palace. It is better to drop-off at Anguk Station Subway Exit 3, because it is just 5 minutes walk away from the Palace. English guided tour starts at 10:30am.
Also visit Secret Garden when you have time."
Spring and fall is the best season for visiting here. Especially the secret garden is a real hidden gem of seoul. Recommend booking in ad. Otherwise you will have to test ur luck! I waited 30 minutes in line and lucky to buy last tickets for 15:30 in the morning :) but it totally worth my waiting I was touched by my city. So much history in it and such a beautiful garden. It is different style from China and Japan. Focus on nature itself no artificial no frills very natural! It calms my mind!
"Paid 3000 Won to enter, worth every penny, beautiful palace and gardens.
Colourful tree leaves at this time of the year, red, orange, grey and green."
"As far as palace goes, I very much prefer the much grander Gyeongbokgung Palace. But this palace has something that draws you in the moment you step in the secret garden (you have to take a tour for this). My guide is amazing and you can almost imagine the royalties walking the path towards the secret garden for some R&R. The fall colours make the place even more magical than the name suggests, making you wish you have a secret garden of your own too."
I loved this place! The fall colors were fantastic! The garden is very beautiful and you have a view of the city as well. A little shop has nice souvenirs.
"We visited the palace in autumn when the leaves were turning, making the Secret Garden a magical tour. The ginkos and Japanese maples were in full fall color. The buildings are beautiful and the history of the palace and grounds was fascinating."
"This was great, especially with a free guide to explain everything. The secret garden has a guide, In Fact you have to tour with a guide. But the rest of the palace you'll want to schedule a guide.

The secret garden in autumn is stunning!"
I would definitely recommend you dress the part when visiting the palaces around Seoul. It's a great place to check out the history of Korea and immerse yourself in the Korean culture. It's so much fun to dress up with your friends and take pictures. If your going to rent a hanbok (traditional Korean attire) I would plan to do it for more than two hours so you're not restricted especially if you like exploring and taking pictures.
Changdeokgung palace is a beautiful monument in the center of Seoul. I liked the guard change rituals. It is interesting to watch and film.
"The palace as with others in Korea does not have a lot of furniture or artefacts on display, however the palace its self and all the associated building as very interesting from an architectural viewpoint.

Lots of people walking around wearing Hanbok which adds to the atmosphere.

As other people have stated the secret gardens are not to be missed, very well laid out and when we were there last week the trees were in all their Autumn glory with vivid colours on display. (Not suitable for those with limited mobility).

It's a huge complex if you decide to see everything on site including the secret garden and easily takes around two to three hours to enjoy it all.

Would certainly recommend."
"Guides were great and speaking English was not an issue. For military deployed in the South, you MUST take a South Korean Temple tour...don't sit on base the whole time...

I actually visited in 2008 but just got around to update this review."
"This is the smaller of the two principal palaces in Seoul, and unlike its larger twin, this one was restored after being attacked and damaged by the Japanese centuries ago. The temples and courtyards are divided into three distinct areas, all of which had to be traversed before an audience with the King could be granted. The Queen's chambers were separate from the King's, but when trying for children, there was a separate area without any furnishings, for fear of an assassination attempt!"
please do not compare the palace with Indian counterparts. The rooms are spacious but the furniture are not that elegant as found in India. Korean history is depicted and those have an inclination towards history may love it. Place is crowded with both foreign and local sight seers/tourists
A must see for all visitors. I love watching Historical Korean drama so seeing the actual palace in real life is so majestic!
"Changdeokgung Palace was the second royal villa built following the construction of Gyeongbukgung Palace in 1405. It was the principal palace for many kings of the Joseon Dynasty, and is the most well-preserved of the five remaining royal Joseon palaces. The palace grounds are comprised of a public palace area, a royal family residence building, and the rear garden. Known as a place of rest for the kings, the rear garden boasts a gigantic tree that is over 300 years old, a small pond and a pavilion.

"The secret garden is part of the Changdeokgung Palace but it requires a separate ticket to the garden and there is a guide tour with different languages at specific timing. Krw 8000 for both the palace and the garden with the garden costing KRW5000.

We went with the Chinese tour as we were late for the English tour. The guide is knowledgeable and humorous making the tour quite fun. It is great to have the guided tour as we learn the history and hear the stories and also the best spots for photos. After the guided tour, we can wander on our own. It's a beautiful garden and even more so with the lovely autumn Colours. Definitely worth a visit and together with palace I would it higher than Gyeongbokgung if you only have time for one palace visit."
"Beautifully painted buildings (dancheong is the term for the painting) arranged in serene sight lines. Not too miss is the secret garden, a separate ticket is needed. The guided english tour was ok but seemed to be about the same information available on the placards. The gardens layout respects the contours of the hills, with man made intrusions carefully inserted into nature."
Visited in the afternoon and was really enamoured by the splendid pagodas and vast expanse of history right in the midst of the modern city . To top it all that day it was open in the evening also with a concert which really made it a memorable experience!! Definitely worth a visit and do not miss an evening opening if available.
This palace is located as well in Jongno adjacent to Gyeongbokgung - only a few minutes walk away. I love this palace because I feel like it's massive than Gyeongbokgung and is less crowded. It's possibly because there is no ceremony happening unlike the aforementioned.
Tip for visitors - the Secret Garden is the highlight of this palace visit - remember to leave enough time to go from wandering the grounds to where the start of the tour is - takes longer and might not be as straightforward as you think!
We only went for the guided tour around the secret garden (best to book online). We bought the combined ticket at 10000 won which includes entry to all 5 palaces and the secret garden tour. We walked around part of the palace on our own. The palace looked very simple but the gardens were beautiful. There are some steep walks around the secret garden so wear comfortable shoes. The guide stopped for a few minutes at each stop to allow us to rest or take photos.
We spent a very pleasant morning here and wandered around the beautiful secret garden. You wouldn't know you were in a large city it was so peaceful.
"Lovely skyline divided by a historic palace wall. I felt the cultural significance through dance and music. The change of guard, power of love and traditional customs and architecture are all well displayed, Just turn around and the new development are visible indication of enterprise."
"We arrived around 10.15 am on thursday. It was easy to get there by subway. A little walk following the sign, we were asked if we would like to enter and join the secret garden Engligh tour, starting 10.30 am. We were excited to join. The tour guide showed buildings in the secret garden with little tips of the palace."
The most beautiful palace among the 4 main palaces in Seoul. Admission fee is 3000w (building area) and 5000w for secret garden. You have to join guided tour for the secret garden and please take note on the time.
"The palace is simply but the secret garden is very beautiful, good to have a walk. There are stop place for relax and reading book.

Very beautiful in autumn time"
We took a half day tour to Changdeokgung Palace and it was an amazing experience. The guide was great and narrated the Korean history beautifully. The most enchanting experience was the garden tour... lush green garden with lakes and waterfall. Recommend every tourist to visit this place.
"Most reviews I read recommended the secret garden tour and I would agree. You have to get a reservation in advance. They only have 100 spots for each tour and 50 are available for online reservation 6 days ahead at 10am. I went on the site and signed up at exactly 10am. Once I finished I looked back at the site and there were 0 remaining spots so they go quick! Once you arrive you have to show the reservation and actually buy the ticket. If you plan to visit Gyeongbokgung Palace as well, but the Integrated ticket instead and save 1000 or more. The tour is normally 90min long but they are doing a trial and allowing you to just walk on your own. Had I known this I wouldnt have bothered with the english tour and picked a better time. At my own pace I finished in about an hour."
"I loved this palace. The best part was the garden tour. Totally worth the money. Also, one day a month, admission (not including the garden) is free. If I remember right, it is the last Wednesday of the month.

An amazing oasis in the middle of the city!"
Another great palace. It truly is a treat to see. History in this city is amazing going back for thousands of years. All fo the palaces are very impressive. It is a good walk and may experience hills and uneven ground. Make sure you have good shoes.
"This is a unique Korean palace built in harmony with surrounding landscape. To reach the palace, take Line 1, 5 and get down at Jongno 3-ga Station or Line 3 and get down at Jongno 3-ga Station or Anguk station. No smoking, flammables or pets are allowed within the palace grounds.Admission ticket is 3000 won. With extra ticket , you can also get entry to nearby Changgyeonggung Palace. Guided palace tours in English are at 1030 am and 230 pm. The palace is closed on Mondays. Must-see attraction in Seoul"
"We came to explore the secret gardens which were beautiful as the leaves were changing colour. We joined a free English guided tour which was really informative. The guide was full of enthusiasm and gave us lots of history and stories about the garden. He did a Palace tour later in the day so we stayed for that too which was just as good although a little shorter.

It's a beautiful palace, well maintained in nice grounds. The secret garden is the highlight."
"This is a nice stroll and you can see the elaborate colored paintings of the buildings. It is joined with another palace so its easy top walk through both. We booked a secret garden tour online, book well in advance, and it was worth it. The garden is really the most authentic part of the old palace."
"It's a big complex area. They have museum inside the complex. And If you really want to know the story of this palace and how korean lifestyle during the era, hired a tour guide.
You can also walk around this palace using Hanbok traditional korean outfit, I think they are gorgeous."
"If you are going to this palace, make sure you have the Integrated Pass. The Secret Garden is included with the purchase of that pass. The Secret Garden may only be accessed, however, by joining a group tour organized by palace management. Better check on the tour schedules. I didn't bother and got stuck with the Korean tour group. I have zero Korean language background aside from the usual hi, bye, and thanks. So, I couldn't really appreciate any information from the tour as it wasn't in English. Aside from the Secret Gardens, what makes this palace unique is the collection of reconstructed imperial government offices in the grounds. It is a maze in that area. Picture-perfect opportunities also if you have your traditional Korean costume on. Now, if only it wasn't raining heavily when I was there..."
"I visited four of the fives palaces but this to me is the best, even if some buildings are in maintenace period now"
"It is a Unesco World Heritage site. It is very similar to Gyeongbokgung Palace. You only need to go to one of the Palaces. However, the Palace is calm and peaceful."
"They are currently working on opening even more buildings on the palace grounds - it will become a UNESCO World Heritage Site, and rightfully so.
Also enjoyed seeing all the visiting tourists in their rented Korean costume."
Came here to look at the palace late afternoon but ended on the guide tour which was quite interesting..you get to know more history of the palace plus the history of the Kings that ruled the country with its historical times.
I visited this palace with a tour guide in a tour group. This palace is beautiful and certainly worth a visit when you are in Seoul. I took lots of photos with the palace in the background: a picture speaks a thousand words.
"The entire site is a modern rebuild of a palace that once stood on this site. It's a shame, because clearly the original must have been very spectacular. The rebuild is interesting enough, but you cannot enter any of the buildings at all and those that have their doors open (and that's not very many) have little to see inside. It's also very busy with noisy tour groups and school children. Regardless, it's not to be missed. Buy the Royal Palace Pass for W10,000 as it's a BIG saving on the six sites it includes. The Secret Garden is a separate tour, but is actually more interesting than the palace, but you can only visit the garden if you visit the palace too. The Pass package includes both."
This is a must-see if you’re in Seoul. We were lucky to visit during the holiday and got to see a special demonstration as well.
We kept our visit of Changdeokgung Palace rather short since there is not much to see. The buildings are scattered in a rather large area. There are no detailed explanations about the life in the palace and the purpose of the different buildings. The gardens are pretty unkempt. Been there done that. If you're nearby have a look.
A very large palace area within the city was astounding! Its a free entrance if you're dressed up in the traditional Korean outfit (Hanbok rentals are plenty near by). Simply marvelous seeing the architecture. Can get a little crowded and plenty of tourists standing by and sitting on perfect photo ops which can get annoying. But if you have the time its definitely worth it to visit this palace!
"It was good experience to visit the palace (it was free for tourists because it was mid autumn festival) and the secret garden (fee applied with English tour guide). The palace has many entries and it was in in city which was good. The structural of the buildings were in good condition and very details, even there were lots of small allies that unable to enter but did not cut the fun to take selfies and pictures. The secret garden was so exclusive but need abit of walking up and down, after all not too bad because the tour guide was in slow pace allowing guests to walk slowly to see, look around and experience. The structural of those buildings were in good form and able to know how the King relaxed, the views of those big lotus ponds, trees, water and breezes..which was good experience."
It's a nice temple to go to with lots of nice views and different things to see. It's also next to another temple and surrounded by a wooded area making it really pretty. In that same area there is also the secret garden that you can see. Nearby the shopping and not too far from gunbokgung temple as well.
"This was our favorite palace in all of Seoul. The grounds are beautiful and, with the grounds as background, the buildings provide a picture perfect setting."
"Because of Chuseok there was a free entrance to this palace area and many Korean in National dressees. An immense area with palaces. Also a countryside old Korean house setting on one corner, vegetable growing etc."
This place is totally worth visiting! Paid for a ticket to secret garden as well and it was lovely! The garden takes up 2/3 of the palace so you wouldn’t want to miss it!
"this review may not be useful to all as we took the annual night tour which is not open throughout the year - only at specified times. The tour was wonderful, very thorough, our guide spoke excellent english and gave a wonderful historical lesson on the palace. We visited ALOT of the palaces in Seoul, this was by far one our favorites!"
"During our second Seoul vacation, we decided to go to this palace and enter the Secret Garden tour. It is so beautiful inside. It's worth the time."
"We went there last November. Despite the cold, the palace is a must if you have not been to Korean palaces. The Royal garden is also interesting with ponds, pavilion and good landscapeing. I made advance reservations for entrance with English guided tour online. There is a special web site for booking. The guide was informative and friendly. I plan to make another visit there in Spring to see the flowers."
"Very interesting site, much of it purposefully left unrestored. Large site, the tour guide stated the grounds covered 110 acres. Make sure you have comfy shoes and are prepared for a lot of walking. If you take to Secret Garden tour, be prepared for some fairly steep grades. It’s definitely not for mobility challenged individuals. One of the members on the tour dragged around luggage for the entire tour. If you take luggage to the tour, do yourself and others the courtesy of storing your bags in a locker at a subway or rail station before you go here."
"This palace is less crowded than some, is well restored and interesting. But the big attraction is the Secret Garden, which is hardly secret but is a gem. Very hard to remember you are in the heart of downtown Seoul when inside. Don't miss it!"
"This was visited after Gyeongbokgung and it was a contrast with different architectural styles. Their is a ""Secret Garden"" which we did not visit due to lack of time but the overall visit was still very interesting. A definite ""must see"" in Seoul."
"As well as the palace there is the secret garden (the King's hide-away), but this part can only be seen as part of a guided tour (check and reserve on-line), unlike the palace which can accessed any time during opening hours. Ensure you get to see both. The English language guide for the secret garden was very good (almost 90 mins tour). If you have time there is the Changgyeonggung Palace adjacent and reached by an inter-connecting gate."
"We just so happened to catch the free English tour of the palace and were glad we did. Our tour guide was fantastic and it was a pleasure to learn about the history.

We then followed this with a tour of the secret garden. The garden was very nice to see, but not particularly spectacular. You have to have a guided tour and there were a lot of people when we were there which made it a bit tricky to hear, plus we had to keep stopping to wait for everyone to catch up / take photos etc which made it quite a long tour. Overall it was worth it though."
"The highlight for me aside from the rich architecture was the secret garden tour. I actually went back three times on the same day for it because I kept missing the time or the available tickets. They kept telling me I'm late even though I was 30 minutes early. Only thing I muttered was ""But I ran all the way here from the station."" Luckily, I got to be part of the 3pm Huwon tour and it was well worth it.

Changdeokgung is interconnected with another palace known as Changgyeonggung. It is located just beside the entrance for the secret garden tour. It's a small palace unlike the other ones but worth a visit if you're into history."
"A lot of old architecture to see if you appreciate the history, every pillar on roof comes with a FORK alike item that is to prevent bird from nesting around, such a intelligent design since old korea age"
"An UNESCO World Heritage Site, built during the Joseon Dynasty in 1405, Changdeokgung Palace is both a highlight of Seoul and a must on any history lovers itinerary. The gardens are beautiful with mature, think 300 year old, trees. The palace itself is historical and a good look at Korean architecture from that era. I love how the palace compounds blends so well with the surrounding nature. Recommended."
"We had a beautiful morning for our visit to Changdeokgung Palace, all the better to take it in at an unhurried pace. Changdeokgung was originally built as a secondary to the main, Gyeongbokgung Palace, which I have toured on several previous occasions.
The main difference about Changdeokgung Palace is that it was built with the full intention of integrating it into its natural surroundings. So while the buildings may appear strange, they are intended to harmonize with the topography according to ""pungsu principles"". The palace structures are all situated to the south, with the immense ""Secret Garden"" at the rear and to the north.
Although the original buildings of Changdeokgung were destroyed by fire, the reconstruction are said to retain a high degree of authenticity. Anyway you look at it, it's immense and gorgeous!
You do have to hit the timing right to visit the Secret Garden (w/ purchase of a separate ticket), as tour groups go at different times, in different languages.
A charming new tradition we noticed is that many shops nearby the palace offer Hanbok (traditional dress) rental. Many groups of beautiful, young (mostly Japanese, it seemed) women were everywhere in Hanbok & pretty, flower-laced, hair-do's, happily taking selfies. We thought them all quite adorable & a nice addition to the feeling of stepping back into a page in history!"
"This is a palace that was constructed around 1400 during the Joseon Dynasty. The palace has an impressive gate way which is welcoming and peaceful, also provides an insight into Korean architecture. It is an expansive compound with several structures, Kings council hall, residence, Queens residence, government offices, ornate ceilings, secret garden etc. So there is a lot of walking but not much climbing. It gives a glimpse into the Korean history and way of life. One thing that you take way after visiting the palace is iits harmony with nature."
"This place is amazing. The main entrance fee is $3,000W. It is worth it 100%. There is some temples that were under reconstruction but still a good place to visit. It is very easy to get here via subway or bus. Make sure you go early because the later you go the busier it gets."
"We had booked the secret garden tour and it is a must do when visiting this site. The rest of the palace is quite mediocre at best but the secret garden needs to be booked as part of a guided tour available in English, Korean and Chinese. It takes you over 90 minutes for the tour and takes you through gardens of the kings. Be warned though, there are a few sharp inclines and declines and be prepared to walk for a bit. But definitely recommend the secret garden tour."
"A beautiful preserved palace. Authentic and bring you back to the past. We waited for the free English tour. Please check the website for timings. The guided tour helps in understanding more about the palace areas. Easy to manoeuvre around with children.

If you want to visit the secret palace, it's better to reserve a place online first on the website. The secret garden is worth a visit and a very peaceful place. However, there are many steps at certain parts so it may be difficult to move with the elderly and kids in strollers."
"Spent a long day exploring this vast complex great walk and really enjoyed the Museum so much to see, fascinating insight to Korean Culture"
"You can visit here using subway line 3, exit 3 at Anguk station. However as we stayed nearby in Jogna 3, we walked here. As we arrived at almost closing time, we only managed a glimpse of the palace. Entry fees was KRW 3,000. This palace is quite well preserved and has a beautiful garden. Hope to return for a more thorough visit."
"with entrance fee. if you love cultural stuffs, palace, you will appreciate this attraction. best to go 10am to avoid noon time sun :)"
"First of all, palaces in Seoul aren't something spectacular nor in fantastic sceneries. That's not what they pursued in the past. Gates might be the biggest structures. And maybe some temples on mountains or on cliffs will be better for wallpapers. Tourists expecting those might be disappointed after visits. Nevertheless, there are people who have been so impressed on them and Changdeokgung is one of the best.

- location: Locating in a less crowded area and with less reputation than Gyeongbokgung, Changdeokgung is comparatively quieter and more comfortable to take a look. Gwangjang Market, Jongmyo Shrine and Changgyeonggung Palace are near and good for connected package in a single day.

- The true beauty of Korea's palaces is a harmony with surrounding nature. Trees, rocks and even views around are parts of the palace. Sophisticated roofs of buildings are also nice.

- The tour is walking outside and watching. The good weather is very important.

- There aren't many buildings and visitors can't enter inside.

- Guided tours only during weekdays. Free visit on Saturday. I think slow travelers will prefer visiting on Saturday.

- Secret Garden: Called as Huwon(後苑 Backyard Garden) or Biwon(秘院 Secret Garden) in the history. 5,000 won to have a guided tour. This takes about 90 min and there are several buildings and pavilions in the forest. The old tree near the way out shouldn't be missed. Right next to the entrance of Huwon, there's the entrance of the other palace, Changgyeonggung.

- The gift shop has tons of quality gifts comparing to most other folk shops in Seoul. Prices are high as they need to be.

- Events like night specials will be also nice. They have illuminations and great performances."
"I went here because I read about the history of this palace. It's a good place to enjoy the history, plus if you're wearing Korean Traditonal Hanbok, you can get free admission to enter the palace."
"Changdeokgung and Gyeongbokgung are the two palace highlights in our opinion. We timed our visit with the changing of the guard, which is very interestin to watch. The place is not too big or crowded, and the written guides are helpful."
"Beautiful palace with many, many buildings and details. In hindsight I should have taken an English tour so that the use of everything was made clear to me. But nevertheless beautiful area to stroll around and to admire those ancient Korean architects."
Visited here early morning and there wasn't the huge crowds of the other palaces. Whilst here it is worth paying extra for Huwon tour. The palace grounds are also a bit more compact and manageable to walk around. Although still easy to get lost in all the alleys.
"This palace was a great place to see the Chinese remanence on Korean culture! This place is a symbol of Korea's historical culture, but if you look closely, you can see things that were influenced by china."
"Few evenings during the year they offer night events with show and illumination. We were lucky as no information was found about those opening dates on the web.
Have a local find put for you!
Spectacular!"
"It's a good space, and you can tell they work hard to reserve the place. But the painted architecture seem to overly done so the shiny new paint looks too new unlike the charming old walls that look a bit more aged. Would be nice to hear more stories or see more furnishing too ..."
"The palaces was very ornate in detail. Free tour guide provided was very knowledgeable and has excellent command in English. It is definitely better than the more touristy Gyeongbokgung Palace, especially considering its status as World Heritage Site (while Gyeongbokgung is not).
If you have time, you can opt for Secret Garden Tour with an additional cost. I did not do but I heard the secret garden was the ""must-see"" part of Changdeokgung Palace."
"Do not leave Seoul without visiting this Palace that is absolutely the best!
Huge inside l, it was the ancient traditional residence of the king.
If you are lucky (I was there at around 2pm) to find the change if the guard don't miss the show! The best one ever seen with traditional band and guards dressed up with the traditional clothes. Around the Palace are roaming young girls and boys wearing typical costumes, they are very friendly and you can take pics with them.
There is also a nice bar inside serving traditional food and teas.
Visit the museum also it's included in the ticket price."
We had a tour guide which really enhanced the overall experience. Well worth the time and effort to visit.
"This palace is an easy walk form exit 3 of Anguk subway station.
It costs W3000, but the secret garden is W5000 extra. The palace is closed on Mondays.

The main palace is self guided though there are tours in English at 1015 and 1315 daily.

The secret Garden is guided tour only and numbers for each tour are limited. The tour takes about 90 minutes, though there is a leave early opportunity after about 50-60 minutes if you are short of time. English tours take place at 1030, 1130, 1430 and 1530 during early spring to late autumn.

The palace was built in about 1405 and was in use for hundreds of years. The secret garden comprises many valleys and pools and is fascinating though it is not possible to get close to some of the buildings.

The palace alone, without the garden would take 30-60 minutes."
"I go from the back door, facing the Green House - Presidential Palace. Then go through the palaces and go straight to the main gate. That would be a great experience. If you wear a Hanbok, you will be free of ticket"
"I find this place to be more authentic than the one in Gyeongbukgung. Although the architecture is quite the same, the arrangement of the palace which follows the contour of the land makes it unique. The secret garden although limited from time to time is also recommended!"
"Tip: Buy the combined palace tickets to get access to all the palaces and the Jongmyo Shrine. Combined tickets last for a month.

Don't miss this palace, the largest in Seoul and with a Secret Garden to visit - this is more of a parkland than garden which can be booked online up to 6 days in advance for guided tours in English and other languages.
Get off at Anguk station exit 3 and walk along big road, you need to continue walking at the corner of the fences behind which the palace lays as the ticket office is a little further along.
Go mid week for fewer people and better pictures."
"I was really looking forward to visiting Huwon (secret garden), but I found the tour to be stifling. You can only visit Huwon by tour and there are strict rules to stick with your tour group of 40-50 people so you can't explore by yourself and there's always tons of people milling around--definitely makes for a less-than-peaceful experience. Also, Huwon was pretty, but not breathtakingly beautiful--at least not in the summer. All said, I don't think you'd be missing out on too much if you only visited Gyeongbokgung and skipped Changdeokgung."
"You must reserve your spot online at least 24 hours in advance and then pay 8,000 KRW at the ticket booth upon arrival.

The tour lasts about 70 minutes and is worth the commitment. If you love Josean architecture and behind the scenes stories, be sure to visit the palace and sign on for the tour!"
"Easy to get to. Lovely area to walk around. Cheap to get in (3,000 Won) I was surprised to see so many locals dressed up in traditional clothes. You don't need a guide to show you around. Well worth a visit. You only need around an hour to walk around."
"If you're going to select one palace - this is the one.

Many different buildings in this palace area - all with slight differences to suit its purpose.
Definitely do the Secret Garden tour - so much lush greenery and a very scenic/peaceful walk through the garden - I would have loved a study/library in a garden growing up!

Look up the tour times before you arrive to make the most of your trip.
A few cafes and coffee places across the road from the Palace once you're done with your trip."
"Nevertheless, we made the most of the short time we had at this most amazing palace.

Sprawling to say the least, grandiose in an understated way, mesmerizing in that once you try and picture what it must have been like for the hierarchy way back then. Salubrious to the max, opportunities to indulge with your concubines, and so it goes.

If palaces aren't your thing, or you've seen many in the past, you could be forgiven for not going to this palace. However if you've not been to one before, do it. But just make sure you arrive with time up your sleeve so you don't miss out on the Secret Garden.

P.S. It's darn cheap as well."
"This is one of must-see in Seoul, the buildings are great and beautiful. Only shortage is a lack of furniture, all building are just empty, so it is difficult to visualize the ancient life inside. You surely need an audio guide."
"Time out your visit so that you get the guided tour to the Secret Garden. The buildings at the front are nice, but the garden and the guide will give you a better appreciation for the place. We loved the buildings and plants and hills of the garden and our guide was very good."
"One of the '5 Grand Palaces', this should be part of your program to witness the changing of the guard ceremony, and the gardens behind the walls."
"If you have been in Asia a bit like China, Vietnam...you may feel disappointed. The whole complex is rebuilt so not much impression . The good point is the great museum inside"
"I was amazed to have a chance to walk narrow streets of the palace mostly by myself. I was early, but still. The palace has many hidden places and is nicely maintained."
"Another jewel in Korea's crown of superb historical sites. We took our time to enjoy it all and spent enough time in each section. Magnificent collections of Korean antiquities, art and historical pieces. Such beauty!
We were lucky that it was Korean special holiday, and all the locals were visiting dressed in their traditional national outfits. We really got a great opportunity to enjoy and be immersed in Korean culture. I was so happy to have had the opportunity to photograph a group of beautiful and giggly teenage girls dressed in their beautiful national costumes. See photo below. Just lovely!"
"The palace compound is well preserved so it is not too much of a stretch of the imagination to visualise life for the royals and for those living behind the scenes. I got there not long after opening so was able to explore in peace and relative solitude...(before the tour groups)! While you can not enter any of the buildings, it is certainly worth a couple of hours visit. It is also easy to visit Changgyeonggung Palace as you can enter this site from the Changdeokgung Palace grounds."
"We walked very slow here to experience this world heritage Korean palace. It was built early 1400 & the whole place is still in good condition. It is grand, big & every corner and few steps are film killing spot. Every building has its own ancient days function & read the explanations are recommended. This is the place you should really come if you are in Seoul. Please walk slow & experience slowly.
我們走的很慢的在這個世界遺產的韓國歷史上的宮殿，1405年建築的皇宮還維持的很好，很壯觀、很大、每個轉角和走個幾步都很值得拍照，每個建築物在古代都有特定的功能，應該要讀一下建築物的說明；
真的很值得來，也應該慢慢走、細細體會。"
"I read about a Moonlight guided tour of this palace from 8 PM - 10 PM on Sunday nights from June 2017 - November 2017, so I jumped on the opportunity and booked the ticket 3 months in advance of my trip. I was not disappointed - this palace is seriously SO beautiful. Between Gyeonbokgung (the large main palace in Seoul at the city center) and this palace, I MUCH preferred Changdeokgung. The guided tour at night was great, and had an English speaking guide (they offer Korean, English, and Chinese). We went through the palace and learned about the different buildings and architecture. The secret garden is only open to moonlight tour guests and we got to see that too - it was absolutely stunning with the library lit up in the background over the pond. There were traditional musicians throughout the palace as well, playing the traditional flute, and someone was playing a gayageum in the garden. After the actual tour, there was also a cultural performance, where we saw two traditional Korean dances, heard a traditional music performance by a Korean ensemble, and heard one of the traditional Korean stories that are sung by the storyteller. We got to try special tea and foods as well, and got a little gift of 6 gold bookmarks with Changdeokgung's special window architecture on them. Overall, for 32,000 Won (~$30) I would highly recommend that people get tickets to this event, or if not at least go see the palace sometime during the day. I'm not sure what the regular day admission is for the palace, but I'm sure it's less than the moonlight tour. Maybe about 10,000 Won (~$10)? But I'm not totally sure."
The Palace grounds are very beautiful and English Guided Tour fantastic. Learned a lot from this visit.
"its nice to be back in spring time,try to rent thier national dress, as you can rent them for 5t won the entrance of the place is 3t won."
"Good and fun to have a historic tour now and then. There are different themes at certain times of the year. I missed the night tours, so will definitely be back!"
"For a foreigner, it seems quite similar to Gyeongbokgung Palace, except that this one is not overcrowded. That's why I enjoyed this palace. The architecture is very interesting and you can stroll at ease among the buildings.
Very cheap entrance fee (3,000 won/person)."
I recommend doing the English tour starting around 1030 (check) of palace grounds. Need to book for the Secret Garden tour starting after. Gives you a lot of information about this heritage listed palace
Visited this unesco world heritage site after visiting gyeongkokgung palace nearby. They are different and worth visiting both. There is an audio tour you can take as well as a secret garden tour at a certain time each day.
This palace represents the korean people they reallt preserves their culture and tradition even up to this days. Nice palace and very clean probably you may have pictorial of your Prenup.
"One of the most wellknown heritages in South Korea. It's listed in UNESCO.

The area is big. If you wanna enjoy more about this palace, you should go to the secret garden. Because, personally, I feel like the palace layout is quite similiar to other palace.

This place is also safe for children. It's really hot in summer. Make sure you bring umbrella or portable fan with you.

Wearing heels is ok for the palace, but I don't know about the secret garden.

It cost 3000 won for adult. For young children under 7, it's free."
"sitting in the heart of the business district, it is hard to miss this little gem. walkable and within range of so many other things, it is a garden in the middle of the urban sprawl."
"The Changdeokgung Palace is interesting, and a fairly ""walkable"" attraction for most. The rentable ""Audio Tour"" is probably essential, since most signage is limited to name labels, with little if any further explanation of each structure's actual use or purpose. With a couple of exceptions, existing structures are replicas of the originals, almost all of which were destroyed by Japanese invaders in the 1500s. Be aware when planning your sightseeing schedule."
"Located in the city it gave us a relaxed pause from the heat and the busy city-life.

Entrance fee is KRW 3.000 per adult, if you want to see the secret garden they will charge you extra."
"This has to be my favourite part of this trip — Changdeokgung, located east of Gyeongbokgung, was the most favoured palace of the Joseon princes. A UNESCO world heritage site, this palace retained several elements dating from the Three Kingdoms of Korea period and one such element is the fact that the buildings of Changdeokgung blend with the topography of the site. It is significantly less crowded than Gyeongbokgung and it made the palace experience a whole lot sweeter.

Housed at the back of the palace is a 32 hectare rear garden, also known as Huwon — this garden was originally constructed for the royal family and palace women, incorporating a lotus pond, pavilions, landscaped lawns … and a royal library. Entrance into this part of the palace complex, is ticketed and by guided tours only. I enjoyed every bit of my visit to the Secret Garden, with its gorgeous landscape and architecture. The carefully preserved grounds were a sight to behold!

Best to book your tickets online for the guided tours of Huwon to avoid disappointment."
"I recommend ""one day hanbok"" as the place to get your hanbok for both men and women. Wearing hanboks makes all palaces free for you! This palace overall was a good experience and make argue to buy a secret garden pass to see more beautiful scenery"
"You should not miss this place. It shows the style of Korean last dynasty at is splendor.Do not miss the ""Secret garden"": you need to make a reservation in advance and you can choose between English, Japanese and Korean guide: it worth it because the guide gives a lot of information about the way life was in those gone days. I can imagine the garden would be even more beautiful in Autumn or in Spring."
Had a nice day in the palace and it´s well worth it going to the secret garden. Book ahead though as only a limited number of people can go on a tour. Wasn´t difficult to reserve online one day before but check again to be sure.
"We spent a morning here in March. The Palace is lovely, with lots to see and discuss. The building(s) is so vast, expect lots of walking. There were a lot of tourists there so expect to stay a while to get good pictures."
Very well preserved historic palace used by the rulers of the last dynasty in Korea! There are numerous buildings all well maintained as are the grounds! Particularly enjoyed all the young people walking around in costume and having photos taken with them! It's in the middle is Seoul and is a must see when there!
During one of my latest trips to Seoul I visited this palace. A nice historic place in the centre of Seoul. If you like the history of Seoul a must to visit.
"Absolutely breathtaking ,and the gardens are just wonderfull,you do pay xtra to see the gardens as you only allowed to go with a guide ,but the palace grounds are free wander at your leisure."
Love this palace and don't miss the special secret garden. There's someone to walk us through all the lovely and special spots in the secret garden. Enjoyed thoroughly
"Changdeokgung Palace was the second royak villa built in 1405. It is the most preserved of the five remaining royal Joseon palaces. After it's destruction during the Japanese invasion, it was rebuilt in 1610 and served as the main palace for about 270 years. Injeongjeon Hall is the throne, which was used for holding formal state events. Seonjeongjeon Hall is the rulers council hall and the only remaining palace with blue glazed roof tiles. The kings residence is Huijeongdang Hall, while the queen is Daejojeon Hall. Entrance fee to the palace grounds is 3,000 Korean Won. English guided tour is available. Also make sure not to miss the Palace Secret Garden which requires a separate entrance fee. It's a must. You can reach the Palace by Jongno-3 Station Line 1,3 or 5 Exit 6 or Line 3 Anguk Station Exit 3."
I think this Palace is one of the most beautiful places in Soul. You are in the middle of the city but is so peaceful and quiet.
It is a very large area. Apart from the buildings there is not that much to see. The grounds are very serene and well kept.
"One of the bigger complexes and should definitely be put on your Seoul to do list. We didnt go into the secret garden, but we felt there was enough to see without booking the extra ticket and partly because you do have to reserve a place for the secret garden tour."
"We made our way to Changdeokgung Palace in time for the 10:30 am English tour, only to find that the tour actually started at 10:15 am. Oh well, self-guided tour it is.

During summer, the palace is open from 9 am to 6:30 pm. Admission to the Palace only is 3,000 won (2.66 USD) per adult. We bought the Royal Palace Pass for 10,000 won (8.88 USD) each which gives us entry to Changdeokgung, the Secret Garden,Gyeongbokgung Palace, Changgyeonggung Palace, Deoksugung Palace and Jongmyo Shrine (ticket valid for 3 months).

We booked the 11:30 am Secret Garden tour. The garden can only be viewed by guided tour and it is highly recommended that you book this ahead of time. Bookings can be done online here up to 6 days before your desired tour date. Sure enough, our tour was completely full. Our tour guide was excellent and spoke perfect American English.

This tour was well worth doing. The gardens are beautiful. However, keep in mind that some degree of fitness is required; the garden is very hilly with steep inclines/declines and there are many steps at one point. The paths are generally paved and there is anti-slip matting in place on the steeper sections."
"We were here in October when the leaves were just starting to change. We went along with our Korean friend and his girlfriend, and joined the tour (which he said was mandatory), but we got sidetracked taking photos and sort of wandered off from the group (which didn't seem to be a problem). Our friend showed us around the rest of the area and still knew enough to tell us a bit about the palace, so it was all good. We spent awhile walking around the grounds taking pictures and had a nice afternoon here. It's definitely worth checking out, especially if you like visiting palaces and enjoy architecture."
This place is a feast to the eyes even on a summer day with all the lush greens surrounding the palace. Too bad we were in a hurry that we missed the guided tour to the Secret Garden. Oh well..
We went here because we bought the package tickets for all the palaces. I would say that it's worth seeing once.
"If you are only going to see one palace in Seoul, this one should be the one you see. You get the option of adding on the garden tour here, which is a mandatory guided tour lasting 1.5 hours, but there is a lot to see even without the add on. The architecture is the exact same as the other palaces (I presume this even though we only visited Gyeonbokgung - but literally it was the same thing so I can only assume based on pictures that they are all pretty similar). There were some great photo ops here and I like being able to get up close to the buildings to really see the paintings and the structural elements that makes these palaces special."
"The Gyeongbokgung palace has the claim to fame but this palace it the real winner in Seoul. Be sure to partake in the secret garden tour, it only costs a couple of $/€ per person. If you take the tour you will see the most beautiful part of the palace with a knowledgeable, and sometimes funny, guide. There are only 2 tours per day for Westerners. Be sure to stuff yourself at breakfast because you can not bring any food into the complex."
"Magnificent palace with a beautiful, jaw dropping garden! A must visit iconic spot in Seoul. A UNESCO world heritage site. I was trully impressed by the beautiful landscape, pond, intricate designs of the palace itself. A unique experience."
"Changdeokgung Palace, one of the UNESTO World Heritage sites in Seoul, is an elegant palace resided by many Yi Dynasty kings. Unlike other palaces in Seoul, this palace has vast and beautiful nature preserve inside the palace complex. Its peaceful surroundings and elegant palace buildings attract many visitors from all over the world. The palace's Huwon (후원- 後苑-Rear Garden) with attractive lotus pond and pavilions surrounded by serene woodland is especially memorable to the visitors.
At the ticket office in front of the palace, buy the combination ticket for the palace & Huwon (후원- 後苑-Rear Garden). Since the visit to Huwon is by guided tour only with a set time, you can take a look at the posted tour starting time and select the appropriate time for your guided tour of Huwon. Seniors from foreign countries are eligible for half-price admission when a proof of age such as passport or driver's license is presented to the ticket agent at the ticket window.
Once you enter the palace compound by presenting your palace admissions ticket at the entrance, you can wander around the palace ground until your guided tour time to Huwon. Be at the guided tour entrance gate in time not to miss the guided tour. To be on safe side, allow 10~15 minutes for you to go to the guided tour entrance from the first entrance area. Upon entering Huwon through the entrance gate with your Huwon entrance ticket, your guide might allow you to wander around Huwon on your own at your own pace, because Huwon guides tend to walk at fast pace without waiting for slow walkers. At the end of the guided tour, your guide will give you free time to wander around Huwon and exit Huwon on your own. Allow for half a day for the palace/Huwon visit, and wear comfortable walking shoes or sneakers.
On the palace ground, you will come across many young people wearing colorful Korean costume (Hanbok) making you feel as if you have embarked on a time travel to the past. Many of these young people wearing Korean costume (Hanbok) are tourists who are wearing rented costumes, because five major palaces in Seoul waive admission fees to those wearing Korean costume. Note that wearing Korean costume (Hanbok) will allow these visitors free admission to Changdeokgoong but not to Huwon (Rear Garden). Those Hanbok wearers still have to buy the ticket for the guided tour of Huwon (Rear Garden). Hanbok can be rented for a relatively low price from many shops at Eulji-ro Underground Shopping Center, located near Myeong-dong and Jongno."
"This palace rightly is UNESCO classified and worth visiting. I was even more impressed by the entertaining 90 minute guided tour of the Secret Garden. You have to take a scheduled guided tour to visit this area and it is well worth the time if you have it. You don't have to be ""into gardens"" to enjoy the beauty of this historical oasis."
"The Changdeokgung palace is a fascinating place to visit with the architecture and the Secret Garden. I went with a Hanbok I had rented from OneDay Hanbok, so I was able to get in for free (but you still have to pay for the secret garden tour even if you are wearing a Hanbok). There is wifi throughout most of the grounds, and there are a lot of nice places to take lots of pictures, especially if you are wearing a Hanbok. Just make sure to crop out others who aren't wearing Hanbok :)"
"Beautiful palace in the central of Seoul.... peaceful... Good for taking pictures. cheap entrance fees... not much crowded... mostly kids from school... 1 hour is enough to explore...
been to all palace in Seoul... all looks similar... so its better to visit any 2 palace instead of visiting all palaces."
Fascinating palace of the Joseon era. English tour was excellent and very informative as well as free! Highly recommended if you want to learn about the history of Seoul and Korea.
"A really beautiful palace, it was a lot bigger than i expected. Took the free English tour, which was about an hour. The English tour runs more often than published on the webpage. Highly recommended to follow the tour so that you can get a proper history of the palace as the design of the rooms are about the same.

Go for the Huwon tour as well! The garden was really pretty.

Took about 1 hour each, be prepared to do a lot of walking as well as stair climbing."
"Good for a stroll. There was a traditional band near the store and it was a treat to sit down and watch and listen.

However, quite overrun with visitors wearing rented traditional clothes, trying to take photos everywhere. Try to avoid them and you'll be fine."
"Definitely a must-see if you like history, art, or architecture and you are in Seoul. I would definitely recommend a tour guide however because the complex is quite large and there is a lot to know that you will miss out on if no one is there to tell you! You can just hire one for the day and have them explain it to you as you go through the complex and then move on to another site... or at least thats what I did and would recommend that. The Palace itself was wonderful and even though it was considered the ""secondary"" palace, it became the primary palace when the old one was destroyed and it is original. Also, one good thing to know, Gyeongbyokgung palace has a VERY cool changing of the guard ceremony that is free of charge, you just need to find out when the ceremony is. But I wouldn't waste your time going inside. It is just like this palace except it is a restoration because the Japanese destroyed the originals during their occupation."
Beautiful monument in the middle of this incredible modern city. The contrast between the contemporary and ancient is an interesting experience.
Place is big and interesting. You can rent costumes if you want to take pictures using Korean Historic Clothes (10-20 US Dollars)
"This place is so attractive, for me the best Palace still is Gyeongbokgung Palace or Gyeongbok Palace, but this place had a very interesting place, that is The Secret Garden.
We can reach this location easily by subway - stop in Anguk Station, and just walk about 5 minutes, we must paid KRW 3000 to enter The Changdeokgung Palace, and if we want to enter The Secret Garden, we must add KRW 5000.
Their provided a local tour guide, who will lead and give us an explanation for about 1.5 hours tour around The Secret Garden area, depend on we choose which language we want to hear the explanation (they have several choosing time - which different languages, as I know Chinese, Korean, and English)."
This palace is beautiful but do not skip the gardens. The garden is beautiful and peaceful place and you can almost hear and feel the history of Joseon dynasty here.
"Great palace to visit, just one subway stop away from Gyeongbokgung, admission is also free if you are wearing Hanbok. Secret Garden is definitely a must see. We went there in June, but the most beautiful views can be seen in Fall."
"Unimpressive palace that looks like a newly built movie set. The gardens are also boring and lacked imagination. Have seen much better and memorable historical sites at other Asian countries than this. e.g. Japan. If you don't have much time in Seoul, can skip this."
Another one of the palaces that is a must-visit in Seoul. Arrive early if you want to avoid the crowds. Recommend joining in a Secret Garden Tour to make your experience complete.
Wonderful period costumes on the guards and beautiful ceremonial flags. Many Korean Tourists their wearing rented period costumes and adding to the pagentry of the Changing of the Guards.
"Very similar to the G-palace in appearance but still worth a visit. The guided tour of the Secret Garden was filled with more stories and is very picturesque with its water features and pavilions.
Thanks for the vote if you found this review helpful."
See it...see both of the palaces that is next to each other. You can buy the tickets to the other palace Inside the area. There is a guard border between this two palaces and ticket sell is there. You need half a day to just walk around and enjoy the calm
"It's a very nice place if you're interested in history and Korean culture. If you only have time for one palace in Seoul, see this. The surroundings are more close by and in my opinion prettier than Gyeongbokgung, and you must see the Secret garden. Make sure to book a guide to the secret garden online the day before (you can book a ticket the same day at the palace itself but it's a bit risky during peak season). I would recommend getting an audio guide for the palace itself if you don't want to wait for an English guide."
"The palace is beautiful, make sure to go early cause it closes early (about 5:30 pm), also the gardens are a MUST. You're allowed to enter to the gardens also with the guide tour and it costs extra, make sure to check the hours before you go cause we were in the last tour which was in korean and we didn't really understood anything."
"This was the only palace I had time to tour while in Seoul, but I was grateful for the opportunity. There is so much symbolism to the architecture and furnishings that I would have been oblivious to without a guide. Also, learning how the multiple palaces in Seoul relate to each other was a fascinating lesson. This was an impressive visit!"
"The visit to this palace shall include the visit to Secret Garden
(visiting time and numbers of visitor is limited) to watch the beautiful and wonderful King's garden."
"The palace is definitely worth a visit with many beautiful buildings spread across the palace grounds. I mostly enjoyed the Korean teenagers in their traditional clothing posing in front of the palace buildings with selfie sticks in hands.
While at the palace, enter the people culture museum (free entrance) next to the palace."
WE were here during the early morning. Not too crowded. There were numerous buildings throughout the palace. We were just in time for the military ceremony. The colorful costumes of the guards were on display.
"It's good to be emperor-- you get the biggest room! Since you must see the local palace, this is a good one. Make sure you get there in time for the changing of the guard which is colorful but clearly performed for the tourists."
"First this is a UNESCO Heritage site. So one good reason to go. It seats near Angku Station so getting there is not an issue. Take Line 3 to Angku, exit 3 and walk for 500 meters. This is a huge site so do plan time to visit. This sites have two areas and separate entry fee. 3000 won gets you to the palace. Which I feel is good enough. It took me a good 1.5 hours. Overall good to spend some time on."
"Despite an extra fee, you will discover the beauty and the harmony of the secret gardens during an one hour and a half guided tour. Then you can continue to visit the palace."
Beautiful oasis in downtown Seoul. Lovely site of historical interest. Doing some reading about the palace beforehand will make your visit a better experience.
Through Gwanghwamun Gate and wander the impressive scenic grounds and series of palace buildings with many couples and groups of young adults and families in traditional Korean dress. What an experience!! Absolutely sensational Exemplar tourism experience
"There is a separate admission to the gardens, but that is what makes this palace special. We took the English tour of the gardens. We did the palace on our own. The palaces all have their own history but are fairly similar in appearance. This tour is best in nice weather."
"Whilst seeing the palace structures were fascinating, the Secret Garden tour was amazing. I was sceptical as I thought the guide was going to show us just flowers and plants and this tour was scheduled to be 90 minutes which initially worried me. However, the tour and tour guide were superb. There was more to see than flowers and plants and there were so many interesting nuggets of information regarding the structures in the garden. The 90 minutes zipped by."
"worth to see, quite , good to spend time with friends walking around and getting into history. i loved it"
"Less crowded than the main palace Gyeongbokgung, it is the perfect place to take pictures with no one in the background. Went in late May. Also where you can visit the Huwon Secret Garden. Admission to the secret garden is separate from the palace. Tickets are limited so it is advisable to book online."
"If you have seen another Korean palace by now, you are at some point going to say. Oh No more of the same. But the secret garden is just from somewhere else. Plan your day to be in time for the English guided tour and start with this tour. It's about 1.30 to 2 hours. So keep yourself prepared for some walking. You can enter the place only with a guide!! There are bits that are surreal. Depending on the weather and time of the day views can be magnificent with reflections from lakes and ponds and the beautiful old Korean buildings. Not to forget the numerous plants and buildings. We just loved this garden. As for the palace, not bad but hey we had seen the other palace the other day and we liked it but it was like a little bit more of the same. Enjoy!!"
The palace is very beautifully preserved. Every detail has been taken care of. I love the secret garden tour and I would visit this place again.
"I visited this palace using the palace combination ticket, where for 10,000 krw you can visit 4 temples and 1 shrine, it's a great deal. This particular Palace is not as big as the main palace, but still quite a walk to explore the whole thing, definitely take the guided tour to the secret garden, it is well worth it! And it's included in the combination ticket."
"Absolutely beautiful and well-preserved. Ensure that you also buy a ticket to enter the Palace Garden (Hu-won in Korean), which you can only visit through a guided tour. Full of beautiful pavilions, little ponds and stories. I visit Changdeokgung whenever I go back Korea, and each time it mesmerises me with its beauty."
"We went here for the changing of the guards ceremony which was interesting to see, although it was repeated several times, not sure why. I guess if you are running late, you can still catch it. It was running for almost 30 minutes from the time it started. At some point, you can take some pictures with the ""commander"", which was a little cheesy. There's a booth right at the front where you try on the ancient costumes, so we used them to take some pictures in front of the gate."
"We went on 10:30 English tour of secret garden. 90 minutes of walking hilly areas well worth the effort. Then after we went to palace which was self guided, less crowded and more fun on our own.
Found some things not on the tour book such as sun dial."
Classic Korean palace. Very breathing up and historical. Feel like go into Korean history. Worth visiting
This turned out to be a nice green spot near City Hall. It cost about $1 to visit and it took us about 30 minutes to walk around the park.
"the secret garden stuff is amazing and enjoyable, but other than that everything is pretty much the same as gyeongbokgung, cultural palace. i do prefer the gyeongbokgung but the secret garden stuff is worth it.

and also less people wearing hanbok (other alternative to wear hanbok and take a picture of urself)"
"I really enjoyed the Secret Garden Tour even if I was not physically prepared for it. My friends and I didn't know that it will be a hike and the guide was too fast that we can't keep up. But regardless, we still enjoyed it. I liked it because it was a different experience from the usual palace tours I've joined before."
"The place is amazing, the ticket is really cheap and there are some guided tours (that take more than an hour) in english and I think also other languages. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT!
Be careful, it is CLOSED on mondays or tuesdays.. (i cant remember)!"
"a must visit when in Seoul!! Changdeokgung is special among the five grand palace, with its Secret Garden or Huwon, a serene garden located at the back of the palace, once used by the royals for leisure and relaxing. You better visit in the morning when it's not crowded yet. entrance tiket is for free if you visit wearing hanbok. we visited the palace on Thursday, and we can enter the Garden without joining a guided tour, which normally on any other day, we only able to enter the garden on a guided tour. take your time visiting the palace and the secret garden, and don't forget to visit Changgyeonggung, which located right next to Changdeokgung"
"Very informative and interesting to walk through. Get some idea of history of the country. Architecture is stunning.

Takes about 1 to 1 1/2 hours ."
"Well worth a visit, gorgeous palace and grounds plus gardens. Not sure if we hit a special occasion but lots of young Koreans dressed in traditional costume made the visit so authentic. Don't miss it"
We had already been to the other palace so we found this a bit repetitive and nothing new. So one can choose to ignore if short on time. Also do note that it is closed on Monday so if you do plan to visit plan accordingly
"I dont really understand what is the hype about? I'm sorry, although it is a beautiful place, I do prefer Gyeongbokgung.

The great thing about this place is that it follows the natural contour of the land, so be prepared to do a lot of walking. The grounds are huge! but you would need to pay an extra ticket for the Secret Garden.

For the elderly, it's not such a friendly place because of the natural topography.

Recommend you to come here if you have nothing else to do. Also, get a guide to fully understand the history of this palace."
"This is the 2nd palace i would recommend going to , besides Gyeongbokgung. This palace was the working palace for most of the Joseon dynasty and contains a lot of history and stories. When walking around please notice the number of layers of the stone foundation. Only royalty or important nobles could have 3 layers , others could only have 2 or less. pleas also notice the chimneys at the back of the buildings ( and not on top of the buildings). They provided underfloor heating from the earliest times. Here is a tip , try to join a free walking tour of the palace , it only takes 2 hours and its most entertaining. go to the visitkorea site to look for these tours. They are done by volunteers who dont want tips or payment. so bring some chocolates as gifts. but their knowlege is immense and they tend to be retirees who do this for a pastime."
Enjoy the serenity in the city; the secret garden is a must visit. Visit the website to check out current events. Palace visit does not always have to be educational.
"Entrance fee is only 3,000 Won making it super cheap. You also have the option of having a guided tour, not sure what the costs are. The palace is beautiful especially if you've never seen something similar. Within the palace grounds you also have the option of seeing the secret garden, however, this has to be guided and costs 5,000 Won, takes about an hour. Its not really a garden, more a forest that has hidden spots within it. Beautiful and worth the time."
"We love 昌德宮，every where like check point for take photo. Here, We dressed Hando and take beautiful pictures."
"I didn't bother going in but basically is just a palace with an admission fee of 1,000 Korean won. A walking distance from the city hall"
The palace is quite big and it is the grandest one compared to other palace. You can still see the footprints of ancient time. A secret garden is very well preserved and only with tour guide is allowed to explore the garden.
"I had a literal 24 hours in Seoul on a stopover and I was able to tour this beautiful palace with a local friend. The English tour was very informative and I learnt so much about what life would have been like at the palace throughout the ages! The architecture is gorgeous and the interior paintwork is like a mosaic of colour. I didn't have time to go into the secret garden, plus it was the middle of winter, but it was a lovely morning, well spent. They had a useful luggage storage locker facility, which was good as I was hauling at lot of gear.

I fully recommend visiting the palace if you are staying in Seoul, whether for a ridiculously short time like I was or for a longer time."
This is a must see especially for the guard changing! The museum is well layed out and informative. Entrance fee is cheap too.
"This place is a good example if you want to see Korea in the past. You will see the design of their houses and gardens. Prepare yourself to walk around the hilly landscape. But, if you feel like to shed some pounds, enjoy walking."
"We had limited time for the palace itself, but were lucky enough to be there for the changing of the guard (traditional ceremony). Quite nice...but stay away from the big drum...."
"My favorite of the Palaces as it is built into hilly landscape. The buildings are well laid out with many interesting angles and details. But it's crowning glory is the Secret Garden. Garden Tour can be purchased separate from entry to Palace and in my opinion is a must. Only a couple of English speaking tours in an afternoon so plan accordingly. We had a very large group but the very capable tour guide, OK(her initials) had it well in hand. Don't miss the lovely little gift shop!"
Good example of Korean traditional architecture. Don't miss the thron hall and the hidden garden and walking aroundn
Very interesting palace which was the old palace. The different buildings on sight gives the option to understand how did the leaders live.
"I don't know too much about Korea but this palace compound was built in 1405 so it's well over 600 years old. Interesting to see this in the center of Seoul with all the traffic and other more modern buildings. To be honest, after visiting the Forbidden City in Beijing, any other Asian palace pales in comparison. It was still interesting to travel into Seoul to see it."
"This is a nice place, enjoyed going there, but could also have missed it. But I guess you should always visit one Palace when you are in Seoul."
This was my favourite palace of the ones that I visited. The grounds are expansive. The Secret Garden at the back [separate entry] was very tranquil. My only reservation--applicable to all the palaces--is they are empty of furniture. This palace is one of the two eastern palaces that can readily be visited as a tandem and is all very close to the Jongmyo Shrine.
"I was positively surprised...
Living in China I have seen a lot of palaces and temples etc. and usually it's all more or less the same. This one was worth to enter for 3.000... Not supercool but different than others..."
Changdeokgung Palace is so beautiful. Very peaceful and a wonderful place to explore; the grounds are very pretty. This is definitely a must visit when in Seoul.
"What I really liked about this palace was its gardens and the famous ""secret garden"" consider that you can only access that one with a guided tour booked on-site. Beautiful place under the cherry blossoms."
"This is a must visit place - beautiful palace grounds and quiet and pretty Secret Garden. I would not bother with the tour, just go and enjoy the beautiful fauna."
"Changdeokgung Palace secret garden is a must visit! This requires a separate entry ticket, but well worth it. The garden is very well maintained and simply beautiful and very enjoyable for a leisurely walk. Join the guided tour for background information about each of the sites within the garden. Allow at least 2-3 hours so you can enjoy the palace leisurely. The palace (building) portion itself is nice, but the highlight is really the secret garden (rear garden). For those who are hoping to see the pond and bridge featured in the Korean Drama ""Rooftop Prince"" - sadly the drama is not filmed here. Nevertheless, the garden is still beautiful and worth a morning's visit!"
Absolutely stunning! Just like what I have seen in Korean historical drama and movies. Come early to explore from corner to corner
"I'm sure that it would be awesome when there is a festival or something going on. Even though it was just a walk and look at the architecture, it was a pleasant walk through this massive state. The palace hall was beautifully kept and the buildings go on and on. Very inexpensive at 1500 won. (US $1.40)"
The palace provides an opportunity to reflect on some of the older history of Korea. It has been well restored and it is a pleasant place to visit on a nice day.
"Second palace after gyeobokgung,building structur same like gyeongbokgung.in the back of this palace there is secret garden(huwon gongwon).must buy tiket again 5000krw and must with tourguide.you can choose it's depend on time and language."
"We spent 3 hours in the afternoon following the map wondering around the beautiful pavillions and enjoyed fresh air, cool breeze and many gardens that full of blooming azaleas and other plants. Some sections were hilly but we took the opportunity to sitdown and rest after every climbs."
"It was great timing that a concert was happening when we visited this palace. An orchestra played and an opera singer performed beautiful traditional Korean songs. Surrounded by the palace structures, the music played fit for their king made one feel like a throwback in the Joseon era."
Much smaller grounds and we loved the secret garden. The walk around the lake was very relaxing. The architecture is amazing. Lots of places to have a picnic.
I was lucky enough to watch changing of Royal Guards ceremony. It was so disciplined. The guards were cladded in their traditional colorful eye catching dresses and armor. It is really a beautiful moment to shoot such a nice ceremony. The dresses were so detailed and the make up too. I would definitely recommend tourists to spare an hour or so to watch changing of royal guards and the palace. Happy travelling!!
"There is much history here on these grounds! Changing of the guard was amazing and very colorful! The Korean Folk museum was very interesting to spend a few hours out of the hot sun! Beautiful gardens, ponds, and well manicured trees and shrubs! Fantastic background for professional looking photos!"
"Similar to Gyeongbokgung, good for exposure to local culture. Few areas to rest away from the sun. Has a secret garden but it requires a fee.

Bonus is that it's connected to Changgyeongung Palace (found in the entrance to the secret garden). Changgyeongung has more trees (more cover from the sun), more areas to rest in.

Compared to Gyeongbokgung, this place has markedly less people. (Or maybe we were just lucky then)."
"Visited changdeokgung because we wanted to see the secret garden. Missed this in winter so we're back in spring and wow, it does require advance booking if you wanna see the secret garden.. slots get booked very quickly.
The tour was informative and led by a professional guide. The secret garden was beautiful! It was raining but that didn't hinder us. Recommended :)"
Recommend to join the guided tour of both the palace and the garden without which is just a stroll in the park without appreciating how the architecture changes with time e.g. Driveway at one of the buildings. Was winter so was cool to make those walks.
It was just simply amazing! There's no words that I can use to describe the feeling that overcame me when I visited this palace. It was like I simply wished that I could have seen when it was a place where people still lived. It was like a maze and the structures were impressive! The intricate designs were gorgeous! What I love about it is the people who came to see the area wearing hanboks! I so love them dearly! They we're really really amazing! They all look so lovely and pretty!
"We went there because it was close to the hotel. It's really pushed as breathtaking but it's not. It's a smaller version of the Gyeongbokgung Palace. It's also a replica. The origami was destroyed and this was rebuilt strictly for tourists. It's buildings only, no furniture or anything else that would help you imagine what life would have been like. The good thing is that it's free for seniors."
"The palace is not as big as the Gyeongbukgong but the highlight of this place is the beautiful huwon. Best to go on a tour to see this. You pay a little more but you get treated to some ""secret spots"" that are normally not accessible with the regular entrance ticket.

We went early to queue for the English tour at 10:30 on a Sunday. Or you can reserve on their website a week before visiting and just pay upon pick up."
"My friends and I decided to have a hanbok experience. We rented our hanbok from one of the rental shop nearby the palace. Our rental was only for 2 hours, so we decided to hurriedly explore the palace. When wearing hanbok, the entrance fee to the palace is FREE!
It's better to come early to the palace ground to beat the crowd!
I didn't get time to enter the famous secret garden, but i believe it's beautiful. The palace ground itself is really beautiful. Showing the grand and elegance of the Jeoson dynasty. Some of the king's collections can be seen. Also, we can see interesting side of an actual weatern bed that the king used at the end of the japanese occupation in Korea."
"We visited Changdeokgung Palace based on a recommendation and to visit the Secret Garden. To visit required to two tickets or you can get a ticket for W 10,000 which allows visits to other palaces. The palace is a UNESCO heritage sight. However the walk in the Secret Garden was lovely - a bit of an oasis in the middle of Seoul. It would have been even nicer in earlier spring or fall as the leaves would be lovely. A nice way to get a bit of exercise."
"Beautiful & super big palace, you have to walk a lot but you can't miss.

The Korea architecture is really good with use of bright colours onto the building.

It's really good to see local people visiting palaces in colourful traditional dress !!

Must visit place !!"
"It was wonderful place especially in spring!
I can see a Korean palace with beautiful sky in harmony.
Actually I considered to visit Gyeongbokgung or Changdeokgung just befort a day of visit.
But I'm sure Changdeokgung is better because I've heard several comments about Gyeonbokgung that there are too much people to enjoy that place.
However Changdeokgung is good enough to enjoy the gung with nice weather, beautiful building and so on.
And I recommend to use an application the ""Real, Changdeokgung"" which guides you based on your location. It is very helpful to tour Changdeokgung.
Alwasy it's true that ""Your knowledge determines your insight.""
At that point, it was awesome and to wonderful application to visit Changdeokgung."
"We missed the English tour and you can only tour the secret gardens as part of one of the palace's official tours, but we had a great private tour guide who sweet talked them into letting us join the Korean language tour. We would have had a great time enjoying the sites with a regular guide but our guide was extremely knowledgeable about the site (she used to work there) and the colour and history she added really makes all the difference in understanding the structure, the design and history including impacts of the Japanese occupation - don't cut your experience short, a good tour guide really makes all the difference."
"The secret garden should be more interesting during the fall ! The different types of trees would certainly be a feast for the eyes! Foliage was all green only when I visited. The entrance fee was 3 000 won, & there is a separate charge to enter the secret garden (5000 won) It would be nice to get 1 or 2 k won discount if buy it together though!
The palace itself is interesting as the orientation differs from most other palaces.
Changyunggung can be accessed inside the palace. Entrance of 1000 won can be purchased at gate, & with proof of the changdeokgung ticket stub, can re enter from the same place . Worth to do it together ."
"Make sure to get a tour of the gardens. The palace is lovely and the architecture is impressive, but nothing you won't see at the other palaces. The garden is really the main point of coming here."
We actually stumbled on this palace by accident I wanted to go to the main palace but this closes on Tuesdays so said we would go to this as we were on our last day- the secret garden is a must- try reserve a tour online before you go (day before) as we were not able to do the tour but luckily got tickets to wander about ourselves. Stunning.
"You really shouldn't miss the lovely Changdeokgung palace in Seoul, one of the five grand palaces built by the kings of the Joseon Dynasty. The buildings are wonderful, colorful and impressive, but the highlight of my visit to the palace grounds was no doubt the guided walk through the Secret Garden. Make sure to include this in your visit! The guide was very knowledgeable and spoke excellent English. I visited the gardens in early March, but would love to go back in spring, summer or fall to enjoy the changing colors of the beautiful trees and flowers. Must be quite a sight!

Highly recommended. A must visit when in Seoul."
"The palace is lovely but the highlight is the secret garden. You need to join a guided tour, which isn't something we usually do, but the tour guide was interesting and easy to understand. We reserved our places on-line, which was easy to do and can be done up to 6 days in advance. Tours in English are at 10.30, 11.30, 2.30 and 3.30. You do need to allow yourself 15-20 mins to walk from the main entrance gate to the start of the tour. If you are planning to visit the garden then you really should buy a combination ticket. This cost W10,000 (less than £7) and includes entrance to the secret garden as well as entrance to four palaces and the royal shrine. Given that Changdeokgung Palace and Garden costs W8,000 together, the combo ticket is excellent value. You need to take your reservation details to the main ticket office to exchange it for a secret garden ticket before entering the palace."
"Changdoekgung is by far the best preserved palace in Seoul. While Gyeongbukgung is more famous, it has been altered more. I suggest you take the English speaking tour for your 1st visit, there are usually 2 or more a day. The tour takes you through the grounds and into a couple of the buildings, but more importantly takes you too the Hidden Gardens, ponds, and summer retreat palace buildings. Korean landscaping is much more natural than other gardens.

If you only have a couple days in Seoul, I put this high on the list of places to go. It is in central Seoul and close to Gyeongboekgung, Insadong, City Hall, Myeongdong, and Namdaenum."
"The palace is one of the sights you need to see if you visit Seoul. It's historic and evocative, although the actual building interiors and surroundings are a bit austere and lifeless, as opposed to a more full-functioning actual monastery. The buildings themselves have been very nicely restored, however, and the grounds are impressive. Since the palace is right downtown it is easily accessible by subway, downtown hotels, etc.

Seeing only this sight/palace, as opposed to something more current and vibrant for the modern population would be a mistake, but if you have a few hours this is the kind of place that gives a sense for the history of Korea. It is also possible to rent traditional costumes nearby which can lend a novel flavor to your trip, and your photos, so long as you are willing to play the part and simultaneously feel a bit ridiculous."
"So many things to say about the palace it definitely deserves a visit. I went on a Friday so I was able to buy the tickets including the pass for the Secret Garden on site . I know you can book online but somehow it wouldn't work on my phone nor iPad. Prepare to spend at least 3 hours on this site. The garden was so beautiful, words fail to describe its beauty, so here are some pictures."
"Part of our trip is to learn about Korean history, hence we visit this Palace and were glad we did. The Palace ground is huge but we managed to covered all. Worth visiting"
Make sure you get to see the changing of the guard which happens at regular intervals throughout the day. Closed Mondays. Free entry if you wear traditional Korean Hanbok clothing - for hire very reasonably in various locations around the palace.
The palace was only 10-15 minutes on foot from Anguk subway station. It might be the most beautiful one in Seoul. The cherry blossom was everywhere in the palace at the time we were visiting it. Walking around it might take less than an hour but we decided to slowly do so with resting and feeling the breeze of history blowing on us. So much enjoyful and peaceful!
A nice place to know the history of Seoul or South Korea. Much better if you have a guide so that they can explain every aspects in the palace.
"went there specifically for the renowned Secret Garden sights end of March, the cherry blossom season. You gotta pay extra for this Secret Garden guided tour, as they wont let you in by yourself. otherwise you just pay for the general admission fee. Seem wearing a Hanbok will get you some discount on the entrance fee. the old heritage building is well maintained and upon entering we were greeted by 2 blooming white cherry blossom tree. there were a few more pink cherry blossom further in. as for the Secret Garden tour, very informative tour guide and very friendly. there are different language tour session, so know when is preferred time slots. Was a disappointed though with the scenery as the flowers are not in bloom and the trees are still withered from winter. Be prepared for a little up slope hike. Really choose your visiting season well or else be disappointed. Tour guide recommend to visit during full blown spring, authumn and winter (with snow covering the land) to enjoy the place true beauty. perhaps 1 day will revisit again."
"3rd palace,which I visited...small but full of surprises inside.. you must come to experience .. it is also close in everything, restaurants,banks,hotels etc"
Another must visit palace. The buildings are old but well maintained. Great place for photo taking and walk.
"Must go before 10:00am for morning session for during that time, its change of guides and that's when the shows in on.

See how their Kings Life styles.

Tour Guide will tell you the history"
Changdeokgung Palace was place to walk around and discover. You can take a tour which includes a garden tour. It was quite beautiful in late March with the cherry blossoms. Less crowds in early morning!
"I really enjoyed seeing the palace grounds at Changdeokgung. We visited on a Sunday afternoon. It wasn't terribly crowded. The architecture is pretty amazing. We hope to visit the secret garden in the spring or early summer. It's very inexpensive to get in, so definitely worth a stop if you have an hour or so in your schedule."
This palace is simply breath-taking. Take a scroll at Huwon & enjoy the beauty. Required lots of walking & stairs thus need some stamina. Must do booking online if you want to go to Huwon.
"Got here just in time to roam around the outside of the palace and see the displays of the old tools and homes. The place is very nice. We did not go in to the museum but you get to learn a lot of the heritage from the outside too.

Must witness the changing of the guard which we caught at 1pm."
"We followed the free English guided tour, she really adds to the experience by explaining the history behind the raised stone walkway to the clever secret of the dragon heads on the roof top. The tours are only at set times so make you check out the times before you go.
The palace itself and the picturesque gardens really give you a good idea of the lifestyle and culture of the people that once lived there.

You might also see many Korean couples dress in the traditional attire (hanbok), walking around posing for photos. It's a common Korean couple activity as well as for wedding photos."
"A worthwhile place to visit there is a traditional guard ceremony at the main gate every 2 hours
The palace grounds are nice to walk round and loads of information in English."
The palace is great but the secret garden is definitely worth it. Only a few dollars to walk though gorgeous greenery.
"I appreciate Korean Palaces so much because it shows how much they treasure their history. It was well preserved and strictly kept clean, and thus it has become a highly respected place. I wish the Philippines valued its history as much as Koreans did. :("
"I enjoyed walking through this old palace. When you go early in the morning, it is not as busy and the atmosphere is great. Wonderful place to take pictures and imagine for yourself the busy lives of people living here in the past."
"2nd visit to this palace. But 1st time going for the Secret Garden tour.
Just have to do online reservation in 1 week advance for which language the tour would be conducted in. Reach the palace at least 20 mins before tour starts to secure booking.
Went during Spring time, and trees look bare. Scenery would have been beautiful in Autumn.
Secret Garden tour took around 1.5 hours to finish and there are up/down slopes to take on which might be tricky for elderly. It's still manageable to walk at your own pace, just that will be missing out on the introduction of the corners. Friendly tour guide are more than willing to share and answer queries which you might have for the sites.

Would love to be back during Autumn!"
Yes really similar to Gyeongbokgung palace but still nice to see and walk around. I also booked a tour to the secret garden (I booked it 4 days in advance) but I wouldn't recommend it in winter or early march/april. We had a lovely english tour guide but the secret garden is nothing I haven't seen before and it can be hard for some people to walk up the steep hill. I would only go back to the secret garden in autumn other than that I would skip it to be honest.
"Although this is a ""secondary"" palace it is no less of a ""must-see"" destination in Seoul. There is a beautiful park towards the back part of the palace grounds that is wonderful for walking."
It is beatifull-especially when all other palaces are closed like Tuesday.and this one is open.they are coming a lot of people in Hanbok and you can enjoy beatifull scenery of UNESCO site!
"Nice if you have the time, if not I would opt for Gyeongbokgung palace and the Bukchon Hanok Village (around sunset it's even nice). As many of the touristic sites many tourists and locals are wearing traditional Korean clothing so you can get some nice (and sometimes funny) pictures."
"Beautiful architecture! Especially the roofs and how every building's roof layer with each other. If you like ancient oriental architecture this is a must visit.

You will also see many people walking around in Hanbok. I believe it is because entering in Hanbok is free and it's a great place to take photos in Hanbok too.

There is also a separate area called the Secret Garden which one can only enter by joining a guided tour that comes in different languages. I chose the English tour and learnt a lot about the palace's history."
"This Palace is very similar to the Gyeonbokgung Palace, but much smaller. If you are short on time I would go to the Gyeonbokgung Palace. An hour would be enough to see the entire place."
"this is probably the second famous palace tourist will visit. entrance fee is USD2.60 for adult and free for children below 6. the secret garden is only allowed with guided tour, make sure you book ur tour at least 1month in advance. cuz it normally sold out on the day itself. Otherwise, just freely rom around the garden is very relax too. suggest to visit in spring.. there are 2 big peach blossom tree which is very nice for photo taking"
A great experience as part of the Korean culture. It's interesting to get the guided tour in order to understand what each building was for. Also a tour of the secret garden is recommended. Very beautiful but even more so with spring and specially in fall.
This palace not as big as Gyeongbokgung palace but its connected to Changgyeonggung palace. If you want to go to Secret Garden better use Hanbok (Traditional Korea T-Shirt) because its free
This is a world heritage site. I went on a day visit. It was great. You can walk around and learn about the history of Joseon South Korea. There are lots of restaurants near by and places to rest along your walk.
"Not to miss if you are in Seoul historical area. Similar to Gyeongbokgung palace for most of the people. Maybe experts will notice some differences.
Nevertheless interesting walk through the various buildings (however not allowed to go inside) and the park.
During spring time the trees are starting to bloom and everything becomes beautiful.

For people not speaking korean language, there are free guided tours provided in other languages (english, chinese, japanese,..)

The entry fee of 3000W (approx. 3$) is very reasonable. You may add 5000W (5$) for the secret garden which is part of the park but only accessible at certain times and number of visitors is limited to 100 per tour in order to preserve the area."
"The palace complex is similar to many others. If you have been to a few palaces it's more of the same. If it's your first one then it's great as it id not too large. Palace took over an hour to explore.
Worth popping in to the Secret Garden at the back...An additional 5000 won for the 90min tour. Very pretty garden and a nice change from the palace buildings.
Interesting contrast seeing city buildings all around the palace.
Easily accessible from Anguk station on the orange line. Take exit 3 and walk straight ahead. 5 mins max.
Bukchon area is very close by too with traditional homes, restaurants and shopping."
"This is one of the Unesco heritage sites one should visit when in Seoul. It is the palace where the last remaining members of the Korean monarchy lived until the 1980s. So you will be able to see how they lived here during the 1900s to 1980s and witness the traces of modern contraptions during that era. Although the infrastructure of most of the buildings within the palace are not original as the original palace was destroyed during a fire, the new structures (still pretty old since it was rebuild in the 1700s to 1800s) are magnificent. I absolutely love the colours and design of the rooftops of the buildings within this palace. There is also the secret garden which is really beautiful and perfect for Instagram and offers you an insight of the life of the Korean monarchy. recommended to join the free tours that is provided (subjected to different timings for Korean, Chinese, Japanese and English). Separate secret garden tours are charged at extra fees. If you intend to visit more than 3 royal palaces in Seoul, would recommend to get the Royal Palace Pass to enjoy more discount on the entrance fees to all of the palaces in Seoul."
"Nice palace to visit , it's huge, many pavilions, tickets are3000 won each not all pavilions are open
You can't actually enter the actual pavilion
I was excited to see some furniture pieces and rooms but nothing really ( unless we totally missed) only the main pavilion you can see the huge throne where the king used to sit
Nice place to visit but enough once"
"The place reminds me of the forbidden palace in Beijing. However, the place is much simpler and smaller.

I'd still say it's a place you must visit on your first trip to Seoul."
"We went there to explore the unesco heritage and we were pleased to be able to understand better the Korean history and culture. The palace is really nice and well maintained and you can visit it with a free guided tour booked on seoul information centre website
If you have time for only one palace maybe not this one thought"
"There are other attractions inside this palace but you have to pay for them e.g. the secret garden. Maybe this is more beautiful during spring bloom or summer. Not so interesting during winter.
Bring a stroller if you have young children."
It's another palace that is located in Seoul city center. Lots of Cherry trees and this facts makes the best time to visit stout April when the cheery blossom is at its peak.
"We enjoyed our 2 hour visit on a sunny morning in late-March. The first cherry trees were in blossom beside some of the palace buildings, and everyone was taking photos beside them. There were lots of visitors but the place is so big you can easily get away from the crowds. We enjoyed seeing locals in Korean dress, it helped us imagine what the palace looked like when in use. After lunch we walked around Bukchon village and had a great day."
So great to see Korea's cultural past on display. It is great to walk the grounds and imagine what it would have been like during those times.
"Saw changing of the guards

Buildings are very interesting and seem to be in the middle of Seoul

If you can go with a guide or someone knowledgeable it makes the visit far more informative

Prepare to spend a couple of hours"
"The palace was nice and was interesting. Not sure if they do it everyday, but while we were there, a lot of people dressed in historic local attire, both male and female, were there and it was very neat. Very friendly people and willing to take pictures with the tourists without having to pay. When they close, they close and they have several people rounding up slow moving people pushing them toward the door..so don't plan to get there late and overstay."
"For tourist who likes touristy and history - the place to go.

Walked the palace and discovered many interesting facts too.

Worth going!"
"You can go any season but each season I think evokes a different ambiance to the place. It's a very relaxing place.

Go for the guided tour. It will greatly help."
"This was the second palace I wisted, the design and style is so Intricate, wonderful place to wander around and feel the essence of korean history."
"Ideally to be see during the blossom time, but great anytime. Wonderful tour...well worth it. The guide was very knowledgeable and spoke excellent English."
"This lacks the grandeur of Gyeongbukgung but I liked the serene feel of this palace, especially if you go for the Suwon. The area open to public is quite small, as majority of the land is within the secret garden tour. Actually, you can't explore the whole place even with the secret garden tour but it was worth the extra pay."
"Very relaxing, interesting place most especially if youre familiar with korean series ( traditional korean series theme). The secret garden part was mesmerizing. You could only imagine what was life before aged in Seoul. How they managed to restore those Korean architecture."
"The palace is located around the city and easy to go to there and rich the area.
The palace is also wonderful"
"The palace is rather grand to walk around, with many halls scattered around the large compound. Initially it was quite interesting, but after a while, the subsequent halls look quite the same. Still a great visit to explore the history of South Korea."
"This palace is across the street from the Great King SeJong. It's a long walk so take some walking shoes. There is a National Palace Museum of Korea inside on the left. We found some pretty cool souvenirs you can't find anywhere else in Seoul! You can peek over the wall, and there is the Blue House. If you book in advance, you can visit the Blue House too. We got cancelled because of the demonstration happening during our visit."
"I went in March and in the fall. I preferred it much more in the fall with the colorful leaves. This time around, it was deserted and quite sad looking. I also went to the Secret Garden and did not enjoy it during March. Go there in the spring, summer or fall. Don't waste your time and money in the pre-spring season."
"During winter time the beauty of this place is impaired, so if you have to choose go to Gyeongbokgung Palace instead. However, in Autumn and Spring time, I believe this might be a must seeing sight. Before going, check on the website the guided tour timetable, since you can only visit the Secret Garden if you join one. It works the same way for the Jongmyo Shrine, but if I'm not wrong you can visit it without guide on Saturdays."
"1) One of the most beautiful places in Seoul. Great palace of thousand doors and windows and a Secret garden.
2) Open (spring) 9:00–18:00. Closed on mondays. Best time — weekdays evening (16:00–18:00).
3) Admission fee is 3000 won for palace and 5000 won for garden (require palace ticket).
4) Access to the Garden is allowed only with guided tours. The last English tour starts at 15:30.
5) Good cafe (no food, only drinks) and a shop."
"This palace is beautiful and it is a more manageable size. It was a quiet day in October when I visited and the Secret Garden tour made it more special. English tours are available and they sold out fast, so plan the trip in advance. The tour guide was very knowledgeable and patient, gave everybody an opportunity to ask question and take pictures. It was beautiful and also a bit sad to see the pound in the format of the unified Koreas (South and North) and makes you wish that one day they become the same country again.
It is a lot of walking up and downhill and the tour ends in a place where you need to climb uneven stairs but it is manageable"
"So many palaces to choose from in Seoul, Changdeokgung was my favourite and it was walking distance (5 minutes) from Rak Ko Jae (See my review of the Hanok we stayed at.) There is a package deal for KW$10,000 for 4 or 5 palaces including a 70-minute guided tour of the Secret Garden at Changdeokgung; this is a must for those interested in its history.
You can purchase the package at any of the palaces ticket offices.

The guided tour is informative and you will be given time for photos and a short break. You won't regret it!

For those of you interested in Seoul's history, stop by the Seoul Museum of history first, it'll give you a good background of the city."
"This place has a nice park. And the beautiful buildings. The weather was cold enough, but The Sun was shine."
The secret garden is beautiful anytime of the year. But lots of walking and steps. Lots of locals in costumes as well to enjoy
"While smaller in size to the grand palace of Gyeongbokgung this is indeed a little treasure. Don't miss the secret Garden it is an extra admission and tickets can be brought outside the entrance of the Secret Garden towards the back of the palace grounds. We were lucky to go late November and the fall foliage was beautiful. The Secret Garden is by tour only. If you appreciate history, learning about Korean royalty history or architecture designs you will love this."
"Interesting palaces and gardens. Unfortunately in February no flowers or leaves on trees so the beauty of the gardens could not be seen. Good guides, especially my group had a very good guide for the Secret Garden tour. The Secret Garden tour is limited to groups of max 100 persons. Plenty of walking so not good for people with limited mobility. Not fun to visit on a rainy day."
"Really large palace, there is a secret garden but you can only visit with tour guide, dont miss it and check to tour guide time for it not expencive"
"This palace complex is a good example how Korea preservs its history. Very well conserved. Those palace are a historic mark of the glorious period of Joseon Dynasty in Korea, from 1392 to 1910. Its offer two english tours in the morning and two or three in the afternoon depends on the period of the year. For foreigners is mandatory to take the English tour."
"It's not the biggest, but in my opinion is the most beautiful! The palaces are all somewhat similar but the secret garden tour makes this one stand out from the rest. If your short on time, make this palace a priority! It may not be ask we'll known as the main palace but it is stunning!"
"The pity thing is that we came there on a cold rainy day. Anyway, we still really enjoy the beautiful peaceful scenery of Changdeokgung Palace. This place is huge, make sure to follow the guides, otherwises we will get lost.
We were there in April, so there're cherry blossoms blossoming. There're many other beautiful flowers in the palace too. Great place to enjoy peace, nature and take photos."
"We visited the Changdeokgung Palace as a part of the day trip in Seoul. It is a compex of beautifusl, historical palaces that unfold a rich Korean history. No wonder it is a UNESCO preserved heritag sight. This is a must-see while visiting Seoul."
"This palace is much smaller than Gyeong Bok palace, but you will definately get a more out of this gem. Changdeok Palace has a garden that is only accesible through tour groups formed at the tocket booth. It is unnecessary to make reservaions if you are in a party under four, they offer walking tours in English, Chinese and Japanese. The royal garden is full of ancient trees, beautiful architecture and landscaping that is particular to the Korean culture, it is less tended and more close to a forest than a typical western garden. Don't hesitate to go on this tour as it is worth your money and time!"
"It long hard journey to come there by walking.. the secret garden there very beauty...scarlet heart actress are acting there... it worth to come., many of historical evidence you may learn.. i love the tour guide explanation all about the secret garden..please come there in the 4 season..the beauty views for 4 season are different..i suggest come on spring. All flower bloom and winter also you may see the frozen lake..."
"I love history and looking at architecture. Hence, visiting the palaces in South Korea is a must. You can visit Changdeokgung, Changgyeonggung, Gyeongbokgung and Deoksugung at 10,000KRW by purchasing the combined ticket. This also includes Jongmyo shrine which I did not visit as I'm not interested.

Visiting in Winter is definitely cold and you won't be able to see the pretty flowers and beautiful green scenery (if you want to see those, the in-house guide said spring/autumn is good). But it gives another sense of imagination as the in-house guide brings you around the palaces - the reality of power struggle within the palace - together with the cold winter.

Architecture and the reason why certain places were built are interesting too. Definitely a must visit if you want to go deeper into the history of Korea. Of course, you won't become an expert at it but at least a good understanding if you follow through the guide or simply just download the app for each palaces and just walk through it by reading."
"It is not only beautiful to behold , but even your imagination is captivated by the rich history of every structure in the Palace grounds. All the Royal Palaces are beautiful to behold ... Korea is a beautiful country with very hospitable people"
"While Kyeoungbok-gung is a workibg quarters for the King, this place is the actual living quarters for the royal family. Much restoration has been done to correct Japanese mischief during the occupation. It's a cosy and pretty place, a palace"
"Changdeokgung Palace is worth the visit considering that it is a UNESCO world heritage site. The temples and open spaces are not as grand as the newer Gyeongbokgung Palace, but its charm is rooted in the simplicity and humility of the structure and in the magnificent lay-out of the secret garden (accessible upon payment of additional 5,000 KRW). The views of the palace and the garden, however, are not as breath-taking as the views during spring or autumn. With all humility, winter views are only great if snow is thick and not yet melting. During our visit, snow is already melting, and all that's left were leafless trees and frozen ponds. Consolation comes from our tour guide who shared interesting trivia about the palace and gardens."
so interesting and full of history. Cannot believe you are standing at a Palace built so long ago with such ancient traditions.
This was our first activity in Seoul and it was a wonderful introduction into Korean history and architecture. It was raining the entire time that we were there so we did not do the secret garden. Luckily the rain did not ruin the experience of the palace.
"Overall it was a great experience. Take a lot of photos!! If you're wondering whether or not you should pay the extra buck for Secret Garden, do not hesitate- do it. I visited in the winter and Secret Garden was the highlight of my day. Enjoy beautiful views and architecture while you listen to the tour guide's explanation of why each section of the palace existed :) but it does involve a lot of walking and climbing up some stairs, especially during the winter it could be a little harder for older visitors. We spent more time there than originally planned."
"Among the palaces we visited in Seoul, this is my favorite. Great architecture. Feels like I was in one of the Saeguk dramas. Don't miss the Secret Garden and Deoksugung within the complex."
"Really impressive from an architectural viewpoint, with a number of different palaces for the King, the Queen and Concubines. The Secret Garden is a joy (extra charge though) and should be at its best in the Spring. Great place to escape the turmoil of modern-day Seoul."
"It's for the historical and/ or archaeological freak. Cobbled walk corridors, muddy open courtyards, snow covered parks, roof that has its corners flipped and curled upwards towards the sky. It's a little too cold for visiting in the winter. It's probably a nice sight in spring when all the cherry blossoms are in full bloom. Nonetheless it still has its charm with snow covered roofs."
"Really like this palace. I bought a combination ticket but it was not enough for me, I went 3 times!
Go early in the morning 9am on a weekday and you practically get the whole palace to yourself. Walk around and immerse in its beauty & serenity.
Definitely join a guided tour to know more about the grounds. Check their website for timings for various language guided tours. We went for the 10:30am English tour. Very nice. It ends just in time at 11:20am for you to catch the 11:30am secret garden guided tour.
The secret garden is only available on guided tour, with extra ticket, so check online for secret garden reservations or go early to book a spot at the ticket counter. It's worth a visit so don't miss out.
Although many buildings are new, as the originals were burnt down during the Japanese war, it's still an interesting place to visit. Recommended!"
"I chose to go to only this Palace since it's on the UNESCO heritage site list and it also boasts a very beautiful Secret Garden. On the day that I was there, it rained before and as I was leaving the Palace. It's a very beautiful place to go even if just for the garden. I liked that while there were many people there, it wasn't crowded. I bought a ticket for the Secret Garden so there would be a guided tour. The guide wasn't very proficient in English so it was difficult to grasp what he was trying to say. It is easy enough to enjoy the Garden without a guide anyway."
"very beautiful palace, however, you have to purchase separate ticket if you want to visit backyard garden. i personally think the garden is not so special during winter.

they do provide free tour guide in chinese, korean and english. very good service.

if you have time, rent traditional korean costume from shops outside the palace will make this trip more memorable. and if i'm not wrong, you can enter this palace for free if you are wearing Korean Hanbok."
"the palace is 5 minutes walk from Anguk station, exit 1. Fortunately during my visit, I've been granted by free admission as the palace open for free on the last Wednesday of every months. The temperature was very cold as i visited the place during the winter and i suggest you to avoid winter if you wish to fully explore the beauty of the palace. Winter also not too bad as the scenery was stunning, the roofs covers by white fresh snow that make the buildings looks lovely and romantic. But due to negative temperature, it will limit your steps to explore the entire boundary. Believe me, it is worth to at least pay a visit once to this landmark, you will not regret."
"This palace has much to explore, almost every corner has a magical photo opportunity! Especially with all the pretty girls wearing their traditional clothes. Many are more than happy to pose for you, if you ask nicely! We spent around 3 hours walking around all the small buildings and stopped for coffee in the cafe on the grounds, (decent coffee, not overpriced at 3500won)."
"We visited this palace on Day 3 of our trip since it was closed earlier in our trip and I really wanted to see the garden based on the multiple reviews I read. We had already toured Gyeonbukgeong Palace and enjoyed the free tour there. So when you have seen one palace, you don't need to see another one in Seoul. But I thought that the garden tour would be spectacular. It was a beautiful sunny fall day, however there were no flowers, no colours, not even well trimmed trees and bushes. It was so disappointing. Also after paying extra for the tour, the group was so large, 50 plus that it was impossible to hear what the guide was saying as everyone was busy talking at the same time. So my suggestion is definitely visit one palace, but don't come here for the garden as it was not well kept at all."
This is a historically significant and beautiful palace to visit during a trip to Seoul. We saw this palace along with others on a tour for people associated with the American military and their families. It is beautiful in the fall and offers many great photo opportunities.
"You can't miss this place. Make sure you go there with lots of time (i would say at least 3hours) to explore the area. And please wear comfartable clothes and shoes because you will be walking a LOT.
Paying for the guided tour is important for you to learn a lot the local history.
Take time to choose a quiet spot, sit down and observe Korea people who goes there. You would be amazed how much you can learn by observing the way they interact with each other, how they respect their culture and people.
I was truly amazed!!!"
Those that come here should see the secret garden as well. This palace is quite plain in the winter. The palace felt dull by the lack of colors.
Running second best to Gyeongbokgung this palace still has a thing or two and can hold its own. I really wanted to do the secret garden but it was closed on the day that I visited.
"Very good architecture, worth a trip to understand the culture.

You can also walk into the deeper end to see the secret garden and the secondary palace for added charge (boooo....)."
"First impression was it was like the other palaces, sculptured tiles and painted roofs. Going on a little farther, one came to a part that looked humbler but actually more beautiful. Plain carved wooden wall and roof. This was built for a concubine and done not to stoked the jealousy of the queen. Would love to come here in warmer clime to see the garden."
"Interesting, but quite a walk not recommended for elderlies. Might be great on summer as flower are bloomed."
"Like the other palace, the place is well preserved and restored.

I would have enjoyed myself more if there were more signages and explanation boards to indicate and describe to visitors of the various locations of the palace, since I did not join any guided tour groups. I ended up walking to places where there were just closed up rooms.

Due to time constraint, I missed the Secret Garden that needed a separate ticket, probably do it on my next visit."
"We visited Changdeokgung Palace in November and the fall foliage was beautiful, especially in the secret garden area. Make sure that you get the ticket that admits you to this area, which is at the back of the palace grounds. A must-visit site when touring Seoul!"
"The palace has a garden inside that is so beautiful. It is only available to ticket holders who are in a group tour. It is possible to reserve tickets in adavance for the garden tour, and I highly suggest doing so since it will likely sell out. I think they offer tours in Korean, English, Chinese, and Japanese. I've only been on the English tour, and the guides were so helpful and provided unique and interesting facts both times I've gone. I really can't stress enough how lovely this place is.

The garden tour is a bit of a walk though, and it does go up and down hills and stairs quite a bit. Just be aware that you'll walk a bit on the tour, but it's worth it."
The palace has a lot of history..This is a must visit when in Seoul. The Bus and or the subway will get you there
"Changdeok Palace is one of my favorite palaces out of the 4 main palaces in Seoul because it houses the Secret Garden. While all the other buildings and corners within the Changdeok Palace premises are pretty and worth seeing, I highly recommend that any new visitors also include a walk through the Secret Garden, which require joining a tour group and paying an entrance fee of KRW 5000 per adult. The tour takes about an hour and is provided in different languages. It's a good idea to check the schedule beforehand. It is fun to hear about the history related to each of the areas within the Palace. The different pavillions are also quite fascinating to see. Also, the Palace is known to have a different look in each season, each unique and each equally worth the visit. It is also conveniently situated near the Seoul central business district. Hope you enjoy!

서울 한복판에 잘 보존되어 있는 창덕궁은 정말 큰 보물인 것 같습니다. 계절마다 다른 아름다움이 있다고 합니다. 이번 크리스마스 직후 추운 날씨에 갔는데도 후원을 거닐면서 각기 다른 정자들을 보는 것이 큰 즐거움이였습니다."
"Not as huge and ""sprawling"" (way to the back) as Gyeongbokgung and also not as ""brightly colorful"" with ceremonial guards & big guard ceremony as at Gyeongbokgung (saw no ceremonial guard whatsoever at the gate here), the ""highlight"" of this palace that sets it apart from all the other palaces is its so-called 'Secret Garden' (a.k.a. Huwon) all the way at the back which is actually a ""big park"" with grown trees, some ponds, beautiful small pavilions (& a pretty big pavilion on a high ground which is off-limits to the public) and an enclosed area with these traditional wooden row buildings forming a perimeter (guess it was like a royal resting place back in the day when they were in the garden, and also learned that the Joseon kings & queens actually took part in planting of trees & such activities, maybe as called for by the royal customs & tradition); I went in with the 12-pm Korean tour (missed my 11-am or 1130-am English tour) which took an hour & a half but it was such a ""well-timed & comfortable"" tour with only like a 10-minute walk at most between every two stops (about six stops in total) and places to sit down at each stop, so an hour & a half went by ""quite pleasantly"".

Another part of interest on the palace grounds is the residential area at the far end on one side (a left turn from the main pathway past the main palace building with the throne stage, or a right turn after coming out of the tour of the Secret Garden) where the last emperor of Korea & his wife after him spent their last years during the Japanese occupation. And a little ""out of the way"" from the rest of the Palace because it's on the other side of the main pathway from the rest of the Palace (a right turn from the main pathway just before getting to the Garden entrance, or a left turn after coming out of the Garden tour) is an enclosed area which was the place for the concubine of one of the Joseon kings.

Coming by subway, Anguk Station (on Line 3) is the nearest one with just a 5-to-10-minute walk east straight on the big Yulgok-ro St. to this palace. There's also the royal residence (not a palace) called Unhyeongung between the station and this palace (but you'll have to do a slight detour by turning right & walking a short distance to get there after coming out of the station). And right beside this palace is another palace called Changgyeonggung which you can actually ""very conveniently"" get to by going out the back exit (right beside the Secret Garden entrance) where you'll get to the high ground overlooking Changgyeonggung with stairs to go down to that palace.

As for the ticket, I suggest getting an ""integrated ticket"" for 10,000 won which is good for a month and which covers this palace and three other palaces namely the main palace Gyeongbokgung, Changgyeonggung (right beside here as mentioned above) & Deoksugung plus Jongmyo Shrine (also just in the vicinity of this palace); and do keep in mind that this palace along with Changgyeonggung & Deoksugung are closed on Mondays and Gyeongbokgung & Jongmyo Shrine are closed on Tuesdays."
"I went there on a very cold day -7c with my friends, the palace is full of stories for visitors to relive again, our Tour guid Ms. Kim was very nice and very smart, she made sure that all of us are enjoying the tour."
"We had an excellent afternoon including a secret garden tour. Without the tour I think it would be hard to enjoy or learn much during a visit, but the information and history provided by the guide during our 75 minute tour were really interesting and nice. Perhaps the group size was bigger than it should have been, but anyway it was a nice afternoon and without the tour it would have been a big disappointment."
We had a great time exploring the palace grounds with a tour guide who gave us the detailed history. The Changing of the Guard ceremony was interesting to watch - a colorful spectacle of traditional drums and march set in the main courtyard. Definitely a site to see if you visit Seoul!
"This is one of the smaller palace in Seoul. The main attraction is Huwon (better known as Secret Garden, but more appropriately known as a the Rear/Back Garden).

It is difficult to plan efficiently for this trip as the English guided tour would clash with the Huwon tour. I had the Huwon tour followed by a self guided walk through the remaining palace compound. You should be a able to cover this within half a day.

After the trip, it would be nice to take a stroll at the nearby Bukchon to see traditional Korean houses. Stop by one of the hill top teahouses to warm up and charge your phones while enjoying tea and the evening city views. Be prepared to put on good walking shoes and to spare the remaining half of the day at this area."
Beautiful palace. It was one of my favourite palace due to the fact that it had the secret garden. It is a bit of a walk so do remember to take water with you and wear good walking shoes. The back lake has the most beautiful view and great for taking photos. Beautiful place to go as a couple.
"This is a magnificent royal palace and a must see in Seoul. The secret garden tour was very interesting and beautiful, I highly recommend taking the guided tour on it."
"Tourists from around the world at the ceremony changes imperial guard. Changing the Guard, accompanied by drums and parade in traditional costumes with military equipment and flags. After the ceremony, walk along the complex imperial palace."
Enjoyed our day here. Some interesting culture and open buildings but all a bit same after a while. Still I'd recommend a visit.
"This palace was built in 2005. It shows the style of the period, but on a cold January day, seemed rather bleak, with nothing but similar style, empty buildings. One building had a lovely painted ceiling, and I believe there is a wonderful garden in better weather."
Visited the palace because of the secret garden which requires a booking. The secret garden is big and spectacular. How I wish to be the emperor back in the times to enjoy the palace
"It was my first time to visit Seoul and apart from the Food Tour, I haven't been to any historical places. This was located by a main road in the city so it was easy to access. The place is not crowded, very spacious inside and will provide you with a lot of understanding about the Buddhist way of life. This good be done through a tour guide who can provide valuable insights as you visit one site to another."
Smaller and quieter than the other palaces. We were travelling on our own and had booked tickets for the secret garden tour online. This was truly one of the highlights of our trip. You don't have to be very fit to join the 1 hour walking tour but they do expect you to stay in the group and not wander off during the tour.
Nice and quiet palace for great photo. Joined the secret garden tour. Good stamina is essential as there are many slopes and kinda steep. The garden is very beautiful though some works is going on at certain places. Lovely maple and ginkgo tree in the compound. Great experience to figure out how was the old times royal family life. Impressive!
"- visited November 2016
- went just a few hours before closing time, so there was no crowd, and it was quiet and peaceful
- better if you purchase the Royal Palace Pass worth 10000 won, which grants access to this palace, plus Gyeongbokgung, Changgyeonggung, Deoksugung, and Jongmyo"
Recommended for families and couples who do not like shopping. Great place to learn about korea culture and history while taking in the scenic views.
"I have been to Changdeokgung for many times. It is the best place for maples.
If you want to enjoy autumn blaze maple, you definitely cannot miss the secret garden. Please make online reservation in advance."
"Go on a guided tour of this palace which the Kings of Korea preferred over Gyeongbuk Palace for its feng shui. The palace was not at all crowded on a Tuesday afternoon last week. Make sure you get there early enough to visit Biwon, the Secret Garden, which closes at 4:00 pm"
"It is better to buy the Combination ticket that costs W10,000 and gives admission to 5 sites and Secret Garden. During peak seasons, it is advisable to book for guided tours via their online portal. The schedule for the guided tours are listed online for easier planning. You can also walk around the plalace ground except the Secret Garden. The guided tour of Secret Garden is highly recommended. Our tour guide was excellent in presenting the history and features of the Secret Garden."
"Beautiful. It is a must!
And the English guide tour was just perfect. Very detailed information & perfect english"
"The palace could be more beautiful during fall, but I visited in winter so it looked the same with other palaces. We booked the huwon garden tour, and again, the tour guide said that the garden was much more beautiful during fall. In winter, it is all snow and frozen ponds. It was nice to hear the tour guide leading us through history, though."
"In this palace, there haveany trees and surrounding was awesome. I believe if during Spring or Autumn, you could see beautiful colors of flowers and red leaves surrounding this palace. A secret garden a must visit spot besides having a massive long walk to this garden of silent. A little pond and resting place will be good for a snapshot or wefie or selfie is memorable. Apart from this wonderful place, there's a little cafe that you can drop by to check out beautiful souvenirs. You can have a cuppa too! Trust me, this is really a nice palace that I love to visit again next time. Thanks to our private tour guide from Top Korea Tour, Juno who explained the historical part of this palace and we were like adventurers exploring the place in and out. Found a little secret locked place~you can find out yourself when you are there.

My mom was cooling resting at the cafe enjoying the view of trees. Totally different feeling from other palaces. For those who appreciate history or architecture designs, you would love what you see. For others, just visit this place to get to know more."
We also join The Secret Garden tour with english speaking guide. Really worth it cause the garden are beautiful and serene. I think may be during autumn this palace will be more beautiful.
"Walking here from Myeongdong was reasonable. There is a small admission fee to explore the grounds. We liked looking at the different buildings. The bathrooms were updated and very clean, which was surprising considering what a big tourist attraction it is."
"Although this palace is smaller than gyeongbokgung, but it is well preserved and lesser tourist here. The structure and design of the palace are pretty similar as Gyeongbokgung. I would prefer this palace than Gyeongbokgung."
"Fell in love with this Palace, specially with its Secret Garden.
The admission fee is 3000 KRW and 5000 KRW for entering Secret Garden.
I went there 2 times because on my first visit I didn't get the ticket for Secret Garden. And worth to come back ❤
Please use comfortable shoes."
"It surrounds with high level of wall, and locates at the heart of the city, really fusion with modern buildings around. Be alert that, it close on Monday. It is calm, scenic and comes in solid culture ambience."
This is a little smaller than others but it has a lot of history. There are signs explaining everything and they are in English. some of the buildings have some furniture inside but not may. It is worth it so come and visit.
"I am definitely biased, but you have been to the forbidden city in Beijing or any of the imperial palaces in China, you really don't need to visit any of the palaces in Seoul, I think. At least with Changdeokung, I found it small, uninteresting and unimpressive. Architecturally, it's similar to the Chinese palaces. The names are in Chinese as well. I really felt like I was in China."
"If you are traveling alone or you need places that are private, you can go here as you can enjoy the views of Korean palace by yourself. This place is less crowded so it will be easy for you to get into the history of Changdeokgung easily. Wearing hanbok is also free here and you can get some relax."
"Visit this palace in the late autumn. Great chance for autumn leaves viewing when discover secret garden. To sight seeing the secret garden, you need to reserve the ticket online or buy on sight at ticket box soon."
"Highly recommended for a visit. This huge Palace complex is a fine example of Korean historical architecture and culture. The grounds were stunning, particularly in Autumn - it's a photograper's dream, particularly with the young local people dressed in traditional dress ( a lovely, popular current trend). Very reasonable entrance fee and so much to see there."
It's an amazing experience to visit the palace at night. Although it only opened during moonlight but we are managed to do so in our visit to Seoul. It's a nice experience to see and experience to the culture.
"This palace is said to be built during the Josun period in the 14th century. Overall the place is nice and beautiful. The interesting part is the main building like a royal court, where there's an interesting dragon decoration high up in the ceiling where visitors can only see it from a certain angle. It's beautiful. There's also a cafeteria and souvenir shop in one of the buildings inside the palace's grounds."
"If you have time for only one palace in Seoul, go here and do the garden visit (guided tour only and quite long). The palace itself is nice, same architectural design as many palaces and temples in Korea. The gardens have a great serene atmosphere and allow you to see really nice parts of the palace complex."
If you love culture and history I'm recommend this place for you since there are many places near it you will need a full day to visit them.
"We visited in October 2016. It was a special day that day when admission was free for the palaces. So we went to all 3 that day. We discovered this at the first one we visited. It was a cool day and overcast. We figured it was good the admission was free because unlike other castles and palaces, all three of the palaces in Seoul are just empty buildings. We enjoyed the walk around the lake and the forested areas."
"love the architecture of this palace. however there is no guard changing ceremony here. overall is a good place to visit when you are in seoul. To go here, the a subway to Anguk Station (Line 3) Exit #3."
It is a very serene place located right in the middle of busy Seoul which we found very interesting. We joined the Secret Garden tour which gave us some insights to the palace grounds. Our tour guide is very knowledgeable and entertaining. We took many beautiful pictures there. Worth visiting but do take the time to join the Secret Garden tour.
Colorful palace and it reflects the traditional Korean Style of living. It requires some walking to discover more so prepare for it.
This palace is neat to look around...not much on display but the area is nice with some fantastic scenery. Whilst there we learned that it is in the process if being rebuilt and so not much of it at all is actually historic.
"So here goes - I'm just going to be honest - pretty boring. Yes, architecture is interesting, and in a city of modern buildings, certainly a sense of the real Korea. But for me, building after building, without any context. I deliberately didn't read anything about the pace, just so that I could find our more when I was there - so I'm none the wiser."
"It's good place but not great . Very peace and all almost inside is similar everywhere . If u want to know about Korea , you may visit."
The size of the Palace is average but the buildings are quite well maintained . The secret garden though not much to be seen but can see that it was once quite a beautiful one.
This temple and its grounds are lovely. It seems by the amount of tourists that is a must see place. It was a nice quiet day spent strolling around the grounds.
"Very nice and clean, but a lot of walking inside, wear a pair of sneakers. Tourists like us must take a look of this empty palace."
"Traditional, well preserved, very clean and obviously well looked after. Wish I could access more and I wish I could have spent more time here! It is a wonderful place to go and learn about Korea and it's culture and history"
"This palace, like others, provides only a glimpse into what was. Still, worth seeing the size, scale and furnishings. Can be crowded with tourists but the space is big enough not to feel constrained."
"This is one of Seoul's famous palaces, a bit like a miniature Forbidden City. The place has been very well restored, and it's certainly worth a visit. But the fact that the interiors are unfurnished is a bit disappointing.
The highlight is definitely the beautiful Secret Garden. We visited in November, so were treated to the beautiful autumn colours."
"The palace is located in the center of Seoul, so it is easy to get there.
The entrance fee is quiet reasonable likewise other palaces in South Korea.
You could breathe the life of royalties and their servants there.
In addition, there is a remarkable garden inside of the palace.
That is called 'Secret Garden', one of UNESCO's World Heritage sites in the palace.
To visit the garden, it would be better to book the tour in advance since there is a limitation of number of people per each tour.
If you visit there, you will be able to enjoy the small pavilions which is in harmony with beautiful nature.
The nearest subway station is Anguk Station, orange line(line number 3)."
Autumn trees were beautiful. There is a secret garden tour which requires a little bit of walking. The tour group seems a little too big as well
"Our second palace to visit and a must since it is one of UNESCO's World Heritage sites in Korea. Visiting it, we understood why. The buildings are so colorful and well-preserved. We even got to enjoy tea inside one of the rooms near the royal kitchen which had been converted to a cafe.
We did a DIY tour which was not difficult as signages abound and there was sufficient information for all the structures.
We also visited the Biwon (Secret) Garden afterwards. The guided tour was very informative."
"Tip: You can book the secret garden tour a week in advance (I suggest you do so as it's limited to 100 per slot). The English tour starts at 11.30am.

Be at the palace early to roam around and join the 10.30 General Tour (English) around the palace grounds. You will still make it for the 11.30am secret garden tour which takes 1.5 hours.

Following the tours make it so much easier to appreciate and understand the stories behind the buildings. You can either choose to get off Jongno 3 ga station (exit 6) or Anguk station (exit 3) depending on where you stay.

We got the Royal Palace Pass which is 10,000 won and allows us entry to 4 palaces (including Gyeongbokgung) and the Jongmyo Royal Shrine."
"This property was a good tour. They have several English speaking guides and tours throughout the day. The guide was knowledgeable and I recommend you take this tour as the guide had a few free tips that were of interest.

The tour finished in 50 minute and finished just outside the entrance to the secret garden. We didn't have enough time to fit in the secret garden on this trip, but not because of the tour length as it ended near the secret garden about 10 minutes prior to that for starting."
"I found that the other palaces are just as interesting if not more--but the Secret Garden (which is an extra admission) is the highlight of this place. If you go--you must take a walk around the garden. If time is short, I think Gyeongbokgung Palace is more interesting."
Visit this place on a cold windy day. Great scenary with historical houses but most of them is the same.
"You must visit at least one Palace in Korea, once you have done one, well they are pretty much the same and well worth the visit."
This palace was built as asummer residence by the most important Joseon Dynasty in 1405 but it eventually served as the main residence for 270 years when the Japanese ruined the Gyeongbokgung in the late 1500's. The garden must be very pretty in summer.
"We asked Tourist Info Centre to recommend near places where we could appreciate the red leaves and here we came. Entrance was KRW5,000. We didn't pay the price for the Secret Garden which costed KRW8,000.

Apart from the red leaves, we also got to see the palace structure, and some exhibitions.

It was nice to spend the morning here."
"The palace grounds were expansive and the trees and leaves on the grounds were coloured beautifully in shades of red,yellows and orange in Early december. We have signed up for the secret garden tour which proved was great as the guide was very informative on the history and description of the area. The gardens were also equally beautiful with the historical buildings and a backdrop of autumnal flora and fauna. This would definitely be on my must visit list for Seoul.

I would advise visitors to look up secret garden tour timings in their language prior to their visit as you can only enter the secret garden as part of a guided tour group.

The grounds and garden are filled with plenty of steep steps and slopes - would advise those with walking difficulty to give this a pass as it would be hard to move around.

There is only a small shop beside the gift shop offereing coffee and light refreshments - visitors would definitely have to head elsewhere for food."
Some of the other palaces in Seoul can be overwhelmed with people visiting however I found Changdeokgung nice and quiet for better photos. Nice to look around before exploring the traditional village next door :)
"When a went to soul I know I can find to many places to visit, but this temple is a nice place to go"
"I enjoyed visiting this palace especially the Huwon Secret Garden. We joined the japanese tour, better check the english tour schedule in ever. It's great to explore this place."
"Try to get there when they have the changing of the guard ceremony, very colourful, the palace is a very interesting building but try and find a guide that can explain the history."
This was a nice lesson in Korea's history. The changing of the guards was a nice show to see. The museum is nice for the timeline of events.
"Another palace, this one comes with a very nice garden. Must admit most of the palaces in seoul look a bit similar.
The secret garden tour which is seperate so you should book in advance on the internet, cost for garden and palace is 7 euro and with that you get a free english guide, do check the time as the guides on english are not that often but we took the 13:30 tour of the secret garden and caught the 14:30 english tour of palace
Nice thing to do if the weather allows. The garden is nice with 400 year old trees, nice water areas and great for walking on a sunny day"
We liked visiting this palace and specially to see the heating system to keep the rooms warm during winter.
This palace is one of the most famous a-must visit place in Korea. It's still beautiful even it was burnt during Japanese invasion. Its history has remained faithful. You should have come visit this place.
This palace is amazing and it was very easy and felt safe to access even with the recent protests nearby. It is huge so bring your walking shoes. Check the daily activities schedule so you can catch the guard show.
Very well renovated grouping to palace buildings in a very tranquil setting. Several English language tours at reasonable prices every day. And a 'secret garden' that is expansive and impressive. Easy to see the whole thing in 90 minutes. Take a taxi or it's a 7-10 minute walk from the Anguk subway station. And it's a short walk afterwards to the area with the traditional Korean houses. Make a morning of it!
"Lots of walking and steps so not for elderly, mobility impaired or small children. The gardens were to be ""beautiful"" but we went in November and there was just dirt and barren trees. Overall, not that interesting..."
"This palace and all the the gardens and surroundings are really worth the visit.
You should take you time to enjoy the vastness of the place.
Very impressive. You can very easily imagine the life they were living in here.
There is mo way you can miss this visit."
"World Heritage Site of UNESCO. Well done, Koreans! The place is really well maintained. The entrance fee is quite low so accessible for representatives of different layers of the society. I saw many nursery school students here, that shows that Koreans teach their young about the roots of the nation. The architecture of the palaces and other dwellings is purely Korean, so authenticity is well preserved. Recommended for lazy walk in the nice weather. The visitors in the Korean national costumes enter the place for free )))"
"Living nearby, I literally rolled out of bed to catch the English guided tour at 10:30am on Saturday. It was a 5 mins walk & hard to get out of bed with the cold weather. But I am glad I did it. This is my 3rd palace for the week. And though I missed the glorious autumn leaves (I was rewarded at Deoksugung), this palace is not a UNESCO heritage site for nothing. It is the grandest of the 3 palaces I visited (the other being Gyeonbokgung) and it suitably named as a palace. The Korean Tourist Office has done a wonderful job managing my expectations that it is not as grand as China's.

This palace has the history and grandeur.
Our guide was the best guide of all the tours I had. She speaks English with an American accent and it was easy to understand her.

As my tour ends at 11:25pm, I rushed to the Secret Garden's English Tour which starts at 11:30am. Trust me, it was super freezing and I was having second thoughts. Especially when our guide was warning as of the long walk and steps. Then I looked around. There are folks with strollers! I have to press on !! One-third through the tour, at this beautiful part with the pond & the pavilion is.......it started to snow !! Magical !! And the snow got heavier & heavier. I'd never forget this special moment! The last time I experienced this, it was in Nikko Japan, and that was about 10 years ago!

So it you are only in Seoul for a short time, and have to choose ONE to go.....this is the one. It was too cold for me to linger around after the cold. So I hurried back to get my umbrella and to watch to snow falling out of my window before catching authentic lunch at a hanok.

If you are in the area, end your tour with lunch at Gung Hanjeogsik. You need to cross the right traffic light, coming out from main entrance. Walk straight down the first road, then turn left. It's not easy to find, but worth it! I have come to realised, this trip, that having many reviews in TA on a particular restaurant is not necessarily the best. It could have been overly commercialised. It's super! And if you want stretch your visit to this area more, visit the"
We had a lovely afternoon out here while visiting Seoul and the entrance fee is very reasonable. We bought another ticket inside the grounds to visit the gardens. Well worth a visit while in Seoul and we were there on a Thursday which is not as busy a the weekend
"it was the maple season when i went there. Inside the secret garden, it's like walking into a different world, amazingly beautiful!"
"I enjoyed this Palace very much, it was a sprawling beautiful location. We missed the cut off for going into the garden, but I will just have to go again. It's very affordable, especially if you get the special discount for the multiple locations!"
"Greats place to visit if you are looking at the ancient parts of Seoul, suitable for all ages and accessible to most. Close to the main part of the city. You do not need to tour guide but handy to use one if you want all the background information"
"A must visit with beautiful architecture, walking paths and informative tours. Do book ahead for the Secret Garden Tour -- wear good walking shoes! Love the Fall foliage at this time of year, not sure how the garden looks during other seasons though. One UNESCO heritage site ticked!"
"This royal villa, declared UNESCO world heritage and main palace for many kings, is a must see when you visit Seoul.

The entire complex is located in a huge land and it consists in a large number of buildings, all with interesting explanations in order to understand their importance and meaning.

The main entrance of the Palace is located in the southwest area, close to the intersection of Yulgongno (avenue) and Mareunnaegil. It is close to Anguk Metro Station (Line 3)"
Situated within the busy Seoul city. Lovely sight with the maple leaves turning yellow/red. Recommended the best time to visit would be in autumn and don't forget to spend a little more on the tickets to visit the Secret Garden. It would be more meaningful to go with the guides (since you paid for it) as he/she will do some explanation of the different points and the history of buildings.
This is the another heritage palace next to Gyeongbokgung palace in the same toad. Both palaces are easily accessible when you get in through Anguk metro station
"You should visit this palace in autumn especially its secret garden. The view was magnificent. You have to walk a lot, though hence proper shoes is recommended."
"We bought tickets for this palace along with tickets for the secret garden tour. Unfortunately, the tour guide for the secret garden had somewhat stilted English (and was thus a bit difficult to understand) and the tour was quite boring, so we just ventured out on our own after a while.

The palace is humongous so be prepared for a very long walk. Also note there really isn't much food you can purchase within the palace itself except for some drinks, so be prepared for that as well.

The palace does get a bit repetitive at times, although the nicely manicured grounds do make up for it."
"Yes a lot of these palaces are similar; but all a bit different. We really enjoyed the walk and the gardens.It felt a bit less crowded and a bit more traditional than gyeongbokgung. I would recommend it if you want to visit something something a bit more quiet; though make no mistake there will be plenty of tourists.

Very easily accessible by tube. A great weekend outing which took us a couple of hours!"
"It's best to join a tour with an English speaking tour guide like Sunny of the VIP Tours that we booked. She had an excellent explanation of the different buildings and purpose at it is said to be built in harmony with the landscape. there is a lot of walking because of the spacious design including a secret garden. The guide was able to relate what takes place in the different buildings and pavilions and makes one feel that they were part of the ceremonies. The palace is open 9:00 to 18:00 but during winter only up to 17:30. It is also closed on Mondays. Adults pay Won3,000 or a little below $3 and children pay W1,500 . if traveling on your own, you can take the subway or the Bus and join the scheduled tours by the park like English is 10:30 and 14:30... The palace is preserved and restored even after it was destroyed during the Japanese invasion (1592-1598) and after that was used by the monarchy for 270 years. This was preserved until this date for tourism purposes."
"Changdeokgung Palace is a very nice place for a taste of Korean history, a nice escape inside the city. Very relaxing walking, to admire the beautiful nature and to take pictures.
Don't forget visiting the Secret Garden, it is quieter and less crowded because you must book a tour to enter.
Tip : wear your hanbok for free admission but you will have to buy tickets to enter the Secret Garden ( Trust me, would be very worthy !! )"
This is a UNESCO heritage site with some amazing traditional architecture. Well worth a visit. Get there at 9 when it opens to beat the crowds though to be honest it was never as crowded as many top tourist sites around the world these days. So quite refreshing really.
"If you have been to any palace or temple in Japan. This will be boring. The buildings aren't amazing, not as ""grand"". Wife rented a hanbok and got into the palaces for free. Both of us aren't interested in the history, so 2 hours in there mainly taking pics of my wife with the hanbok. If you come to this one, no need to visit the other palace."
"If you're a fan of historical dramas from Korea this is a MUST VISIT place! It looks exactly as it is on the dramas. We went there when it was Chuseok so there we're cultural performances which was really cool. The entrance fee is cheap and if your wear a Hanbok (traditional Korean clothes) which you can rent in stores outside the palace, your entrance fee is waived. Next time, I wanna try going there at night."
"Rented the audio guide and took a guided tour of the Secret Garden as well.Very interesting facts about the palace's history and sights,rituals of the people such as floor heating were revealed by our guide.Sadly,I couldn't visit the Geyongbokgung Palace but this made up for it somehow.
The Quen's,King's and the Prince's palace were very mesmerising.
Do remember,the Secert Garden has an additional fee and times to be visited with an English guide."
"This is a series of beautiful buildings and a palace where the royal family lived. Its architecture blends with the surrounding nature and landscape. The Palace is where the kings dealt with state affairs. All the buildings are decorated and made of wood and have a stone platform. Being of wood, they have been damaged by fires during the centuries and rebuilt. The whole park is quite big and includes ponds and many tress, some of which seemed very old."
"There is a secret garden in this palace. This palace is less crowded than gyeong bok gong. Visitors should plan the trip ahead with perfect timing for guided tour.
Entrance fee to palace:3000won (free for those with hanbok)
Entrance fee to secret garden:5000won
Definitely worth a visit!!"
"Beautiful nature, very relaxing walking, good place to think, to write, to admire the nature, to take pictures, and be in contact with yourself."
"So much into Korean royalty history. So interesting to see the King's palace and the Queen's palace, how they rule and what their restrictions are. The architecture and very detailed designs of the palace are impressive. They have maintained these sites so well without altering the original set-up. When you're in Seoul, at least visit one of these heritage sites. This requires lots of walking and climbing of stairs. You need need to be fit though but good walking tour."
"Palaces are a must-visit attractions when we are in Seoul, Korea!
We are allowed to snap photos in the palaces. Some of the palaces does charge nominal fees but most of them are FOC."
If your going to tour one of the palaces make it this one. Its the biggest and most scenic I would say. Make sure to time it properly so you can watch one or two of the guard changing ceremonies. Spend some time walking around and then relax a little by the absolutely stunning pond in the compound. Great way to spend a couple hours.
Very cultural place to visit and envision how it was during the era of dynasties. Would recommend visiting this massive palace
"Impressive! Whole palace complex is big enough for at least 1,5 hour of walking around it. For me - it looks amazing. Just like from old kung-foo movies but it's real. There is plenty of tourist information in front of every pagoda so you can really learn a lot about the place.
You can have a cup of traditional tea inside and I strongly recommend to have one."
"This palace is so so beautiful in the spring with cherry blossoms and in the autumn. You can visit this palace with the Huwon garden (3,000KRW for entrance fee and 5,000KRW for the garden admission fee)."
"Beautiful palace, cheap price and fantastic location. Go go Insadong and Bokchon village after and then have lunch or dinner!"
"Very attractive palace buildings with interesting architecture and interiors making a pleasant change from temple visiting. But don't expect to have the place to yourself. It was very busy, but this added to the character as many were in national costumes.
Due to time restraints we were not able to visit the secret garden, which is a shame as photos we have seen make it look well worth visiting too.
Would recommend having a local guide to make the most of your visit as there is much to understand."
"It's very impressive with all the different sections and buildings.Make sure you visit the palaces and the secret garden with their guide tours as the information provided are very useful and interesting.
Best time of the year to visit is in autumn and have your camera ready to take plenty of photos."
Great location to gain insights into the history of Korea. Need a good guide to introduce the area and bring history to life.
"Interesting palace, and different from the others in the vicinity. As we entered two volunteers offered to give us an English guided tour, which was really interesting. We didn't get to see the secret garden unfortunately - an excuse to go back!"
Very impressive palace grounds. Have visited in two separate trips. Very expansive. Only issue was long ticket lines on Sunday.
Basically this palace has been reconstructed from the ground up which signify the importance of history of this place to South Koreans. There are many volunteer tour guides to guide you the significance of each building.
"This palace looks like other palaces close to it, mid of november would be nice to visit, especially it's secret garden, you can see colorful leaves there."
"The palace ground is huge, but retained the old Josheon dynasty feel. A site where they shot some of the scenes for the famous Jewel In the Palace Korean drama. Worth visiting - I reckon it is better than Geongbokgung Palace."
"I visited Secret Garden which is located in the back side of this palace. It is called ""Bi-won"" in Korean, and which means ""Secret Garden"" because this place was allowed to special persons only in Chosun Dynasty.
English speaking guides are available. There are several time section and Koreans can't join English section without foreigners company. Secret Garden is available only visitors who reserve it in advance."
Beautiful views! A must see if you're in Seoul. The exchange of the guards was a sight to see! Fun for everyone not just for kids.
"It's a great place and it's well preserved. It remains intact and is situated in front of the Blue House, and behind the statue of King Sejong. If you want to know more about South Korea's history, this is the way to go.

It only took us a 3-5 min. Walk from our guesthouse, (Guesthouse Korea). There was a performance for like every 20 mins or so? Where performers dress up as the way that people dressed before and did the rituals etc. To depict the old times. At the end of the ceremony, some performers stand outside the palace and station there where you can take a picture with them (Proper manners and gestures should be observed. They'll feel violated if you get touchy with them.)

Inside, I can say that the overall palace is well-maintained. The comfort rooms are also great. Once you get out, you will see the front of the Blue House, you can also take a stroll in the side walks to enjoy the streets of Korea while enjoying the views of the falling leaves of the tree's"
Elegant and understated. The architecture is similar to Gyeongbokgung palace with some slight differences.
"This place is massive. You can spend the whole day in this beautiful palace. Secret Garden and an inner attraction of the compound however needs additional charges/payments aside from the entrance fee. Bring a camera because this place is one beautiful site of Seoul, South Korea."
"Interesting, and one needs some time to plan out your journey to these tourist attraction spots. But then, one must prepare to do some walking on foot. Mindful of the day of the week that some of these places may be closed to visitors."
"According to UNESCO, this biwon or secret garden situated within changdeokgung is a treasure because the landscaping is a natural occurrence. The park is built to preserve the natural landscaping in this enclosed area. According to the tour guide, the palace is a smaller place built strategically for emergency purposes. In case of plague, war, fire or any disaster, Changdeokgung is a backup."
"Changdeokgung Palace popular with the Secret Garden tour. the palace looks similar to palaces in Gyeongbokgung Palace. but the Secret Garden is a different view. to enter the garden, you need to follow the tour, held with the schedule. just come at the ticket booth of Changdeokgung, and see the schedule there. it have tour guide in English. really good!"
"For me, visiting Seoul has been a lot of hustle and bustle. The Palace and Gardens were still very busy but visiting provided a but of respite from the crowds of Insadong.

Changdeokgung is one of four palaces (plus a shrine) in the area but is the only one that has a separate tour of the gardens. The secret garden area is by tour only (large groups-limited to 100 per tour) and they have different times with different languages. For entrance plus the garden tour it is 8000 won, but for only 10,000 won you can get a palace pass to visit the other 4 locations within 3 months of purchase. Definitely get the pass! The other four locations included are Gyeonbokgung palace, Changgyeonggung palace, Deoksung Palace and the Jongmyo Shrine.

My husband and I went on an afternoon English tour on a Saturday afternoon. The guide provided insight into how the royal family lived and used each of the buildings within the garden area and spoke english very clearly. The fall foliage makes it an excellent time to visit the gardens with a wide variety of trees changing. I believe the tour lasts about an hour and a half and does have steep hills to walk up.

Other than the garden tour, the palace is mostly just open space. The buildings themselves are beautiful and historically interesting, but there isn't a whole lot going on other than the buildings themselves. You will likely see many visitors dressed up in traditional Korean Hanbok taking photos within the palace. If you'd like, any places in the area rent these (I know I saw a few in the Insadong market)

My favorite thing about visiting the palaces is that they are literally right in the middle of the city. The city grew around the palaces so it is an interesting juxtaposition of the old and new. Definitely worth a visit- if you have to choose just one palace I'd pick Changdeokgung.

By Metro get off at Anguk Station and follow exit signs for ""Changdeokgung Palace"" When you exit, continue straight a few blocks and you'll walk right into it on your left."
Part of the tour was a visit to Changdeokung Palace. Its design is not as detailed and intricate as that of Gyeongbokgung. It is much simpler and there were few people who visited this palace. Considered as Changdeokgung Palace was recognized as a World Cultural Heritage site by the UNESCO World Cultural Heritage Committee.
"If visiting the Secret Garden, it is quieter and less crowded than Gyeongbukgong because you must book a tour to enter. In my opinion, this is a top site to visit in Seoul. The garden is small but pretty and tranquil. It does not compare at all in terms of splendor or grandeur to the imperial gardens of China, but does have its own unique flavor. It is clean and well-preserved. If you can, plan to spend a bit of time relaxing there. There are a number of small pavilions set up with books there to chill. A very nice touch. wear your hanbok for free admission."
"One of the 5 big palaces in Seoul. For me the best one. Its strongly recommended to buy combined ticket for all the palaces (5) - 10 000 W and try the guided tour. Its free, all guides speak fluent english and explain all that you can see. There are separate tours for palace and the secret garden. There are separate tickets for palace and secret garden (unless you buy combined ticket - then you have it all in one)."
"Changdeokgung Palace is a very nice place for a taste of Korean history. If you love to wear a Hanbok, this place is also a must visit to take nice photos with you wearing the traditional attire of Koreans. It's kinda hot so going in the afternoon is highly suggested. =)"
This palace is designated as a world heritage cultural site for good reason. Take the tour to find out how it became designated as such and for added pleasure go to the Secret Garden.
The secret garden is definitely worth exploring. It has nice leafy gardens and nice little pavilions. The tranquility make the visit very intimate. A bit of difference from the Gyeongbukgong.
"All the palaces in Seoul are alike. If you are not a specializing in korean history than visit one or two will be enough. This one one of the most famous one. It has two parts palaces and garden. For the garden you require separate ticket - be careful and ask in advance in ticket office, you only can access garden like a part of free guided tour but you have to purchase ticket first and if you will stack in the queue you are risking to be late for the tour. Then you will not be able to enter till the next tour (which will be in 2 hours). There are also free guided tours for buildings parts - which is nice because otherwise you will be just looking on many empty buildings."
"Was fortunate enough to visit during the evening, as a foreigner could buy a ticket (only 500 reserved for foreigners). Great event with many Korean people in traditional dress (understood that provides them free entrance). Very enchanting"
"Spent a few hours wandering the gardens and buildings of this site - not as 'big' as its brother down the road, but I thought the gardens were better to view. Autumn was stunning in the colour changes and there was certainly plenty to see and do. Well worth it."
Vey calm place. Buy the secret garden ticket and you will never regret it. It is like enter a green heaven there with fresh atmosphere. I would stay there for hours just to enjoy breathing.
Spent a couple of hours here straight after arriving. Very pleasant and affordable. Lots to see and very interesting. Lots of young Korean girls and boys wandering around in traditional costume and happy to have pic's taken.
"If you want to see the guard changing ceremony, go early in the morning (around 8:30 AM). The place is huge.. so plan accordingly.."
This palace is really beautiful and peaceful. It is possible to see many Korean visitors with their traditional Korean dresses and that is absolutely lovely. It is a must see in Seoul.
"This is such a beautiful palace, and it's secret garden is just extraordinary. Take the guided garden tour which transports you back to the time of the king and his family. You could imagine the royal family strolling in this wonderful garden. The fall colors just started during my visit. Can imagine it's exquisiteness in full fall colors.
This is also the only palace where they let you sit inside some of the palace building and enjoy the serenity of its surroundings."
"I really enjoyed the fact that this palace was within the city and near a train station. It was a relaxing walk in the palace - although most of the relics are reconstructed, it still gives a good idea of how life was in the past! My family and I decided to take the Secret Garden tour. It is really beautiful and great for photo taking."
"I stayed at a hostel just 200m away from this place so I could come in in early morning and stayed til closed, with visited to Secret Garden. The palace is really big so, I really liked to take my time to enjoy and take photos, read information, relax and watch the locals, children in their tradition dress.

The palace is very big, well preserved. A lot of small garden, areas... if you can ask for the map it will be very helpful. The buildings, houses, temples, gates, halls... are quite impressive. Peaceful after all the tourists have left.

I left the Secret Garden, separate ticket, til 1400, after I saw the palace. It was just me. But in the late afternoon when all the tourists went home, and a lot of locals, couples would be there in their traditional dress. Really enjoyable time, quite place to see the true tranquillity of the place.

Ask the locals for photographs, they are more than welcome to let you do it and offer to take photo for them too :)"
"This palace is nothing short of amazing, great phototaking views all around. It's an approximate 2.0km walk from the Gyeongbokgong Palace so you can choose to do palace-hopping if you're in the mood (don't go on Tuesdays though as Gyeongbokgong is closed). Furthermore, if you're in a Hanbok, admission is free!"
"I loved the architecture, the layout of the land and of course the history of the Palace. It just seemed a bit dusty and it is very inaccessible by wheelchair or stroller even though there are ramps."
"This palace is well-preserved. I quite large and not famous for tourist like Gyeongbokgung palace. the secret garden is very good and neat. you don't need to go with the tour guide, it's more peaceful and have time to relax :)"
"We went to Seoul in June, it was quite hot, I had high expectations about Seoul but so far it was just an average trip that didn't have much attraction. We went to Changdeokgung Palace. I like places with history and story attached to it. I enjoyed the food but didn't love it. I guess enjoying/loving your travel will depend on the places that you go. So maybe next time I will try the outskirts of Seoul."
"This palace is the larger of the two in central Seoul. It has enough ground to take up a few hours walking around. The secret garden area is also a great visit and worth the extra money. It is incredibly cheap to visit the palaces in Seoul, so seeing at least one is a good idea."
"A must see place. Built of 3 major attractions: 2 Palaces and 1 secret garden. You will pay 9,000 won to gain entry to all 3 and it's worth it.
Have fun."
Changdeokgung is a popular tourist spot. Its Secret Garden is hotly sought after in autumn; booking of entry for the Secret Garden of Changdeokgung is via internet (6 days in advance) and all the places will be taken up within an hour or so (booking starting at 10:00 local time). Changdeokgung itself is quite typical but the Secret Garden looks more ancient and has retained much of the original character (despite the re-built). It is a delight to visit the Secret Garden to experience the absolute tranquility and beauty of an ancient garden.
"Well preserved and the main draw is the beautiful 'secret garden' where the Royal family members go to to relax and entertain. The ponds, pavilions and trees come out beautifully in photos.

If you intend to visit more than one Palace it is best to buy the Combination Ticket of 10,000 won as the fee to enter Changdeokgung is 3,000 won and another 5,000 for entry into the secret garden."
"The secret garden tour of the palace is exceptionally popular during the Autumn season, so don't forget to make a reservation in advance!"
"We visit this palace on October. It was very beautiful, but they say it will be 100 times better in the fall (late October to November) when all the leaves turn to yellow.
Prepare to walk a lot as this place is very big"
"This is a beautiful palace that you are free to explore at your own pace for just $1. The buildings are well maintained and there are several styles to see. Don't miss the concubines area to enjoy some different designs. I couldn't get into see the secret garden as a tour needs to be booked (It takes more than an hour to see it). Even without the garden, it was a lovely place to stroll. We spend an hour or so, and it was enough time.
Theres a small coffee shop/gift shop which is a great place to get a drink (we had ginger ice tea and loved it) and then sit inside or out and just enjoy this peaceful place."
"be sure to do the secret garden -- there are regular tours in English. All signs are in Korean, English, Chinese, and Japanese."
"make sure you do the secret garden walk!
we had a wonderful time!
a bit hilly but we managed a buggy fine"
"The palace is lovely, but the gardens are the real attraction. You do have to buy an extra ticket to view the gardens but it's inexpensive. Once inside wander the paths and you'll find the various gardens, each with their own charm. There are some nice places to sit and take everything on as well."
"This vast palace complex is packed with beautiful buildings that would be massive draws by themselves in any other city in the world. The concentration of stunning architecture, huge courtyards and beautiful gardens is just wonderful. There are larger single temples in many places but here it's on an incredible scale I've not seen before. And it costs less than £2.50 to visit! Also, I went on a Monday afternoon and saw a military parade in traditional dress too, which was great."
"At 10am promptly every morning you can watch the Changing of the Guard ceremony. Colorful, and not too crowded, we thoroughly enjoyed the pomp and ceremony. Lots of youngsters wearing national costume to the event ( apparently you can rent them nearby for a couple of hours for a small fee and entry to the Palace will then be free), and lots of buses dropping off groups of school children. Well worth a visit."
"Easily access by subway ( Angguk station, exit 3). Entrance fee was 3k won and secret garden was 5k won. Closed on Monday. You can see many locals and tourist wore hanbok. Worth to come."
"Any one who's loves history.
Specially the eastern history.
They should come to this place
I recommend it when weather is nice.
There's a lot of walking the place is huge.
So be carful. And make 6 hours to this amazing field."
It is a great place to just walk around like 1-2 hours was enough for me. Also you can go to the other palace next to it where the elder leaders residence was.
"This palace is open at night for certain period of the year. It used to be at the center of heavy and noisy traffic with a zoo. Now it is relatively quieter neighborhood. Without a zoo. One amazing development is all the walkways are accessible to wheelchairs. It opens at 7 at night. As it is less popular than another palace in downtown, it is less hubbub. You can enjoy a great walk feeling the spring air. No street vendors. Only some security guards as guiders. It was always there, you can find. I hope more spaces would be open and it would be connected to Secret Garden and Royal Family Garden. It would be then two-hour walk. As of now, it was about 30 minutes walk."
"Almost gave this place a miss. Am glad I didn't. Enjoy the experience, in particular the morning guard changing session which was an eye opener for me."
"One if the main ancient temples in Seoul. Very cheap entrance fee. Good location in Seoul, not far from other temples."
"The exterior is not as spacious and grand as Gueongbokgung. However, it's a prettier palace with more trees and a mysterious feel. Go visit the secret garden for a stroll (5000Won per entry) We had a great time enjoying the scenery and breeze inside. There are slopes and much steps at the end of the walk and not suitable for person with walking inconvenience."
"This palace is not as big as the other one in Seoul but is as nice or better. Walk in to the palace and its grounds with a nice lake, it also hosts a nice museum."
A nice place which you should go visit one for taking pictures. Also interesting to see the guards changing shift
"Pros: UNESCO world heritage site, beautiful architecture and grounds, free tours in multiple languages
Cons: Can be crowded (especially with school groups), historical perspective is missed without the tour guide explanations, lots of walking.

I visited the palace on an afternoon in October; the weather was perfect for a few hours outside. Although there were quite a few school groups there, I didn't have to wait to take the tours in English. I purchased the combined ticket (palace &a secret garden) for 8,000 won - a bargain in my opinion.

The architecture was really neat, from the designs and colors to the building sizes and concepts. The tour guides did a great job of explaining the little details that you might overlook; for example, I would never have guessed that the larger doorways were only for the emperor, while the smaller doorways were for the government officials and others - using those smaller doorways required the individuals to ""bow"" as the entered.

Personally, while I enjoyed the palace grounds, I liked the secret garden better; but this was due in part to the excellent tour guide and her details on how it was used by the emperors. The explanations and history changed the experience, bringing the buildings to life as one considers what it must have been like in the garden hundreds of years ago. I did note that the tour moves at a fairly set pace, and it is better if you focus on staying with the guide so you can see and hear her details - you can always walk back through areas at your own pace then the tour is over."
Beautiful palace and so many stories to unfold. Rated the most beautiful palace out of the 5 grand palace.
The palace is a great place to see Korean history. There is a changing of the guard that is a must see. Don't know if they are there all the time but there were kids dressed in traditional clothes. Fun to take pics with. There is an entrance fee into the back of the grounds. Did not have the time so did not go in further. A must see!
Went to the secret garden tour. Must visit when you go to this place. Lot of walking involved. Wear comfortable footwear.
"It's 3,000W to get in then another 5,000W for the secret garden tour. A nice bunch of buildings but to be honest A LOT of it is inaccessible (you can only look from the outside), there isn't too much in between (the grounds feel sparse), and of course so little of it is original. A huge number of people come here each day so I wouldn't call it peaceful but an ok place to visit if it's the only palace you go to while in Seoul."
"We visited Changdeokgung palace on a Sunday around 10am and the crowds have fully yet to arrive. A great time to be there since there is very little shade to beat the heat or cover you from the rain.
There are several palaces as you continue to walk inside. There is a small fee to get inside but you will be greeted with a relaxing lotus pond towards the end of the palace."
"The palace is actually a complex of buildings which is very nice to visit. Inside there is an additional palace for which an extra ticket is required. I had not planned to visit it and indeed did not. Inside there is also the Secret Garden, also additional ticket. I took it and was not impressed. Would recommend to skip."
"I visited on a Wednesday. Contrary to the information in some other reviews, there are many secret garden tours available, including 4 per day in English (this depends on the time of year; see the palace website for full details). Currently, the tours take 200 people instead of the palace website stated 100, this may have been due to Chinese National Day. 50 tickets can be booked ahead and the rest are claimed at the palace. I was able to purchase tickets at 11:15 for the 11:30 tour.

As for the palace itself, very nice and the layout is very different from palaces I've seen before. While some of the layout is perpendicular building and walkway placement, much of it is off at odd angles to meld seamlessly with the natural terrain. This was a nice contrast to the forbidden city in Beijing. The garden tour is definitely worth the time (90 minutes). The tour guide has some useful information and the tour group quickly dwindles to a reasonable size, but you're free to leave the tour guide from the start if you like to do your own thing."
Stunning palace and very ornate. It is walking distance between two other palaces and the area is easily accessible by metro train.
"As with all my reviews to sights in Seoul I will preface this by advising visitors to carefully check opening days and times and whether timed entry tickets are needed to access certain parts of the attraction (such as the Secret Garden here) and also the times for booking guided tours in their language of preference – bearing in mind that numbers can be limited

The buildings in the main palace area are impressive in their size and magnificence - highly restored and in some cases I guess recreations

The entrance ticket does not allow access to the Secret Garden a separate timed ticket has to be obtained (and can be pre booked online). You pick a time that coincides with your preferred language (numbers are limited to 30 per tour) Luckily you do not have to stick with the tour guide - but can wander off and look around the garden independently. It covers an immense area and is hilly in parts. Even with a limit on numbers it does get very crowded - especially with noisy school parties - so not such a ""secret""!!

Everything was well maintained with some of the areas being restored. Throughout the site visitor amenities are excellent"
"Was expecting more I guess, but the Secret garden is really just a park, not much of a garden. Didn't find it worth the time."
"Maybe, there is no fun if there is no interest in Korean films.
I do not know whether there is worth a look to pay money.
Chinese and does Mase Japanese city council."
All the buildings are conserved and maintained very well. It's a really good place for those who want to learn about Korean history. There were groups of school kids maybe on school trip.
I think that I would have enjoyed this more with a tour guide instead of relying on what I could find on the internet. I was surprised that although centrally located the palace and grounds are vast- be prepared to walk- this is not a place to pop in and visit in 10 minutes
"Different from Gyeongbokgung with the layout of the buildings done in such a way as to blend with the topography, this is a beautiful place. I visited both here and Gyeongbokgung and if you have time for only one of the two, this is the one. Excellent free tours in English.
Entrance is a frankly ridiculous 3000 won, and a small guide book at 500 won can surely hardly cover the printing cost.
Plan your visit to make sure that you get the tour of the Huwon secret gardens. Twice the size of the palace area, these are just stunning but can only be visited as part of a tour, with numbers limited, and costs a further 5000 won (buy both tickets at the same time). Be aware that there is walking involved, not all of it flat, and the tour takes a little time. The palace tour will finish in time for the Huwon tour, and close to where it starts.
I got the 10.30 palace tour and the 11.30 Huwon tour and was finished at 13.00."
"This review is the Palace only, we have not been to the Secret Garden, which looks better.

Perhaps I'm a cultural / history heathen or jaded from too many palaces, but I found this palace bland. It was like a virtual reality, a blank canvas waiting for action and features. It was also very similar to the Gyeonbok Palace

For me it was a modern building, a replica of something that may have been on the site. It would have also benefited from some grass."
"Unfortunately I came over too early in Autumn. The leaves were still green and didnt get to see the red fall leaves season which would have made it more beautiful.

To join huwon secret garden tour, head to the secret garden counter to buy the tickets separately for a set tour time. the tour is availabe in english, korean, japanese and chinese. normally, you can only go in with a tour. But this time they allowed visitors to roam away from the tour group giving more time and privacy to take selfies without the crowd in the background.

Changdeokgung palace itself was pretty impressive especially if u watch a lot of period K-Dramas.
More impressive than Gyeongbokgung palace in my opinion.

If you're planning to visit all the palaces and huwon secret garden tour, do get the combination passes for only 10,000won. More value in my opinion."
"The palace is nice, but the gardens are outstanding. If you have a chance to tour both, allow for extra time. The opening hours for palace and garden are different."
"We did the 90-min Secret Garden tour as the website stated that it was required in order to enter. When we arrived, we were informed that they now have an option of walking around on your own. We love to learn about what we are looking at so opted to stay with the tour, as did about 70 other people. The guide was in a hurry to cover everything and began commentary before half of the large group had caught up to each location. So it became frustrating to have to run to the front of the group in order to hear the guide. It might've been more pleasurable to avoid this and just amble around on our own. The palace was impressive. Unfortunately, our small group was not interested in any other tour after the Secret Garden. So, if I had a do-over, I would skip the secret garden tour and go for the palace tour. And I would rent one of the traditional dresses from nearby Bukchon to enter for free. Of the two palaces, I like Gyeongbokung better."
"Yes, join the city tour for free!
Add 10.00 and you get a traditional korean lunch.
The palace itself is huge, some stairs, not handicapped accessible.
Interesting history of an ancient culture.
I wish they have some handouts in different languages since some of the tour guides doesn't speak fluent English."
"This is a beautiful palace, very easy to visit if you are in the insa-dong/bukchon area. It closes at 5pm (I believe) so make sure to check hours before visiting. There's many places around the palacs that will rent you traditional Korean clothing (hanbok) which makes for a fun and memorable photo opportunities!"
"Very beautiful palace with a secret garden(separate ticket needed, giuded tour only with freindly giudes who speak English fluently). A good souvenir shop with refreshments and rest rooms."
"We arrived at 9am to ensure we had a place on the 2.30pm Secret Garden Tour (only 50 places per tour available on the day). We then spent the morning at Bukchon Village which is an easy walk away and definitely worth the visit. Palace & Gardens were beautiful and the Garden Tour was a welcome relief from the afternoon sun as it is mostly shaded. Our tour guide was very informative and spoke excellent English.

Definitely a must when visiting Seoul."
We attended the 10.30am free English guided tour and it was very informative. We then went to the 11.30 Secret Garden tour - good but we abandonded half way through to make another engagement - beautiful gardens.
"We saw the changing of the guard which was a lovely sight,we also got to dress up in national costume and have our photos taken with the guards."
I didn't pay the entrance fee 3000 KRW (korean won) because it's free on Wednesday of the last week of the months. All palaces are free except the secret garden (5000 KRW) that is behind the changdeokgung. It takes around hour to finish the tour of the palace.
"This palace is great and less tourist packed than Gyeongbokgung Palace.
Should be visited along with Gyeongbokgung and Bukchok Hanok village sinse they are all close to each other

If you really are someone who likes to walk I would recommend the following route.
Start from Gwanghwamun station (or City hall station and pass Gwanghwamun gate) - Gwanghwamun Square -Gwanghwamun Gate - Gyeongbokgung Palace -The folk museum of korea - Bukchok Hanok village - Changdeokgung Palace - Insadong - Cheonggyecheon Stream - Gwanghwamun station."
"We visited this Palace first and glad we did so as Gyeongbokgung Palace is more impressive. Entrance fee is 3000 won and does not include entry into the secret garden. However as we did not want a guided tour for 90 minutes we didn't pay for this. There is a Palace bundle for 10,000 won if you were looking to go to Gyeongbokgung and 2 other palaces. Entry is free for those in traditional Korean outfits and it was nice to see so many dressed in these outfits.

The Palace was rebuilt so it looks in good condition and modernish. It is a good place to while away an hour or two and get an idea of the history at a very cheap price."
It sits on several acres and contains over 11o buildings. I was blessed enough to get the free English tour. A MUST SEE.
"Palace was a nice structure with peaceful,grounds. Not exactly ancient but does show the character and shows the pan Asian fertilization"
"Well preserved and in good balance with nature and city, you should visit it.
Take care to not come when schools are present."
"Changdeokgung seems like a smaller version of Gyeongbokgung. As a secondary palace, it pales in comparison to the grandeur and majesty of Gyeongbokgung. However, what sets it apart from the main palace complex is that enclosed in it is Huwon or The Secret Garden. For me, that gives you enough reason to add this to your must-see attractions.

Don't miss out on the guided tour specifically meant for Huwon. It's quite lengthy at 90 minutes and involves some trekking but the captivating serenity of this garden; and hearing anecdotes about the Korean monarchs who frequent the garden would make it worth the trouble!"
"If you have limited time.. Or even just don't want to walk about alot, just visit Gyeongbokgung palace. This one is similar but Gyeongbokgung had more to offer."
I really like the architecture of these ancient palaces. Another thing that might be nice to see is the change of the guards. Always a nice show of itself.
"Which is smaller than gyeongbok palace but it's beautiful palace! Inside the complex, you can find Huwon, UNESCO site! That is really beautiful and you can find the finest scenery of old korean building and nature together! they are harmonized! Plus, you can hear awesome explanation from special tour guide! She was friendly and knowlegable about Korean history!
For tips to visit here, elderly is not good here, need to walk at least 2hours for changdeok palce and Huwon"
"It was smaller than Gyeongbok palace, which I love more than it
Because it's cozy and has more tree and good ambiance! Especially behind the palace complex, there's rear garden which was really beatiful! Eventhough it's quite long walk with special tour guide working in Changdeok palace, it's worth to do it!"
"This palace has definitely more buildings to visit than Gyeongbokgung, but here you do not have any change of guards ceremony to watch. I found the visit not really exciting, as the buildings look like very similar as the ones in Gyeongbokgung."
"Changdeokgung Palace is located not far away from both Anguk station and Jongnosam-ga metro staion. It is 15 minutes walk. The palace is vast and has 2 sections, the Main Palace and the Secret Garden. Both have its entrance fee. Visiting this world heritage complex needs 2 hours walk around. It is a beautiful place to visit."
"Different to Gyeongbukgung Palace, in that the architecture seems less grand and imposing, but still worth visiting for its beautiful grounds. The gardens within the grounds are lush and beautiful & I would recommend buying the inexpensive guide book from the front gate if you can't make the tour times."
"the palace was amazing and magnificent ,we took a photos all over the palace ,you need at least 3 hours to see the palace details ,it was good experience to have a look for the Korean historical place"
"This was an insightful outing. Nice to visit and learn of anther culture, time, place etc. A good walk in the fresh air as well."
Great experience..with historic background...the near muesum is really helpful to know about the korean history
"My first time to visit Korea's palace and it was amazing. We took a lot of pictures at the entrance as there was some men who wearing the tradition Korean customs. It was a pity that we didn't spend much time at the palace and wish to try the Korean customs. We also didn't have time to visit the secret garden. For me, I will visit this palace next time."
"The real attraction of Changdeokgung is the Secret Garden. The palace itself was not as fascinating to us as Gyeongbokgung or Deoksugung which had costumed actors on site and changing of the guard pageantry. We visited Changdeokgung on a Sunday morning. No performers were in costume, although quite a few locals visiting were in colorful traditional Korean attire.

An English-speaking guide took us on a tour of the buildings which were interesting, but the Secret Garden tour was the real attraction. It's best to make reservations at least 24 hours in advance for the Secret Garden tour. We managed to see the palace grounds at 10:30am, followed immediately by the garden tour at 11:30am. The walled garden is beautifully landscaped with water features, trees, flowers, and Korean-style buildings and pagodas. The royal family spent their leisure time here, so every aspect of the garden is well-planned. The first 45 minutes of the walk is easy, the second half apparently ""more athletic"" we were told by the guide, so we decided to take it easy at go back at the halfway point.

Cost is 3,000 KRW for the palace and 5,000 KRW for the garden."
"There are a few palaces in Seoul. This palace is near some other places of interest such as Bukchon village and Insadong. So, why would we skip this when we were also visiting other attractions nearby?"
"You need to arrive fairly early if you want to do the secret garden tour after the palace tour. English-speaking guides take the tour around the palace at 10.30am and the secret garden tour kicks off at 11.30am. We turned up a bit late so although we had the palace tour, the garden tour was sold out and we had to wait until 1.30pm for that. Luckily our hotel was very near so we nipped back there as there isn't really another two hours of activity once you have toured the palace. The talk was very good at giving an insight into court life, meaning when we later went to Gyeongbokgung Palace we didn't feel it necessary to join a guided tour. Word of warning to the infirm, the garden tour has some quite steep climbs and quite a lot of older and more overweight vistors found the pace a bit intense, especially in the heat. It's also worth buying the four-palace pass if you intend to visit all the palaces in Seoul. We only did these two, but I'd recommend them both. Gyeongbokgung is much bigger and also contains two fantastic museums. A real must visit."
A wonderful place to wander around a learn about the history of Korea. Come early in the morning to avoid crowds and to take the best pictures.
"Definitely worth visiting if you are in Seoul. The architecture is amazing and there are lots of things to see, so make sure you have some time up your sleeves to really wander around and see everything you can. There are a lot of people visiting too though so I suggest going early in the morning or in the late afternoon."
"If you'd like a real life behind the scenes glimpse of the royal palace's gardens, I highly recommend purchasing a ticket for the Huwon Tour (5000 won for an adult). However, you must first purchase an entry ticket for Changdeokgung itself.

I was late to the free Changdeokgung tour, so after buying my Changdeokgung+Huwon tour tickets, I quickly looked at the palaces in Changdeokgung and then hurried over to star the Huwon tour.

Very lovely and well maintained, and it's fun seeing that even back then, the royals appreciated nature and art."
"I enjoyed visiting this gorgeous palace. It has so much architecture and history! The day we went was free entrance and we only had to pay for the English-guided garden tour which lasted an hour. When visiting you can see some Koreans dressed in traditional clothes. It can be very humid and hot so stay hydrated! Also, you can take beautiful pictures so I recommend bringing your best camera. Highly recommended if you are in the area!!!"
When you're in Seoul you should see this palace. It's in the heart of Seoul and close to many other things.
"Changdeokgung Palace is set within a large park in Jongno-gu in Seoul. It is one of the “Five Grand Palaces” built by the kings during the Joseon Dynasty. And as such, it was the principal palace for many of the Joseon kings and a 600-year-old UNESCO World Heritage Site.

We were here for a visit as part of our full day city tour. We arrived at around 9.30am and stayed there for slightly over an hour. It was not crowded when we arrived (perhaps it was still early) and our admission fees had been included in our package tour. But I understand that the admission fee is 3,000 won per adult.

The palace ground was massive, with many ""interlinked"" palace buildings from one to another with a big open compound. Of course what was interesting was the ancient style of architectural design and to some extent, similar to the Chinese style. According to our guide, both ancient China and Korea were good allies and thus the country had some influences from the Chinese culture. (in fact, on the roof top of some buildings were designs of the Chinese classic novel, Journey to the West, with the Monkey God, the Tripitaka Master etc, cool!)

Maintenance and conservation work of the buildings had been done here by the city authorities. So we walked from one building to another, with some being able to enter or taking a look from outside on the interior structure of the palaces, such as the King's chair and office, paintings etc!

Along the way, we also saw some people wearing the traditional Korean Hanbok costumes, very nice, colourful and lovely~ And you are keen, you can try them out too!

As we need to visit several attractions in our tour, we were not able to stay to visit the Secret Gardens which according to our guide, was very beautiful and nice!

For us, the visit here was generally fine and interesting to learn about the ancient culture of Korea though we would love to see more like in Gyeongbukgung Palace. Weather was very sunny and warm and do remember to bring along an umbrella, hat and drinking water.

Well, if you are planning to visit some palaces in your trip here, Changdeokgung Palace is also a good option besides the Gyeongbukgung, though the latter has much more to see, besides the buildings and gardens, bigger, there is also an ancient ""change of guard"" ceremony.

But do take note that the former is closed on Mondays and the latter is closed on Tuesdays!"
"We visited the Secret Garden, and we had the most loveliest guide, Ms Yoon! We chatted a lots after the tour and she was very interested about our home country and our view about Korea.
Secret Garden tour is included in the palace pass, but you need to get a separate ticket before entry at the ticket counter near the gates. This is because the tour holds only 50 people at a time and there are language options (English, Korean, Chinese and if I remember correctly Japanese). Palace pass (tickets for all 5 main palace areas+Secret Garden) is 10,000 won."
"It is a very charming place, the little lake with white water lily. Well maintained place. You have chance to try their traditional dress for photo as well which was fun. I love the architect of this place very much"
Interesting tour but be sure to have a guide if you want to get the most out of it. Lots of teens wearing traditional clothes that like having their picture taken.
"It is good maintained, large, can let you feel the background of The country. I like Vietnam palace more so that I rate 3 points for it."
Excellent example of royal architecture for the Joseon period. Well worth visiting to soak up the historical atmosphere and to see how royalty lived.
"You wont need too much time here , just a overall look not more than 30 minutes.
This is the most important sign of seoul when you visit .
Great place for history lovers.
You can also find some tour leaders to receive detailed information."
"I went there after visiting the Gyeongbokgung palace and for me they look very similar. I can't even distinguish my pictures being taken in both palaces. Maybe the secret garden would have been more interesting, but the ticket for the garden was a little bit too expensive. I was really bored walking around this palace and took about 10 pictures. I think i needed less than 1 hour.
If you have already seen one palace, you can skip this one.
The same thing i had to criticize about the Gyeongbokgung: You can never enter the rooms or make a good picture from the intererior."
Built in 1405 as a secondary palace with a secret garden. I recommend visiting both the palace and the garden. You must have a tour guide for the garden so plan according to tour times. It is quite breathtaking.
"Designated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1997, it is closed to Buckon Hanok Village, we can walk from metro station of Anguk exit No.3 around 7-10min, very easy to found, you can spend 3-4 hours on Changdeokgung and Buckon Hanok Village together. Nearby it also have Gyeongbokgung, No. 1 palace in Korea."
"We spent hours walking around to see where the King lived and where his wife lived, etc.! Beautiful architecture, but no furniture to mention or much else."
"This palace is really underrated for its beauty. During my second visit to Korea, I went to Changdeokgung and realised that it was so much more beautiful than Gyeongbukgong. Also, It was much better to take pictures/hanbok photos as it is less crowded. I missed out on the secret garden because of itinerary constraints but I would urge people to visit the garden during their visit because it is magnificent."
"This enormous palace is good to see in a sunny day. Be ready to walk a lot and if u want to see it all, be there a few hours. There is free tour guides provided and the entrance is only $3 p/p. Bring camera, sunscreen and comfy shoes."
500 years old palace mainly made from wood. Amazing Korean design with beautiful colours. It is recommended to visi Changdeokgung palace
The place is one of the few historical monuments in the city. It' s pictoresque and if you get beautiful weather it' s a pleasure to walk in. Do not miss secret garden which is the most beautiful and interesting part to visit. Guides in typical korean ancoent costume.
"It was interesting to visit the palace at night, but the number of lit up places was very limited. I wish I had gone there during the day instead."
A couple of hours tops is what you should spend here. They have a lovely garden and the changing of the guard is good to see.
Overall i find the Palace in Korea a bit too boring.Is all a shell other than that nothing much to see and everything thing looks the same. Is a shame when you look into the room is either empty or pretty dull. You want to see the richness of it during those days.I reacon they cold do much better. Only highlight i got was the delicious cold Citroen Tea you can buy at the giftshop.That was a really nice drink freshly made lemon tea with pieces of preserved lemons. Loved it.
"I went there with my old parents just yesterday. Another thing to add in your must-see list. Personally, I find Gyeongbokgung more beautiful but the Secret Garden tour in this palace is something you should not miss."
"we went at around 930 am and were hustled into the inner yard. there was the ceremonial precession right behind us. The whole thing takes about an hour and they ask you to stay so you don't interrupt, but you can leave. we stayed for about 30 minutes and it was a neat opportunity to see a historic offering take place."
This is a beautiful place. If you watch historical Korean dramas you have to go here. This is one of the palaces in the stories.
"Nice structures, but a recreation that is only about 15 years old. So the King never sleep here, not have the buildings ever been truly occupied."
"Best advice: Tour around with a tour guide. Tour guide is free you just have to wait for their schedules. They offer Chinese, English, Japanese and Korean languages. You can check also their website which is very helpful! Tour guides are very passionate they will make you love Korea!! <3"
"We came here because the other bigger palace was closed on Tuesday. It was okay, nothing too special in my opinion. But the architect was interesting. It's 3000 won entrance fee and you have to pay extra for the secret garden, which I think is what everyone wants to see. It's another 2000 won and you can only go as part of a guided tour. There is not much shade so it's pretty hot on a summer's day.

Bukchon Village and Insadong Street are close by."
"Amazing!
Don't forget to buy the ticket to secret garden too. Along with the official english language tour guide, immerse yourself with true history of the past Joseon."
"with my family, even though it was so hot day during Aug, but from time to time, can feel windy and it was not that huge like Gyeongbokgung, and building and history was fascinating enough to attract our attention!
Something not good is only there was not enough parking space around this palace"
The most beautiful sceneries I've seen in Seoul. A huge garden (do the Secret Garden tour - about 6 euros) with architecture of the palace objects fitting the surroundings in a beautiful fashion. Everything sits together perfectly in a picturesque way. This was in summer - it gets even prettier in autumn or winter (we've seen pictures). ;) And the tour guide was a Korean lady with the best English I've heard in this whole week I spent in Seoul (this helps a lot if you wanna hear the explanations).
"Changdeokgung Palace was an amazing place to visit. It is easily accessed by the subway station. Inside the palace there are several buildings/monuments and even an art gallery open for viewing.

If you're there for a specific time you can watch as the palace guards rotate. They also offer the option of wearing traditional Korean garments for free (and within a time limit)."
"First thing when you get there....prepare your energy....very big palace with the beautiful secret garden....
This place is easy to found...near angguk station n insadong street....
Quite place for relax.....😉"
"A great day out for wandering through Korean history. We bought the multi-venue ticket which allowed us to visit this palace, including the secret garden, the Jongmyo Shrine, Changgyeonggung Palace, Gyeongokgung Palace and Deoksugung Palace. It cost 10,000 Won. It's worth it if you are going to visit all the places as it costs about 3000 to visit each palace and 1000 to visit the shrine on individual tickets. The grounds are fairly large and we spent the whole morning there. We also visited the secret garden which is lovely but as its only at certain times there were a lot of people and I would have liked to have spent more time there. If you have the ticket book, you can access the Changgyeonggung Palace from this one and save yourself the long walk around to the entrance on the other side. This access is near where the secret garden tour starts. If you haven't got a ticket, there is a ticket booth there so you can still get in."
"Changdeokgung has a secret garden which makes it worth the visit.

We booked tickets online the day before, which might be neccessary as it might sell out during high season. I would advise to try and go early or later i the afternoon as it was a bit too hot to go mid-day in mid-August.

The palace itself and the surrounding buildings are similar to the other palaces in Seoul, however a walk around the secret garden was very nice and made it stand out from the others. If I remember correctly we were told that the lotus flowers bloom in early September so I guess this would be the best time to go, in order to enjoy the full beauty of the Secret Garden."
"This is one of the most favored palace by the kings from all other palaces. More colorful, amazing structures, the Secret Garden, makes the place really special. The secret garden tour is a must here. The overall place is big and lots of history to catch.

Very near from Gyeongbokgung Palace & Bukchon village,"
"This palace is more laid back and cozy, make sure
1- you visit the secret garden (it has a separate ticket)
2- you go with the free tour provided, check the timing before you go"
We enjoyed the Secret Garden tour. Inexpensive tour with a guide. This was the only highlight we liked.
The palace looks stunning especially with the beautiful lake and gardens inside of it. Makes for a nice and cool walk. A must-see !
"We visit the palace for the secret garden, it's a must visit if you are here. Join the garden tour, the story and explanation is interesting and meaningful to learn about Korea's culture and history.

The garden area is big, everywhere is pretty scenic and serene, surrounded by greens. The atmosphere is just lovely, I bet it would be beautiful during autumn with the fall colors. The tour goes through some slopes and hills, so be sure to wear comfortable shoes for walking. Tour guide was really friendly and is willing to answer all our questions.

After the secret garden tour, we visited some other buildings in the palace, there are very similar with other palace, so nothing new for us."
"Please book secret garden tour there,main attraction in the palace. Very quaint place in the middle of the city"
Not bad for making some photo or for walking. Secret garden was closed with no written advertising on ticket-ofice
"Gate guard changing is a must see -- once. Then come back for the better air, temperature, quieter atmosphere and smaller crowds than on the streets outside. Avoid in evenings and on weekends."
"Do not miss the secret garden tour! It's a must! Very close to the metro station, the English secret garden tour was excellent!"
"Came here on a hot day to try and get in some cultural experiences. Was an interesting place to walk around and appreciate the historic architecture, but we didn't realize that you have to book inside tours in advance.

Worth the quick look, but wouldn't make a big deal of fitting it in if your schedule is full."
"A great place to visit in Central Seoul (right by City Hall). The changing of the gate guard is worth seeing, so check what time it will occur."
The price was a bit too high for a family of four but we did look around and visited the museum next door which was free.
"A friend and I took the Secret Garden Tour (1.5 hour tour) and it provided a satisfactory perspective of Korea's history - from its early beginnings to today.

Our guide spoke very easy-to-understand English and used an amplifier so that everyone could hear her. I was amazed to see her wearing a traditional hanbok in the heat and humidity!

The gardens are very beautiful, feature several water fixtures, and wind through a seemingly endless supply of architecturally beautiful pavilions. It does not feel like you are in the middle of a busy city with all the green trees providing shade overhead.

With that said, the tour can still be a little tiring. There are numerous hills and you will walk a fair distance. I would recommend bringing water and insect repellent. There is a cafe at the entrance to the palace and a souvenir shop near the large pond in the Secret Garden Tour. You will find different souvenirs at each so if you see something you like, buy it, as it may not be at the other shops. I purchased a collection of Korean stamps!

There were some neat looking trees on the property - one that is believed to be at least 700 years old! There were lots of photo opportunities and the tour guide was good a maintaining a good pace - not too rushed!

Recommend if you want to see a palace."
If you into the history you will like it. But if you not don't bother to come. It is building only .
"This was my favorite palace, and was recommended by a local as theirs as well. It truly blends Korean architecture with nature. The grounds are surrounded with trees and is much prettier than the Gyeongbokgung Palace. Only frustrating part was that you had to pay an additional fee to view the secret garden. It was really nice that they had a snack bar with free wifi and AC, as it was really hot!!!!"
"There are several palaces of this type in Seoul. If you are expecting a palace in the European sense you will be disappointed. Korean palaces are interesting and quite unique, but, for me, a little goes quite a long way. I would recommend visiting one (or two maximum) palace (give yourself about an hour) and then move on to something else."
Went there with my wife and son especially to see secret garden. Gosh!!! What a waste of time. Nothing to see in that garden. Mughal gardens in india are much better. Took free English tour. Felt walking in a normal garden. But totally disappointed. Guide used to show a simple hut with no great architecture and give its history. I got to know that I am doomed when they told that the 1st place we will visit iin the garden is the most beautiful place. A big no from my side.
"the palace follows the usual style of these types of buildings, There's not really much to see but the interiors of the buildings have a lot of interesting detail and if you can get a tour guide it makes the visit and understanding the context more enjoyable"
"I'd recommend this as your first stop in Seoul to get a feel for what Korea has to offer. It will most likely also be all the palaces and temples you will want to see for your whole time in Seoul, which is fair because there's so much more to do in the city.
Maybe my expectations were too high, but while I found it was nice to walk around and experience something I don't normally see which is of high historic value, I found it a little underwhelming. Although for such a low price it's definitely worth it.

You're free to walk around by yourself without a tour, plenty of opportunities to take photos, the tour isn't really essential unless you want to learn a lot about the history. The Secret Garden tour is reasonably good and gives you enough information about the palace to keep you satisfied. Even then, you're not really missing out if you don't take a tour, but it's still nice to do.
Jongmyo is the only place in the area where you've forced to take a tour 6 days of the week, so if you have limited time I'd recommend not taking any tours here."
"This is a smaller than Gyeongbokgung but more easily and prettier. The garden gives it a touch of relaxation and contact with nature. If I had to choose from the two, I would definitely go to this one."
Beautilful place to visit and take a lot of nice pictures. Try to book the secret garden tour. Dont forget to wear a comfortable pair of shoes.
"Another lovely palace. I was too tired to join the Secret garden tour. I had walked all the sights that day and the tour is 90mins, but supposed to be great. Enjoyed looking around palace. Cheap entry and quiet (3.30pm Saturday)"
"The two times i went to South Korea, I went to this palace. The reason for the second time was because I was not able to catch the Secret Garden tour and I was with a different set of friends the second time i went

I'm not sure how this palace is compared to the other palaces but i't definitely good for picture taking and it's near the bukchon hanok village :D The first time you arrive here you'll be thrilled by the giant ark at the front. I am not sure how long we spent just to get a perfect picture there. When you go inside, the doors and the koreanovela feels will hit you!(if you are a fan :D).

After a while it will feel kind of boring as the palace is very big haha and i'm sure you'll feel tired! But despite this i would definitely recommend this place and the huwon tour i would recommend on autumn or spring because the trees are dry when we got there.

After this you can go straight to bukchon hanok for more of the koreanovela feel. :D"
The tour of the Secret Garden was absolutely beautiful. I really recommend to book ahead for this tour. The guide was really nice and professional as it was 27 degrees C and she was wearing hanbok on top of her normal clothes and still managed to smile and made few jokes. She recommend people to see this palace in autumn where leaves turn to orange which will make it even more beautiful.
"The great place to visit. Great memory, so the UN heritage site.
Should spend 2-3 hours to relax and absorb the atmosphere."
"No, we didn't wear Hanbok to go in but we saw a group of people wearing Hanbok. Latter when I read from Internet said that if you wear Hanbok to visit castle, you will get free entrance. What a waste for us! Imagine wearing Hanbok with the castle as your background! This castle is huge, we took our leisure to walk from one room to another. Each room has explanation on the function in multiple languages. Feels like being transported back to centuries ago in Seoul 😂"
"Gorgeous palace with a far wider variety of buildings than Gyeongbokgung, make sure you attend the secret garden tour for some of the most stunning views and architecture you'll see in Seoul. Also, it is quiet and positively serene compared to the crowds of GBG which was full of Chinese tour groups."
"Unfortunately I didn't make it to the Secret Garden. However the 1hr guided tour thru the palace was also very interesting. The English from the guide is very good and understandable, tho a bit rushed due to the 1hr limitation. It could have been longer and detailed in my opinion. Well preserved site.
I went on a weekday in the morning. So there is kinda less buzzle, I get to take pictures without too many people in front of it."
so cultural and explorative i really love wearing hanbok! hahahah it feels like im one of the queens
"This royal palace was much nicer than kyungbok palace.
Kyungbok palace was a nice palace but I was much more impressed by this palace.
If you have time, You need to visit secret garden of this palace.
It's worthy!"
"Interesting it has a ""secret garden tour"" but a further entry charge. Around the many buildings are people dressed in traditional clothes. The palace is on the hop on hop off bus tour route."
If you cannot go inside the palace then why you go? Just to walk around!. It supposed to be a king palace but there was no furniture or maybe there was inside and I didn't pay attention for it.
"First you need to make sure you have booked secret garden online, just need to show at ticket centre a copy of confirmation pay the ticket. Nice Palace to visit, but i would think mayb winter and autumn would b the best to visit, summer is hummer and steaming, it would b a long walk during the tour, so ols have a comfy shoes."
"In Seoul it's hard to get an idea of traditional Korean culture since everywhere you look, you find office and residential towers. This palace, in the heart of the city, is a beautiful oasis of Korean tradition. The 'secret garden' is especially worth a visit."
"The palace is an expansive retreat from the hustle and bustle of surrounding Seoul. In a few steps, you are transported back in time, especially if you or the people you are with are dressed in Hanbuk wear.

Bring water and an umbrella on a hot day. Make sure you do the secret garden tour and at the end of the tour, don't take the stairs-- take the long way back-- good way to get photo ops along the way without the crowds!

BTW, you get in free if dressed in Hanbuk!"
"For me, this is my favorite palace in Seoul. Not as grand as Kyong Bok, but charming in it's own way. Stunning architecture and landscaping. The secret gardens are well worth the extra ticket. Visitors are allowed in small groups of about 50 people at a time. In the Secret Garden (Beewon) you can see magnificent ponds, smaller intimate scale buildings made for the royal family and unusual sets of buildings intended for the royals to ""experience"" a rustic village. The area for poetry writing and drinking is well preserved."
"Visitors were not allowed to enter the main building to view the internal structure.

I was impressed in the very beginning, but it became boring after walking around as the exterior design of all structures looked the same.

The place was well maintained and cleaned but you need to pay for entry fees."
"The palace is very nice but keep in mind it's been rebuilt after being destructed by the Japanese. The palace itself is cozy and not exhausting, interesting to see the layout, but the secret garden is the major attraction here, so please make sure you visit it! It's spread on a relatively wide surface but the alleys are very pleasant and it conveys peace and calm, it's a definite must. You hand to join a tour in order to be able to enter, at specific hours, and it takes about 1.5h but it's totally worth it and the guide was very gifted to transport us in the mood and the stories of the time."
"While we learned a bit about the Joseon Dynasty and the end of it, this is a tour of old - they are empty and closed off. Since we didn't book a tour of the secret garden, we just walked the grounds. Not a lot of relief from the heat."
This is a great palace in an interesting area after your visit. Beautiful gardens and a great tour for English speakers. A must visit in Seoul.
The palace is reachable by subway. Near Mt Namsan. Love the guard changing ceremony. Great place to enjoy the architecture and nature. Great place for a wedding photoshoot is they allow it. Not sure
Very appealing and loaded with history. Stay for the changing of the guard. Beautiful ceremony! Easy access bu bus and by train. Wear comfortable shoes and clothing. Read ahead and enjoy the history as you walk thru.
I loved visiting this palatial complex. The gardens were beautiful and added so much to the complex. The buildings are beautiful.
An occupied palace fir over 600 years with amazing grounds. The maintenance must be huge but this place is kept in good condition despite the small admission fee. The English secret garden tour at 130pm was great. It's up and over a couple of hills but you see some tranquil and beautiful sights on this tour. Allow a good couple of hours to do it justice.
"If you are in Seoul this is a must go to spot.
Stunningly beautiful and peaceful with jaw dropping sights around every corner."
"If you will visit only one palace, I recommend this one. This palace is smaller than the main palace but still quite large. The palace has a ""Secret garden"" but note that you will have to purchase a separate ticket for that because you may only visit in a group.
Perfect for a hot day because in the garden the trees will make a cooling shadow over the paths. The place is very quiet even though it is almost in the heart of Seoul.
They sell water in the garden tour with a reasonable price."
It is recommended for you to visit Changdeokgung Palace after you have visited the Gyeongbuk Palace. Don't forget to join the trip to the Secret Garden in the palace as well.
If you r in love with the historical place. This is the right choice for you. This palce was recognized as a world cultural heritage site by UNESCO too.
"I went in July which was very warm and humid so if you are going at this time make sure you have plenty of water and sun protection. The visit would have been nicer if the weather was cooler. The entrance fee is 3000 but I would advise you to get the Secret Garden tour which includes the entrance fee at 8000. For a 1.5 hour tour they bring you further inside and you get to see more. The palace is peaceful and beautiful but I was a little underwhelmed. Asked a friend who went to Gyeongbokgung palace, she says it is grander than this palace so wished I gone to that one instead."
We visited Changdeokgung Palace after a visit to Gyeongbokgung Palace in the morning. They are very different and unique in their own way. I personally prefer the Changedeokgung more due to the Secret Garden. You can only visit the secret garden by joining the guided tour. I would recommend that you book the ticket via its website in advance to avoid disappointment. It's an hour and a half tour and it's a pity that one is not allowed to stay and explore more after the tour.
"Definitely this is the most beautiful palace in Seoul. I would totally recommend to buy the ticket for both the general entrance and the secret garden.

Tip: you can only access the secret garden by tour, so I recommend to book by website or come early."
It was raining the day we visited but still a good time and worth having a look and learning the history.
"we signed up 2 months early for this limited evening full moon 2 hour tour only offered 2 days per month in the summer for foreigners.
strolling thru the palace at dusk and then through the gardens at night and watching performers play traditional Korean music, dress in traditional costumes and sing folk songs was extremely worthwhile..
while getting tickets was a somewhat complicated process involving registering on a website and then returning to purchase the tickets, whatever hoops you need to jump through are worth it. bring insect repellent though."
"I love this place as this is the heart of the korea empire culture from ages. There are lots to see and sometime if you are lucky enough, you will see some special performance. The palace include a lot of painting and there is also a library inside the palace. The presentient working office is just right behind the Palace. Many people there when this is a nice weather. Be sure to check out TravoAsia.com first, they also have apps. as they are specialize in Korea attraction ticket and may provide you with surprise discount. I have bought some attraction ticket from them and it was good. For transportation, you can reach the palace by subway, although you have take about 10 min walk from there. have a good day."
"My fiancée and I visited this palace on a Sunday afternoon.

The sheer size of the palace is quite impressive and it is well worth the 3 000 won entrance fee. We also wanted to experience the secret garden, however access to the garden is restricted to guided tours only, and the tour time table did not fit with our time schedule.

Opening hours (palace & secret garden) is from 09:00. Closing time varies between 16:30 to 18:00 depending on the time of year. Closed on Mondays.

Guided tours (in English) to the secret garden is at:
11:30
13:30
14:30
15:30
English speaking guided tours are offered only between February and October.

Guided tours in English to the palace area are at 10:30 and 14:30 only.

Fees for the palace area is 3000 / 1500 won for adults / children, while fees for the secret garden (palace area included) are 8000 / 4000 won for adults / children. Seniors (over 65 years of age) pay 5000 won.

My fiancée and I found our visit to be a rewarding experience and we would not hesitate recommending it as an attraction."
"The secret gardens make this tour worth it. Even though it is ranked higher, we thought this palace was better than Gyeongbukgung Palace.

The tour was 1.5 hours and I thought I would get bored--not a chance. Every 5 mins we were on to a different area with a new story. It was amazing."
"Among palaces in Seoul, Changdeokgun isn't the biggest. It is smaller compared to other palaces but has a beautiful garden and a museum. This museum is exclusive for reservation first."
"It is one of the 'Five Grand Palaces' built by the kings of the Joseon Dynasty (1392––1897). It was heavily damaged during the Japanese Occupation of Korea (1910––1945). It was the site of the royal court and the seat of government until 1868. Korea's last Emperor Sunjong, lived here until his death in 1926. Currently, only about 30% of the pre-Japanese structures survive and consist of 13 buildings remaining on the palace grounds and 28 pavilions in the gardens, occupying 110 acres. This palace is extremely beautiful and well kept. It is a pleasure to see how Koreans have gone to great length to preserve their history."
I have been to this palace on first day of my visit to seoul. The history of seoul is interesting and the palace is replicating it. Classic buildings are hallmarks of Korean culture. Yo can enjoy it if you have interest in history and culture
Beautiful palace with rich historical background. Good to wear comfortable walking shoes. Recommended to join guided tour to understand the history. Will do this trip again.
"If you are going to Changdeokgung, secret garden is a must-see. I heard there are limited people allowed to go in the secret garden at one time, so what we did is reserve the slot online. There are several slots of guided tour in Korean, Japanese, English and Chinese. Expect hilly roads so make sure to wear comfortable shoes. But all the breathtaking views make every steps worthwhile to be able to witness with your own eyes and capture inside the memories and photos."
Took the guided tour of the Secret Garden in the palace. Guide was very entertaining and knowledgeable of the history of the place. Approximately 2 hours tour but the area covered is vast and the secret garden really is beautiful.
It's quite a bit larger than the palace we visited earlier but there aren't as many people here. The peace and quiet is wonderful and we are looking forward to touring the Secret Garden.
"A must-see. Personally, I prefer the Gyeongbokgung Palace but maybe you need to see both to appreciate the subtle differences. A stroll through the complex takes around 30min on your own, the guided tours last 1hr but as we had kids, we lasted only about 10minutes before backing out. I'd recommend to book for the Secret Garden tour online to guarantee your spot as it can get very busy and you might not get in on your preferred times.
The secret garden tour lasts 1.5hrs and is perfectly doable even with small kids. If you have a stroller or a scooter, bring it with you. There is no refreshments throughout the whole complex, so stock up on something to nibble on. A water bottle is a must too. Allow roughly 2-3hrs to visit."
"After visiting Geongbokgung, we think that this palace is a waste of time! Its true that both have their attractions but there are so much more to see in Gyeongbok! We did not go to the Secret Garden, though."
"There is a secret garden in the palace. In order to get in the garden. You need to buy a ticket which cost 5,000 KWN. You'll go through the garden with a guide."
"You buy a ticket and join a group tour in your language - English, Korean, Chinese or Japanese. Exquisitely landscaped garden, quite a bit of up and down walking but plenty of opportunities to sit and reflect. So peaceful in the bustling heart of the city. Definitely one of my favourite places in Seoul and I would definitely go again."
"we joined a free english tour of the palace, run several times a day, which was very interesting, and added to our experience on the day."
The palace guides have some personality...actually was fun to learn a little history about S. Korea..
"This is my favorite palace in Seoul. I have lived here for a couple of years and have seen all of the palaces multiple time with all the guests who come visit. I have been here twice and it is beautiful.
I recommend doing both tours if you have time. I was reluctant to do the palace tour (on my 9th palace visit) but really enjoyed it. The guide focuses on telling you what happened in each building and how they were used as well as fun little stories about the people who lived there. It was a tour unique to this place and moved at a good speed.
The garden tour really depends on the guide. My first time he was fantastic and gave funny stories about each place and the second he let us wander alone a bit more. No matter what you must do the tour to see the garden, which is really the whole point of this place. Strongly recommend - if you only see 1 palace other than Gyeongbukgung this should be it."
"When you go here, you should definitely get a ticket to see the Biwon Secret Garden. When I joined the English tour at 10:30 am, the English tour for the Secret Garden followed right afterwards at 11:30 am which made things convenient. Both guides did a good job explaining the palace and the garden."
This one of the must do in terms of Korean tourist sites. It had vast and big grounds and a lot of palace buildings yet had an eerie tranquil feeling about it. The buildings seemed to be constantly destroyed and rebuilt - which is a bit like the psychic of the Korean history - forever under attack. It is an interesting way to learn the history of Korea and how hard it must have been. The grounds were really big so it was an impressive show - well spent the afternoon meandering around. A lot of the Koreans were also walking around taking photos in their traditional outfits as one gets free entrance wearing the traditional Hancock.
"Changdeokgung is located near Gyeongbokgung palace. Distance is about 800 meter. Although it's not as big as Gyeongbokgung, but Changdeokgung is the prettiest palace here. And it is more quiet. You can stroll around slowly and enjoy its pretty buildings."
"a very good friend recommended to visit join a tour in the secret garden . but english tours were fully booked and korean tours were still available. we took the korean tour.
didnt appreciate much what the tour guide was saying but i admired what i see. very nice view. nice to have photos taken as well. but going uphill or taking the stairs is very tiring. recommended only to those very athletic one"
"Absolutely amazing to see how South Korea has preserved their history, while developing modern facilities equal to any in the world. The palace has been beautifully maintained and provide excellent guides with invaluable information to visitors."
Enjoyed the free tour of the palace and then the secret garden. The tour guides were excellent. The secret garden wall was very worthwhile despite the hot summer heat. A good few hours - could have spent longer.
"If you've been to Gyeongbokgun palace, Changdeokgung is probably something you can skip if you're in a hurry. Changdeokgung is smaller and has more traditional housing. It is very similiar in terms of structure, the look etc... i liked the long walk towards the main palace (on the left) as many korean drama has that.
If you're into korean history, then I would recommend to visit. If not, it probably won't be that interesting/exciting."
Because of time limit I could only visit this Palace. I couldn't afford more free time. I could enjoy at least a short aspect of this culture. The secrte garden will remain secret only guided visit is allowed. Again not enough time!
The palace is steeped with heritage and history and is declared so by UNESCO. The rooms are decorated very well and each room has its purpose of having. The Kings throne and the feast he would have is very interesting to watch. A must visit for all. I went twice to visit
Great UNESCO landmark remarkably preserved in he heart of Seoul. Great glimpse into the imperial court life. I would skip the secret garden tour.
My daughter and I visited Changdeokgung Palace during our trip to Seoul. What a beautiful example of Korean History and Architecture. If it wasn't for all the tourists it would be a great place to sit and meditate. Really enjoyed the detail on the roofs and eaves. Take your time and enjoy.
Ample space for anyone to snap photo and walkthrough for a historical attraction. FOC and do not have to worry about crowds as the place is really huge!
"This is where the kings and queens of Korea lived, and around 30% is in original condition. Book a guide and get the story of the travails of the royal family over the centuries."
"Sadly most of South Korea has been devastated by wars or fires, so most of the buildings of historical significance have undergone many renovations and rebuilds to present a picture of ""old life"". The Changdeokgung Palace is a lovely place, which was originally built in 1405. Full restoration work began in 1991 and continue today. Many local young people visit wearing full traditional dress, which gives visitors a chance to take lovely photos."
"The real star of this place is the Hiwon, secret garden area. It's about a 55 minute tour and be sure to bring good walking shoes. The secret garden tour fills up fast and they offer it to English speakers only a few times a day so come early to get a ticket (an extra cost to the general admission ticket) If you purchase the combination ticket book you just have to show your secret garden part of the book to get a ticket."
"Not as grand as the Gyeongbokgung Palace but a more peaceful and calmer place. Unlike Gyeongbokgung, Changdeokgung wasn't completely destroyed by the Japanese and reconstructed, so it has a special serenity almost palpable.

The real draw for me is the Secret Garden tour. This is the rest of the palace complex, about 60% of the total area. You have to book online in advance, and the slots for a tour in English go fast. We were fortunately to get 2 of the last 3 slots for a late morning tour. The Secret Garden tour is quite a long walk across hilly terrain, but what a beautiful place! A royal refuge indeed. Pity the royal tombs were closed to conservation.

My advice is to plan ahead and make your booking way in advance, and bring a good pair of hiking shoes."
"This was a great alternative to the more famous Gyeongbokgung Palace, which was closed on the only day I was in Seoul. The structures around the palace complex are magnificent and well-preserved and the guide for my tour gave a lot of good info about the palace and its place in Korean history and culture."
"The only reason I give it 4 stars, is that like many places in Korea they don't give information or notice about how much walking is required or the terrain. I took my parents here and they loved the rich history, the large spaces, but the walking, especially on a hot day in Seoul can be a lot. Make sure to go into the Palace and see the bench where the King would sit. It still smells musty and the old yellow curtains hang low. The best spot is the Secret Garden, but note this is a long walk with many steep hills and climbing."
"Had reached the palace in the late afternoon. It is quite accessible, walking distance from Angguk subway station. About 5 to 10 mins walk.

As it was spring time, the flowers are in full bloom, it was quite a sight to behold. Quite a different experience from that in Gyeonbokgong.

Had wanted to visit the secret garden, but was closed by late afternoon. Nevertheless, it was a relaxing place to spend a few hours in."
The philosophy of Confusius comes alive when you visit this beautiful Palace complex. We took a taxi from our hotel and took the English language tour (taxis are a bargain in Seoul). A Japanese colleague with us noticed that the Japanese language guide made no mention of the Japanese having once burnt this Palace.
"Very historically interesting, as well as beautiful! Lovely gardens, designed to complement the natural landscape. Good restaurants nearby."
Nice place to check out probably can do this in an hour and just check out the main palace without walking around everywhere as it gets a bit boring after an hr. I missed the changing of the guard if you can when the change guards will be a better experience
"For a royal palace this does seem a little stark, the buildings whilst undoubtedly historic are not noteworthy in themselves the roofing is impressive. Nice gardens at the top to wander around and it is a very peaceful spot. Worth a trip certainly but will not have you swooning in awe. Definitely take the special garden tour, the highlight."
We had the English guide take us around the compound. There was one point we had to climb steep slopes. We paid extra for a ticket into the secret garden. More like a peek into history for a day. Won't come again.
"The palace itself was well kept, and manageable in size to visit. Nothing spectacular if you have already coming from China and went to the Forbidden City, for example, but if this is one of your first palaces, I think is worthy."
"The main palace is beautiful but you definitely have to visit the Secret gardens. We visited in summer, but I guess the garden will be beautiful in Autumn and Spring. There are only two English tours to the secret Garden in a day and that's a problem. You cannot visit the Secret Garden just by yourself."
"Although the Palace itself is grand and worth visiting, what stood out was the Secret Garden. On a cloudy, breezy afternoon, meandering through the garden was delightful. But as there are only guided tours of the Secret Garden and a limited number of visitors are allowed each day, its best to book in advance. Can be easily done on the Changdeokgung Palace website. There are guided tours in different languages including English and Japanese."
"The strange history concerning how many times it has been destroyed and rebuilt (portions at least) is fascinating. And from far it looks small but as you approach you see the intricate details and great attention that was laid to each element that makes it so beautiful.
There were lots of people, but I found that charming. It was good to have a tour guide to tell us about the nuances of the structures and the layout and some of the stories that make a place so much richer.
Not good to go on a rainy day.
Worth a visit if you have the time - about 1:30-2 hours is good enough. Then it becomes a bit repetitive.
If you get a chance walk around the area in the city because there is lots to do there as well, not just sightseeing."
"It was a cloudy day when we visited this palace of the last king of Korea. Luckily we managed to join an english tour @2.30pm to find out more about the history of this palace.
We didn't join the secret garden tour @3.30pm as it was kinda drizzling and we don't have any umbrella with us today.

The secret garden was where the king spent most of his time together with his most beloved concubine ( whom he couldn't make as his first wife as he wasn't allowed to choose his own wife)
He built a house for her next to the garden ( something unheard apparently , showed how much he loved her)"
"The palace is considerably smaller than Gyeongbok Palace but this was expected since based on the review I read, it is not the main royal palace.

One of the reasons my friend and I went to Changdeok Palace was its Secret Garden, as it is one of UNESCO's World Heritage Sites. The way it was advertised was that it is a very splendid and romantic place but the reality was far from it and in my opinion, it is not representative to be a royal garden. Even worse was that we had to pay separate entrance fees for the palace and the garden and that of the garden is more expensive."
"The tour of the palace is truly great, but the real gem is the Secret Garden tour. Don' t miss it! You may want to check before-hand, so you're not disappointed, but the Secret Garden tour runs only occasionally. You are truly in an oasis in the middle of the beautiful city of Seoul."
Allow plenty of time to visit this palace is you are going to do the Secret Garden guided tour (recommended). Bring water and good walking shoes!
"My guide book said this one is the smaller and less impressive of the two imperial palaces. I disagree. The ground seemed bigger, more buildings and a ""secret garden"". The garden requires a separate ticket but worth the money.
As with the ""bigger"" palace, there are many building that you cannot walk into, just look into. There grounds are more landscaped, even outside of the ""secret garden"" . If you only have time to go to one palace, go to this one."
"Very similar to the Forbidden City in Beijing...

This place is smaller than Forbidden City but the architecture are as elaborate as compared...

Good to experience once..."
Our annual Rotary International convention was held in Seoul Korea this year. We took a few extra days for sightseeing. This Palace was one of the highlights for me. I love history and I love beautiful things. This inexpensive tour combines both of those. I love the way it Korean culture honors its history. This is a beautiful place to visit without spending too many dollars. You can do the whole thing in an hour or two. I also very much enjoyed the museum adjacent to the Palace. Air-conditioned and a nice restaurant inside it was a good diversion in the middle of a hot day. If you can do this with the tour guide it is even better. Too many things that you simply would not understand without having a guide.
"A small palace where you can spend one or two hours.

They also have changing guard with two shows a day, check their new schedule first, otherwise you will miss it..

At the entrance, look for some young ladies who are wearing a yellow t-shirts. They are students from the local school and they volunteer to be tour guide. This service is free and they are a bunch of friendly and helpful people. Perhaps this is part of their history, so most of them are very knowledgeable with all part of the palace and can walk through each part with you. They are very proficient with English and some times can be humor too.

After the tour, it is optional to complete a survey for them and they will bring back to their school.

This palace is comparatively small with the Grand Palace, but each section has its own functionality. The secret garden is very beautiful.

We are lucky to enter for free because that week was their Golden Week, otherwise, you have to pay Won3000 per person, but the cost is worth for it."
"We did the Moonlight tour which only happens less than 10 times a year and I must say that the tour was an incredible experience, walking inside the palace at night with the light in the garden ... The secret garden during the night will be my best memory from Seoul."
Very beautiful and well kept the Koreans have gone to great detail to preserve what the great kings left. I found every detail worth the visit.
"You don't need to budget a whole half day here, but certainly make it an early morning or late afternoon stop. A visit is worth cost of admission, and if you like history, try to link up for a guided tour (or at least the audio tour)--it's well organized."
"The general palace area is nice and sprawling, and on the weekday that i went, I could find places that were relatively quiet. When I arrived, I pondered a bit over whether to spring extra for the garden tour and I'm glad I did. I can see why they need it to be guided as it's a wide open space with a few built up areas connected by paths. Letting people roam freely around historical buildings with little supervision would be way trouble. it can get crowded with the tour throng but the uniqueness of the pavilions makes it worthwhile."
"It was a rainy day but we already booked a tour in the Secret Garden. The secret garden tour was totally worth it. There a lot of hiking and walking so wear comfortable shoes.

If you are wearing hanbok (can be rent from a shop opposite the palace), you can a free entry to the palace (not the secret garden). It is the best location to do some photoshooting as well.

There are only one place where the toilet is in the palace and another one in the secret garden."
Somehow I thought a palace would be an inside tour. Not this one. It is all outside and on a hot day there is little shade. Since it is central you have to expect traffic snarls to get there.
We booked in advance for the Palace and Secret Garden English guided tours. Both guides were informative and engaging. It was a hot day and we were quite exhausted after 2.5 hours but nonetheless a interesting break from all the shopping in Seoul.
"This palace was modified in the the 1920s by the King to include electricity and our guide showed us ramps that the King had built to accommodate his car and the Queen's car. Though a UNESCO World Heritage Site, the modernization, though not readily apparent, rather ruins the historical perspective. Still, interesting to visit."
Took the tour of the palace and then booked the secret garden tour as well which was really special and some interesting ponds and gardens to see along the way. Well worth the trip.
Great tour...very interesting history. Our tour guide communicated some very interesting facts. Covers alot of ground and the decor was beautiful.
This is a beautiful palace. I would highly recommend arriving early to be able to see the secret garden which gets fully booked really quickly.
"I believe you do not need to visit Changdeokgung Palace and Gyeongbokgung Palace. They are pretty much the same, though the tour we took at Gyeongbokgung Palace was better. The best part of Changdeokgung Palace was The Secret Garden. You can take the tour of The Palace, and then take the tour of The Secret Garden. The Palace tours in English are at 10:30AM & 2:30pm, the Garden is at 11:30, 1:30 & 3:30"
I went their in May 2016 from India. The place had an temp of around 24 degree Celsius. for me it was like waaoww... Nice palace in mountains with a beautiful scenery around. it is a small half and hour drive from Seoul city and an ideal place to spend your evening.
"The best part if this palace that distinguished it from the others is the Secret Garden. When we went there, the Secret Garden is only accessible via group guided tours and we are not allowed to wander off on our own in order to ensure the garden is well preserved. We booked for the guided English tour online before we flew to Seoul. Our lady guide was excellent, her English command is very good and at each place she would tell us the history & story behind the spots that we visited. Normally every year during Spring, they would also have night tours to the garden. Do note that the guided night tour is only open for foreigners an only available on 1 day or max 2 days per month ( I think they chose the nights with full moon).

Among the 5 palaces, I would recommend this palace to visit other than Gyengbokgung."
"Never visited this palace before especially for my husband, daughter and son in law neve had a chance to see what is Korea or Asia. They only knew from the TV and megazines.
It was very educational and opening visitor's eyes to different time and culture. I enjoyed for my family."
"10 minutes away by taxi from our hotel Myeongdong area, we purchased royal palace which we can use for several palace, secret garden was included.. worth a walk"
"Visited on a Saturday morning, a little busy but not overwhelming. Excellent guide, good English. First tour takes an hour around the main palace. Visit the secret garden,it is well worth it. Tour takes an hour and a half. No food allowed but you can buy water half way round. It is a bit hilly but worth the trek. Make sure you leave enough time for your first tour and the secret garden. You reserve as specific time for the secret garden. Also the traffic was bad so if you are travelling by taxi leave enough time. Well worth the visit, a small piece of history in the centre of this modern city"
"It was nice and the free english tour is a must have to learn more about the culture and how they use those houses before.

If you stay at a hanok guesthouse like we did, you can walk to this palace. The secret garden also was nice to visit. Its longer then visiting the palace."
The secret garden is definitely worth exploring. It has nice leafy gardens and nice little pavilions. The tranquility make the visit very intimate. A bit of difference from the Gyeongbukgong.
"Great palace to show how old people are leaving with fantastic place

I went there by a taxi from myeongdong around 6000kw ( $5) and you can walk to there around 1.8 km

The tickets 3000 kw and if you want with secret garden 8000 kw

There time table to visit secret garden for foreign and it take 1.30 hours only rounding in secret garden"
"The palace itself is disappointing, but the secret garden is amazing. The garden is extensive and the tour is available in English. Personally found the tour to be a little crowded. Would have preferred to spend some quite time in the gardens instead."
Wear a hanbok and get free entry to the palace! We enjoyed taking pictures in the palace. A must do is go online to book a guided tour to the secret garden. Although we had to pay for this but it is worth the time and money to enter this part of the palace.
We took the Secret Garden tour with a knowledgeable English-speaking guide. There are a lot of people who do this tour so I would suggest one to be early as they are punctual. A walk through this Joseon dynasty palatial grounds gives insight into the ways of the Korean royals. The secret garden covers a lot of the palatial grounds with many intricate and unique pavilions and ponds. The setting of these structures was done with much harmony with the landscape. A visit to this palace is absolutely worth it.
"Due to various korean soap operas that I've watched, I was really interested in these special castles. It is a huge symbol of the pure korean or far east architecture. Fantastic garden in shape of a jungle with an awesome lake in the heart of it. Totally the environment is unbelievably soothing and relaxing.
The main problem was its accessibility, public transportation is not really around the area and it took 30 minutes for us to get there from a subway station."
"Changdeokgung Palace is huge! When entering the palace, you would get the feel of the Jeoson era. You could imagine the Royalties walking through the corridors of the palace dressed in their royal garbs. Inside Changdeokgung is the Secret Garden, only accessible for when you join a tour. I would suggest to join the tour as it would give you more insight about the history of the garden and why it's given a special place."
"a collection of several palaces with traditional Korean design.
there are a wide area of different buildings from king palaces, queen palaces, offices, kitchen and so on.
they were made of wood and cover by beautiful colors.
its like a dream! you lost in history.
behind the palace you see a green park and lake.
also you find some museum here too."
"The experience is surreal.. walking through the palace with our guide Matt explaining the different Dynasty, Kings and what happened during each eras is like having a history lesson! The beauty of the Palace is it's not ostentatious but does tell the story! Definitely worth a visit!"
"Changdeokgung Palace offers a moonlight tour of the palace grounds for foreigners during the summer months on full moon nights. We booked the tour months in advance and it was worth every penny. The palace is beautiful but the only way to see the private (secret) gardens is to book a tour. We started the tour at the entrance gates where we were met by people dressed in traditional clothing. We were able to take pictures and then the tour began. We carried battery operated lanterns as we explored the grounds. Building and trees were lit so it was easy to navigate. As we walked the palace, performers played traditional instruments and folk songs in the background. It was quite romantic and magical to hear the music and imagine yourself wondering the grounds in dynasty times.

The tour lead to a performance stage where traditional sweets and plum or cinnamon tea was served. We then watched several traditional performances that were beautiful. Our tour guide was very knowledgeable and earpieces were provided so it was very easy to hear while on the tour. This is defiantly worth the money and it is must see in Korea. There is a lot of walking involved on the tour so wear comfortable shoes."
"This is a place that was was overwelmeming , the structure was amazing, not unlike many places of worship in Asia"
There is a lot of walking but it's worth it. No food allowed so eat before you come. Water only. This is my favorite of the 5 Seoul palaces. The garden tour was a beautiful hike. Please make sure your camera is fully charged and you wear bug spray and sunscreen! You might want to take a lot of garden pictures.
"One person's opinion: I have seen better Asian palaces. Changdeokgung — also known as Changdeokgung Palace — is set within a large park in Seoul. It is one of the ""Five Grand Palaces"" built by the kings of the Joseon Dynasty, but I do not think it was grand.

This visit was part of a cruise ship 2 place tour; we booked it because we were afraid to take cabs from the Incheon port to the palace in Seoul - because of traffic. There was a lot of traffic, for sure, but there was no time saving on a bus vs. a private cab. I would take a private cab from Incheon port into the palace, if I could do this journey again.

Missed it: I did not see the Huwon gardens and I did not know it even existed. Behind the palace lies the 78-acre garden which was originally constructed for the use of the royal family and palace women. The garden incorporates a lotus pond, pavilions, and landscaped lawns, trees, and flowers. There are over 26,000 specimens of a hundred different species of trees in the garden and some of the trees behind the palace are over 300 years old. This was not part of the cruise ship tour, but should be part of any new tour."
I was very pleasantly surprised to visit this beautiful palace and to not have to share it with throngs of other people as I would have had to in the main palace a short distance away.
There is a free guide service inside the palace. A signboard shows the timings. The guide provided us with lot of interesting facts about the palace. It was one hour of guidance.
"I prefer Changdeokgung Palace over Gyeongbokgung Palace. This palace is lovely, I enjoyed the Secret Garden Tour (Paid for) with my family. The english speaking tour guide was excellent, speaking in clear English and giving great details of the history of the palace. Overall, an enjoyable trip here."
"I don't know why I wasn't really impressed by palaces overall, it's an average place to see and take pictures."
"Another nice place to be getting out of the hustle and bustle of the city but you have to elbow your way past the throngs of tourists, especially the tour groups getting guided tours."
"It good to view and learn from others, especially, the history and culture. Worth to take a walk and enjoy the scenery."
The garden in the palace is natural and beautiful. Felt so relax and could easily spend half a day strolling around myself. We did the walking tour which was great to get some insights on the history.
"I visited the palace as part of my conference tour group. The Ministry of Tourism had made a special arrangement for my group to see the palace at night. It was a wonderful moonlight tour and even some of the Koreans in my group were so pleased because they had never visited this place at night. We were even treated to special cultural shows, which gave me a good appreciation for the rich and diverse Korean culture."
This was the only palace I visited in Seoul and I was glad I visited this palace. It was worth it. The palace is not as big as the palaces in Beijing but it is still as beautiful. We met Korean actor Lee Dong Wok who was shooting a korean drama on our way here. He was very friendly and handsome 😉. Overall..make sure you visit this palace and then take a short break at one if the cafes nearby.
"My friend and I thought that this palace was closed, but because of their celebration of experiencing to meet the palaces (Sorry I forgot the terms), we were able to see a different attraction since South Korea has a lot of palaces. We visited the Secret Garden. If you bought a Combination Ticket (worth 10,000 KRW), there's a different attachment for voucher in going to the Secret Garden. If you want to have the tour of the Secret Garden and you bought the combination ticket, go to the ticketing office first to convert the voucher to a ticket in going to the said tour. We had the 3:30 English tour and it ended at around 5 though what my friend and I was we went ahead of those who had the English tour and savoured the moment of taking pictures of sceneries and ourselves. But I'd say it's nice to also listen to the pieces of information that I heard from the tour guide about the Secret Garden since the curiosity of knowing why it is the Secret Garden is explained in the tour."
"I didn’t think about the trail to get the secret garden so I just used sandal and it was hard,,but doable for me because I’m pretty good hiker. I figured out this palace style tend to be Korean style which is built base on nature environment."
"A must visit in Korea..You cannot tell that you'd visited Korea if you hadn't paid a visit to this place
--- July 2013 and March 2014"
It's the place to visit in Korea. We have many nice walk around to explain the history of Korea. Discovery of new methodology...
This place compares internationally and has a majestic character uniquely its own. I have seen some of the most prominent European palaces and this one is up there with the best. It would be fair to say that every single wooden element is a piece of art in its own right. As far as I was able to tell the entire building is made of wood with no (visible) metallic elements. The wood is meticulously hand painted with stunningly articulate floral patterns. The walls and ceilings are decorated with traditional symbolic paintings. This is a must see and highly recommended.
"The official Seoul tourist map suggests that this palace is above and the other one is close to the metro station. Yet it seems to be a bit different and I got really confused as I thought I was in the other palace. The main gate (from the south west corner off the park, next to the metro station) will get you to this Palace. The other one is more on the east of the park. You can walk from one palace to the other without getting out from the park. Both of the palaces are really nice but lots of open space thus on sunny day make sure you have a hat otherwise you'll end up with a mild sun stroke."
I went twice to this palace. The palace ground is huge. Well-maintained corridors. It is free for the public on certain holidays. Check the official website. I rented a hanbok and therefore I got in for free.
"The Palace is interesting to visit, and easy to get to. I was on a business trip so very little time for sight-seeing so the Palace was a place that I could take some time out to see."
"I love this palace much more than Cheongbokung Palace. This is more interesting, near secret garden and Hanok Village. It is very easy to go by MRT or Airport Bus limousine."
"We took a half day walking tour that included the old town and the palace. The architectural features of the palace and the history, along with stories of the royal family, made this a must see."
"Worth a visit if you are a history or nature lover. Changedeokgung Palace is one of the UNESCO World Heritage, which was built in 1405 by the king of the Joseon Dynasty. The architectural style is simple and frugal. Behind the palace, there is a Secret Garden which was intended the use of the royal family. It is a beautiful and spacious built landscape. The ticket center staff could not speak English well. Please be prepared it may take longer time than expected to buy the ticket. As I visited during the windy day, part of the Secret Garden was closed. Remember to check before you go."
"This is a very best place to visit in Seoul. However, to see the secret garden inside you need a reservation. This will be filled maybe two weeks prior to your visit. They have an internet site. You need to use this first. They have a few English reservation time slots."
"While not the biggest palace- this is probably the most visited of the 5 palaces in Seoul. While the biggest palace- Gyeong-bok-gung (Gung means palace), Chang-deok-gung was the most preferred palace of the king and his queens, chiefly for one reason- the SECRET GARDEN, which covers ~60% of the total palace area. While the palace itself can be entered with a ticket of KRW 3,000 and without a guide, the secret garden has a separate entrance within the palace (and ticket) and can only be accessed with a guide. Each guided tour lasts 90 minutes and tours are run in English and Korean languages (there might be other languages, but am sorry not sure about which ones, maybe Chinese & Japanese as well). The palace itself is open from 9AM to 5PM on all days (Mondays closed).

Another important piece of advice- each tour has a cap of 100 joiners and while there are 3-4 English and 4 Korean tours every day (except Mondays) and they sell our pretty fast; apparently 50 passes per tour can also be booked online, though I haven’t tried it personally. So unless you are staying for a few days and want to try your luck, try booking the pass in advance. A palace-cum-garden ticket can be obtained at the main entrance for KRW 8,000.

I actually missed the Sunday 3:30 PM (last English tour) and was almost disappointed until I came out and realised that there were 2 Korean tours available for 4 PM and 4:30 PM (ending at 5:30 and 6 PM, even though main gates shut at 5 for new entrants). As it was the last free day I had in Seoul I joined the Korean tour, which was the second best option. Really enjoyed the stunning beauty and grandeur of the secret garden, complete with small ponds with large umbrella-esque shelters for the royalty to sit by, waterfalls, and beautiful halls inside, not to mention flower beds and courtyards. And, the Korean guide realised that I had missed the English tour and was kind enough to summarise the brief to me after others had been informed and given time to click pictures.

A must-do in Seoul, apart from Gyeong-bok-gung (for the Change of Guard ceremony at 10 AM & 2 PM daily except Tuesdays when it is closed)."
"I dived this area in 3 party one is the palace 2nd is old city behind it and lake area, total you need 3 to 4 hours to see, They have guard changing ceremony in each 4 hours so make sure you can see that, its really leave a historical impact on your memories. walking distance from city hall and 30 min walk from main shopping area."
"The palace is similar to Gyeongbokgung Palace, but on recommendation from our Korean friend, we also visited the Secret Garden. It was a nice walk(little hike) at the garden with the guide telling the garden stories. The tour would take around 90 min.

If you buy the combination ticket (10k won), the entrance fee for Secret Garden is included, though you need to exchange the voucher for the official ticket at the ticketing box."
"Great gardens all around this palace, lovely colourful azaleas while we were there in April. Nice little oasis away from hustle and bustle of the busy city. Free entry if over 65 and no ID proof required"
"With little to actually ""do"" inside this place is not meant for the easily entertained. Take your time, explore the beauty of the buildings, take in the quietness that it offers in the hectic city and most importantly enjoy your time, slowly..."
Great palace with a big beautiful garden. We did English tour for both the palace and the garden. The tourguide for the palace was very good and i learned a lot. I got little out from the tourguide for the garden but I believe you can't just wander around by yourself in the garden so it is mandatory. The garden is beautiful so worth doing it.
I booked the secret garden tour and the guide is very funny and nice. He explained a lot of things in a fun way.
"when I.pass here they got celebration
can wear the traditional costume for.free
so nicee

hopes next time will get.this.chance also"
Buy the combination ticket which is valid for three months. The place offers free tours in multiple languages twice a day. I was part of the morning English tour which was very informative.
"A perfect palace to visit if you have only limited time. Entry price includes a tour at set times for various languages. Well worth it. If you can spare the 1.5 hrs for a Secret Garden tour, the other tourists say this is well worth it. Well maintained and lovely grounds with a rich Korean history."
"The second most important palace in Seoul, still worth a visit. Can't say I noticed anything special about it when I was there, it's less crowded than Gyeongbokgung."
"Most beautiful, I liked this one the most! The Secret Garden inside the palace is worth of visit too, just reserve your tickets online week before, the amount of visitors is limited. But palace area is huge and beautiful"
Not a bad place to spend an hour although it lacked much to do once inside. Some good restaurants close by though! Worth a visit if bored.
"Have been to Seoul a few times already but this time was the first time I had visited this palace. We opted for the additional Secret Garden tour. I am so glad I did, as the gardens were truly beautiful. The gardens can only be viewed by taking part in the guided tour. It was conducted by a quide who's english was clear and easy to understand. She was quite humourous and informative throughout.

The only thing I would say is that the tour lasts for 1.5hours and involves some inclines, so comfortable walking shoes are a must.
Definitely worth a visit."
"The highlight of Changdeokgung has got to be the Secret Garden, which must be visited with a guide and lasts 90 minutes with small breaks in between.The walk won't be easy for someone who has knee problems as it will have about 3 short but steep trails to hike. General palace admission including the Secret Garden costs ₩8,000 and it is closed on Mondays. Please make an online reservation for your tickets from their official website as it runs out fast."
The palace is interesting but the garden is the real reason for the visit. The English tour was well delivered by a woman that had excellent knowledge and great command of the English language. We timed it well during the spring foliage season. I would imagine that it may be less dramatic during a dry season.
"I went to Gyeongbokgung palace before I came here. We could walk there, but we used the Gyeongbokgung station to Anguk station instead, from here, we walk along Bukchon Hanok Village, then straight to Changdeokgung. (we bought combination tickets for 4 palaces and Jongmyo Shrine, and I was surprised these include the Secret Garden in this palace, otherwise we need to pay extra 5000₩ for the tour)

I think it is more well preserved than the Gyeongbokgung palace. I love this place more, you can walk along the path of the ancient people of Korea and the Royals used to walk. Personally, it was an amazing experience for me. Some of my friends got tired easy though, I guess it's not for everyone.
Lots of picture taking activity."
"We came here on Tuesday because the Main Palace was closed that day. Nevertheless, this palace is quite lovely to visit and explore its beautiful exteriors.

This palace was close to Buchon Hanok Village, so that was our next stop that day."
"We had visited the Geongbokgung Palace the last visit and thought we needed to view the Secret Garden and naturally visit Changdeokgung Palace. The palace is rather small and the highlight would the garden.For this you have to go on the website and make a booking. We chose to go on Christmas Day thinking it would be quiet but our group was large, at least 30 (sure reminds of my school trips!). Give yourself half an hour to visit the actual palace itself. I loved the garden as it was huge, sitting in an area much bigger than the palace. It was a hunting ground for the king in the olden days so as to give you an idea how large it was. It is an oasis of calm in the midst of Seoul! However, you can only visit with a guide and therefore cannot enjoy it as much as it should be. I love to sit and watch the world go by so that is not possible. Lovely and well worth a visit."
"This palace is not as big and extensive as Gyeongbuk-gung palace but has a lot of charm. It is part of the Secret garden complex that can only be seen with a tour group (at the palace ticket counters about W5,000) There are both korean and English tours but they do sell out fast over weekends with good weather."
"If you have seen Gyeongbokgung Palace, you don't necessarily have to see Changdeokgung Palace but you go there drive-by style on your way to the Secret Garden, which is highly recommendable. Mind you access to the garden is by guided tour only so make sure to check out the opening hours."
"Constructed in 1405 this magnificent palace can be visited without a tour guide. Leave at least one hour to do so.
There is a secret garden which can be visited only with a tour guide and lasts one and a half hour and costs 5000 won. Find out ahead of time when the visit is available. The information about the garden is worth the visit.
The palace is free to those people 65 and older."
"We went by the place very quickly on our way to the Secret Garden. The garden was pretty and it was interesting to see where the royals relaxed, entertained guests and where the prince studied. The garden would be more beautiful during the fall foliage or the spring/summer bloom. The tour was 90 min and require quite a bit of walking and some stairs. Would not recommend for those with difficulty walking. The guide was quite knowledgable and shared some good information."
"Worth the visit ,the guard change and tradionally dresses are splendid
Love the park that surrounds the temples
The archictecture ,the clean gardens and the eyecatcher of south korea"
"Very nice palace with its traditional architecture
Beautiful flowery garden around the palace.
Entrance fee of 1000 Korean won"
"One of the important palaces in Seoul, and a UNESCO world heritage site, this is surely a must-visit! Take some time to walk around the palace grounds and see the different areas of the palace."
"The park contains large number og interesting buildings. As a european, I learned a lot of the buildings, and culture, thanks to the signs written in English"
Only spend less than 2 hours as it was pretty rushed for time. Visited some of the prominent attractions and there were sakura trees in sight at this point of the year as well. Probably need to spend one full day at this attraction in order to give a more accurate rating.
Nice place to see and walk around. Very peaceful and serene. Not much to do here except take in the history
"Interesting place, be sure to check the website for times of the free tours. They are very interesting and informative. If you aren't able to get that, there are good english explanations around.

The secret garden was also quite beautiful- you must book online or get there early to ensure spaces don't run out."
The palaces were so beautiful but practically enjoyed Changdeokgung because of the spring flowers and Cherry blossoms outside. I can't recommend the Secret Garden tour for those who are not fit or elderly though as it is really a struggle. We went there early April so the trees are still bare and there were only few spring flowers here and there. Still it was a nice experience.
"A very lovely palace indeed. If you are going to visit, must see the Secret Garden, which can only be accessed thru a group tour. These are in limited # so you must sign up in advance! Just sign up online at the official palace website. It was very easy! This palace is full of history and no wonder they sealed off a portion of the palace grounds to general public to preserve its history and architecture."
"Changdeokgung is the most unique Korean palace built in harmony with landscape. No doubt this is one of the kings of Joseon favorite palace because of the spacious and beautiful Secret Garden.

This palace closed on Monday.

Most stop:

Injeongjeon Hall - the throne hall

Seonjeongjeon Hall - the only structure remaining at Changdeokgung with blue glazed roof tiles

Huijeongdang - the King's Residence

Daejojeon - the Queen's Residence

Nakseonjae Complex - built for King Heonjong's beloved concubine

The Secret Garden - it takes up almost 60% of the entire area of the palace. (additional admission charges if you want to visit this Garden), advice to visit this garden during autumn for more colorful view. Only guided tour are available in the secret garden."
"My wife and I spent a little over 3 hours here including the Secret Garden tour. We guided ourselves through the main palace area using the maps and posted signs. It was very interesting to try and imagine what life was like hundreds of years ago in such a place. The Secret Garden is a very nice add on and is guide led. Our group was rather large, but once you start walking around it seems smaller. The guide was informative but gave us plenty of time to explore each stop. There were some hills involved so be wary if you have trouble walking on inclines."
"Out of the 3 palaces I've seen this one was my favorite, make sure to catch the ceremony at 16:00. There is also an art gallery in the palace. And since it is a smaller palace less people come here so not as crowded."
"This was on the 5 hr free tour from INC Airport in Korea. As a transit passenger, all you do is show your tkts and most of the 2-3hr tours are free. This one was $10US, but included entrance fees and a very nice lunch. I would highly rec and to book on line or get to airport before 7:30am and get on a waiting list."
"We did this as part of a tour, and the place is wonderful. The history and culture of the place is impressive and with a knowledgeable guide is a great way to learn about this wonderful countries history. Great day out."
"This is an interesting place, although not as impressive as those in other Asian countries. It is somewhat maze like, with several building scattered over a wide area. I strongly recommend setting aside at least 3 hours to visit the whole complex."
"The colors on the inside of the main temple were impressive but the rest of the grounds were not that impressive. There is a museum right next door (we wandered into it from the palace grounds) that I really enjoyed. If you find that, go in! it's air conditioned."
"I found Chandeokgung to be the most beautiful of all the palaces--and I visited them all! I took two free English-language tours. The first one--a tour of of the buildings and explanation of the history was very hood. The second tour--of the Secret Garden--was only okay. I could barely understand the guide and the Secret Garden was pleasant--but not as impressive as the name conjured. But I was there just before spring, and I suspect it would have been much prettier with the flowers blooming and the trees leafing out. But the palace was ""WOW!"""
"This is more Korean style palace. That is, it is built according to the nature. The other one - Gyeongbokgung - is more Chinese style which gates and building are all lined up. Even the main gate for this palace is situated in the corner. And they didn't cut down on hills and trees. So it's pretty much of hiking in the city if you take the full course. The palace part is open to everyone except every Mondays, but the secret garden - something more famous - must be reserved beforehand. If you are a small group, there usually are some tickets available at the spot, but I wouldn't risk it. Just reserve it online first. The garden is beautiful and huge and the hills are haha endless. Better wear sneakers. No tough shoes."
"The palace was pretty nice. This was the only palace I visited in Seoul so I have no other comparisons.

One strong word of advice is that if you are not fit, elderly, need assistance with walking, or you have toddlers, prams and such, do not take the ""Secret Garden tour"".

Before the tour started, we heard someone ask the palace tour guide if there were a lot of slopes and he replied that it was mainly gentle gradient. This was not true. The slopes were steep! Coming down was easy but going up was a struggle for quite a few people. There were also steep stairs made of rocks which you need to climb. Certainly not advisable for those with strollers."
"Don't miss this one. It's not just another palace, it's the most beautiful one in Seoul. The buildings are incredibly charming. Make sure you book a tour for the adjacent secret garden (can't enter without a tour) as that will blow your mind -- it is gorgeous!"
"This place is fantastic. Took me 2 hours to see it all, it's a very big property with the palace, hall, queens room, secret gardens and lake park. Built in the 1400's, take a moment to read each plaque so you know what you are looking at."
"The palace itself is not so interesting since there is very few information and you can only explore the outside. Secret Garden tour is the highlight, well preserved place, beautiful nature, informative guide."
"From the colorful wood under the roof tops to the blue glazed roof tiles of Seonjeongjeon Hall, you can I agine the staely glory of The old ways and times. The King's residence is in Huijeogdang Hall where he a!so worked. You can picture him sitting in the throne Hall.

Well worth a visit as are the
Grounds. The gardens and flowers were absolutely beautiful."
Great palace great history I loved going round this palace with its pinks blossoms and it's decorative work and sculptures dragons and monkeys took me well back in time
"Nice place to walk around and enjoy history. Only costs ~$3 to get in, more for access to the secret garden. Unfortunately, I arrived around 4pm on a Sunday and the secret garden was already sold out for the day. So if you want to go, make sure to get there before mid-afternoon!"
"managed to join the english free tour guide here, very interesting, but have less time to take photos while following the tour. went to the secret garden too but probably wrong timing, flowers are yet to bloom so the garden is still quite bare.. interesting mix of korea + western culture, can see european furnitures in the palace"
"The castle was okay but not mesmerising for me. If you are into castles and history, China will be a better country to visit."
"If it's a UNESCO site, it's always worth a visit. Changdeokgung lets you see how the palaces were in the olden times. A very historic place that has been kept fairly well. Not a lot of artifacts but the building structures and surrounding shrubbery make for a very nice walk in the afternoon."
"Guided tour is very informative. Since the secret garden is very large, you want to follow a guide. It is recommended to book the tour ahead as this is very popular. If you start the tour at 3:30 (the last tour), you won't have enough time to see the buildings. So plan to see the buildings first before you to go to the secret garden. After walking around the garden you will be too tired too!"
"Upon entering through the gate there are various paths through the different groups of buildings. Its all kept very well with some signage in English. Lovely atmosphere; also great book- & souvenir shop. Enjoyed a good cup of tea here, too.
Don't miss the Secret Garden, which makes up most of the space behind the buildings. You need to go on a guided tour (English is offered) to enter. You can get the tickets together with your general tickets or at the booth just before the entry to the Garden.The Garden is not suitable for wheelchairs!"
We were out walking around and happened to catch the changing of the guard. It is a really interesting site to see and hear. The grounds are also beautiful with the cherry blossom trees in bloom.
"This Palace is similar (to my eyes!) but nicer than Gyeongbokgung. The buildings are really splendid and the gardens around very pleasant (blossoming these days with zillions of Korean teenagers in traditional costume spending the day to make selfies.....).Overall a similar sense of emptiness is nevertheless also present. These palaces are empty or closed... so despite thence architecture, it's like walking around something you'd like to (really) visit but can't. A bit frustrating. Nice place though."
"The entrance ticket can be bought online. It is a bit crowded to come here during cherry blossoms season.
It is better to visit the Secret Garden during the autumn, not spring T.T"
"This place is one of an old palaces in Seoul, Korea. I recommend you to visit this palace in day time to see beautiful architecture."
"This Palace ground may not be as big as the Gyeongbokgung Palace but its Secret Garden behind is more fascinating. I would certainly come back again during autumn especially in early November to see the beautiful hues of the autumn leaves. We were there in late gloomy March and could only see few branches of cherry blossom. Be there at the right season to really appreciate its beauty!.

Getting there is easy - about 400m walk from the Orang Line 3 Anguk Station. Entrance fee is 3,000KRW for just the Palace visit. Add another 5,000KRW if you want to visit the Secret Garden. Don't miss the Secret Garden as it is more interesting. Join the 90mins free tour to get a better understanding of the Secret Garden. This Garden is bigger than the Palace proper. You could also join a night tour of the Garden through advance booking. Happy Walking!!!

After the Palace visit, you could visit the nearby Bukchon to see the picturesque hanoks."
"We had been to many similar palace's during our Asia trip, so we only noticed subtle differences. It felt like we were seeing much of the same from what we saw prior in China and Japan. Not taking anything away from the site, it was a great experience and well kept. If you havent seen one of these palace's before and you are in the area, worth the visit."
"Bigger than we expected! Plenty of quiet corners to appreciate despite the many tourists, best to get a personal Guide to enjoy the architecture and history of the palace."
"Interesting place to visit, very cheap, I think 100 won each. Wear trainers as it's quite a big site. Toilet facilities are available."
i went there just in time when the guards were marching with their national outfits. it was cool! the place was easily accessed when you travel by train or with the hop on and off bus.
"Seeing the garden is by tour only. We brought tickets for the palace and gardens when we arrived in the afternoon but because of the afternoon garden tour time we didn't get a chance to see the palace. We found the garden disappointing during our visit in late March. There was not much colour. Maybe it looks more attractive at other times of the year? We felt the tour guide did little more than walk us from one photo opportunity to another, and also felt the tour could have been done in half the time."
I recommend this place to dress up and get some Korean style pictures on a sunny day. The old palace is the perfect setting for some great compositions of memorable pictures
"After visiting Gyeongbokgung, Changdeokgung is nothing too grand. The Secret Garden is the highlight of this place, so make sure you make your reservation online (no booking/admission payment required until ticket redemption at the booth). They are very strict with the timing so do arrive 20 minutes before the tour time. We were 10 minutes earlier and we had to join the next session.

It was early Spring time and the flowers hasn't bloomed so the secret garden wasn't at its prettiest. The place is very mystical, scenic and calming, ZEN. Our tour guide was super sassy, entertaining in a way.

There'll be alot of walking so make sure you're in proper walking shoes!"
"If you have been to gyeongbukgong, you might feel that this is just another palace. However, this palace has a different feel from that of gyeongbukgong. It feels less imposing. To me, the main attraction was the rear garden of the palace. It's a little oasis right in the middle of Seoul city! Be sure to book the tour of the rear garden beforehand or to arrive in time for the guided tour of the secret garden. It's a long but enjoyable walk. Good walking shoes are definitely recommended!"
"We decided to visit this palace instead of Gyeongbokgung mainly so we could visit the Secret Garden. The palace itself is not that large. It was peaceful walking through the complex as there were not a lot of tourists. However you couldnt enter into any of the buildings and only on occasion, get a peek into the rooms. If you like architecture then this is for you."
"While being able to listen to how courts people lived in the days thorugh an audio interface in english (be sure to grab it near the ticket office.), the place is overburdened with tourists. I recommend moving to the back of the palace to avoid crowd and then directly to the tallest building, which has a folk museum near it."
"The Palace and its grounds were sprawling. To think South Korea is not huge. So many nook and crannies to explore. Interesting short and different shaped doors; sections of the palace and quarters for their staff. How many people used to live there? - uhhhmm. It is quite a walk, so be prepared to wear comfortable shoes and recommend doing this in the morning when it is less warm/hot. It's a shame they cordoned off going inside the rooms for a better look up-close, but I guess the government has its reason for doing so. Famous sites including their theme park Everland via train/subway is doable; make sure you ask for directions on what train to take and inform them of your destination and ask if the place is open on that particular day. Plan your trips so you can maximize to see the sites once you are in a certain area in South Korea specially if you are there for a short stay like us - 5 days 4 nights.."
"It's nice to walk around during the day time.

Peaceful place which located in the centre of Seoul.

Walking distance from Anguk subway station.

Make sure join the free guided tour.

To visit the secret garden, you have to buy another ticket, which they sell limited number of tickets available to access to certain time. 1.5 hour walking guided tour. Make sure you wear comfortable walking shoes due to you have to walk up the hill"
This very pretty palace looks like it is one of the best kept of the five royal palaces. Worth seeing and walking through.
"Though not huge like the castles and palaces in Europe, the palace grounds were tranquil and spacious. The Secret Garden is a must see, with its beautiful pavilions and ponds. The hilly terrain is not recommended for those with knee problems though. Our tour guide was Kim, who was beautiful and eloquent.
I wish I could spend more time here, it was probably the highlight of my Korea trip."
This was an interesting palace but we didn't spend very much time here because we were so short of time. I would like to be able to visit it again.
"Visit this place and buy the package. The place is worth the visit. Look at it in the perspective of history. We went here in winter but there is a bit foliage,"
"Though not as huge as gyeongbok palace, Changdeokgung has a more romantic feel to me. I actually prefer this palace.

Unfortunately, we missed the free English guide to this palace, so our information was limited to those written on the boards located outside the buildings.

But since I'm a fan of periodic dramas, I was able to roughly put together a nice story for my family ... though there were complains about my version :)

We were too late for the Secret Garden, but we did not mind it since it is still winter, so most of the trees are still bare.

I definitely recommend a visit here .... it's not Seoul if you did not visit the palaces."
"This Palace gives you two visits for the price of one (well, not really - you need to buy a ticket to see the secret garden too), so if you can only fit in one Palace in Seoul, this one might be for you.
However, it is also right next door to Changgyeonggung Palace too, with an adjoining entry, so you might squeeze that one in too.
We bought a combined ticket, which covered all four Palaces, the secret garden, and Jongmyo Shrine, and saved us money.
Be sure you check opening hours - the Palaces and Shrine are not open every day.
The Palace at Changdeokgung - you can walk around that by yourself, or go on a guided tour (do some research, as this doesn't apply year-round). It has toilets and a café, and pretty gardens without having to go into the secret gardens. When we were there (the last week of March, 2016), the blossoms were just starting to come out on the trees - in one or two weeks time, it would have been sensational!
As regards the secret gardens, a tour needs to be booked (and they do it in Korean, Japanese, Chinese or English at various times of the day). We arrived about half an hour before the first English tour (11:30am), and it was already fully booked, so immediately booked the next one at 1:30pm. Note: there are good coffee and food shops in the vicinity!). So you can't go into the secret garden without a guide. The guide stops in about 4 places, explains them, and then gives you about 10 minutes to wander around by yourself. The ""secret"" aspect to ""the secret garden"" is that only the King and his mates could enter them. There's some pretty pagodas and other buildings for resting, eating and cooking (King's gotta eat!), water features, and gardens. And also a couple of relatively steep slopes in case you were wondering.
All very pretty."
"Quiet surprise this palace still kept in good shape, a nice place for photos shooting. The changing guard show really interesting."
"Our Viator guide was excellent. Wear comfortable shoes as there is a lot of walking. The ""changing of the guards"" is a bit hokey as there is no one to guard anymore but it is still something to see. The ingenuity of the Koreans to ""invent"" central heat was pretty neat. I can only imagine that the entire grounds will be covered in flowers within a few months."
"Love this place. I saw the changing guards and have a chance to take pictures with them. I paid about $5 to get inside. The place has some young men and women dressed in Korea outfit to walk around and stopped for pictures. They are love birds and felt that I was back to the pass and was walking in the palace hundreds of years ago. Not crowded at all, and it was pleasant to walk around. The trees was so nice and the short explore was a much do in Korea."
My cousins took us here. Very nice palace. The secret gardens were the best part of the tour. Go during the spring.
"Worth a visit, especially when guards change. We just walked through, but you can stay there for longer and get some insights about the palace and history"
"This palace is just a short walk from the Anguk metro station on Line 3 and general admission is 3,000 KRW (less than $3). There are several excellent free tours conducted in English offered throughout the day which last approximately one hour and are well worth planning your visit around. When you're done with the palace, head right next door to Bukchon Hanok for lunch. Note that this palace is closed on Mondays."
Nice big palace. Impressive grounds. Change of guards was very nice and colorful. Good place to spend a few hours.
"If you don't have enough time to go visit all the palaces you just need to do one- come visit the changdeokgung palace, especially the secret garden tour (guided tour only book separately). Had a great time here, the best among the palaces in Seoul."
"We only visited one palace during our trip to Korea. The area is huge and we spent lots of time just taking in all the grandeur. It's easy to reach the place by public transportation. Since we booked at a nearby place, it was a pleasant three minute walk to this palace. Our 7 year old had a grand time running around and pretending to be palace guard."
"Impressive in that the architecture has been preserved and the grounds are really expansive.

If you watch the changing of the guard, look for the mustache. They're stuck on. Great show."
"Now this is a palace! Like many things in Seoul, Changdeokgung is quite easy to get to by public transport. Korean architechture is very distinct and these structures won't disapoint."
"Hi all,

The palace was huge and the guard wearing old century dress who was standing at the main gate of the palace was told they must stand minimum 2hours to change new shift and my children's love taking photos with them"
"Had a great day and an awesome tour in the secret garden , that is actualy hudge and more than worth it."
"To enjoy this marvelous palace, I recommend a guided tour which not only adds to the enjoyment but also provides many hidden stories of this palace and how it all ties to the history of Korea. Even without the tour guide, the ground is gorgeous and you can get lost several hours in there. If I were to choose one royal palace to visit in Seoul, this would be the one."
"When I arrived at the site there was an hour left till the 1:30pm English tour. So to avoid the possible crowd I started to checkout the place and take photos. The size of palace is miniature compare to all others, which makes this one ideal as an 'introduction' or 'summary' of korea's nearest historical governance.

My tour guide, Tian, knows the history well and is able to answer my questions about the palace, Korean history, and the emperor family. She was able to condense the tour to 30min for me to witness the guard exchange presentation at the gate by 2pm.

Yes I recommend this place."
ENjoy the ceremony of the changing of the guard where real Korean's are the actors dressed in their ceremonial garb.
"This site is great for history and nature lovers. I highly recommend going on the guided tour of the gardens. Otherwise, you'll only see a fraction of what this palace has to offer."
Beautiful architecture and wonderful history. Be sure to go with a guide so you can get an overall feel of the history of this palace.
"This is one of the most beautiful palaces I have visited. It's nice and easy to walk around in, and your idea and understanding of ancient Korea will be completed. A wonderful sight they you must check out in Seoul and spend lots of time walking around and just enjoying it."
If you go here purcahse the tour it is well worth it. We had the greatest time. When someone explains everything to you it is better!!
"Amazing palace that should not be missed. We took the guided tour which led us around all the buildings as well as the ""secret"" garden area out behind the palace. Such beauty....you can understand why the king kept it for himself!"
"Had a few hours to kill so I went to the Changdeokgung Palace to walk around. Went on the garden tour which was muddy and not very interesting. The walking areas are sandy dirt, so plan accordingly as your shoes will be a mess when you leave. It had rained/snowed a few days before my visit and the grounds were not in great shape. Worth going, but probably much nicer in spring and summer. I would not pay extra for the garden tour in the winter as there is not much to see."
The setting is beautiful with the gardens and trees. The palace is set according to the topography and is focused on harmony. So it wa out of the norm. Winter is a good time to go and you may see many young people in traditional clothing on a Sunday.
"I had a lovely day out at Changdeokgung Palace. I got the palace combo ticket which allows entry into a few palaces in Seoul and a Shrine. So if you're wanting to visit a few I would recommend getting the combo. I think this attraction is best visited in Spring time because the gardens in the palace look beautiful during these months. It's also sunny, warm days and blue skies so probably the best time for a long walk around the palace and gardens. This palace has the secret gardens which are lovely. It's a great palace to visit for nice walks and good photos ops."
i went a few times over the year to this place for the night tour which happens in the autumn and spring months. its affordable and maybe the prettiest by night of all the palaces.
"A must visit venue, English speaking guides - need to book in advance. Guided tour lasts about 1.5 hours, but you can spend lost more time there enjoying the history and the heritage."
This was great. I am positive it would be prettier in the summer months with flowers etc. The young wear proper uniforms and dress to visit. The guards do something every day i think at 3pm
A small brother of the forbidden city in Bejing. The buildings are well preserved and it's a pleasure to wander around this complex of palaces. You will meet a lot of locals in authentic clothing!
"I like this palace. There was a group of 15 tourists in the tour...guide was fine and eager to explain every details. God palace was huge and even with many tourists, one did not feel crowded. I loved the sights of many young Korean ladies dressed up their traditional attire to be photographed by friends...giggling and smiling...very nice. I recommend the place for a slow stroll!"
Historical place. Accessible. Very colorful guard. Cool and quiet place to walk. Safe. Nice to see lots of students in traditional Korean costumes.
"Changdeokgung is not as big as Gyeongbokgung, but this palace is more quiet in terms of tourist flow than Gyeongbokgung. If you come early on the morning, you hear the birds singing and hear the nice sound of the wind, so if you are a nature lover this is your spot. The entrance admission is 3000 KRW (3 USD), so it is the same as Gyeongbokgung.

Overall, this is my favorite Korean palace, not only because it is a World Heritage, but because it has a good blend of being for tourists and locals. Also, the architecture is more trendy and the palace itself has a more clear path to look around.

Good location, located around 5 minutes from the Anguk metro station.
TIP: Closed on Mondays. It may get busy on Tuesdays, because Gyeongbokgung is closed on that day."
"Smaller and less powerful presence than the main palace, but more beautiful and peaceful atmosphere. Once inside, hard to imagine one is in a large, modern city. Great contrast to the other palaces."
"This was my first Palace visit in Seoul. I bought the combined toicket for all palaces and the Secret Garden for 10,000 KRW. Had a guidded tour in English of the Palace (aprox. 45 minutes) and another tour of the Secret Garden (aprox. 1h30 ). Tours are free, guides were very interesting, just be sure to be there for the English Tour (there are a couple a day only). The venue is not as crowded as Gyongbokgung Palace."
"If you are staying in Seoul for a few days or weeks you are best buying the multi ticket for 5 of the palaces and entry to the secret garden. Again there are free guided tours that are well worth the money of the entrance fee. But be aware, if you have the multi ticket you still have to queue up to exchange the ticket you have for an entrance ticket.

Like the other palaces a lot of the buildings are new representations of what used to be there but there are some original ones. The signs against all of the buildings explain their purposes well too.

No food is allowed to be taken into Changdeokgung Palace and there is nowhere to purchase any food of any kind. There is a tea shop but it does only sell tea and coffee. Great tea but no nibbles."
"It became my favorite palace in Seoul! I loveeee the nature, old and preserve architecture it has. I can spend hours just looking around the stunning view.. They have guided tour in some languages too, make sure you go in the time :)"
The palace is well preserved and there are free tours to guide you round. It is just a short distance from train station. There is a palace guard changing ceremony here and you can check from the net on the ceremony time. Those who watch alot of korean drama should at least visit this place for once!
"Worth going on a guided tour. Very interesting and beautiful gardens. Takes around an hour to get around and I'd recommend comfy shoes, not the suit and work shoes I was wearing!"
"To really appreciate Korean culture, I wanted to visit this amazing palace and immerse myself in the ornate beauty. I was not disappointed. The guards are dressed in ancient style finery and allow you to have pictures taken with them. Inside, you walk through one palace to another and can take photos of the interiors, which are dazzling. It's especially nice to do this on a day with good weather as it requires quite a lot of walking outdoors."
"it was great to know some of the history of south korea, greet place, all tourist like to visit it, i suggest to take a tour operator to save time, it was like a dream"
"Should pay a visit to the palace, the only one palace in Korea that has Western architecture, and make your time to observe the gate exchange session as well, very happening & nice cultural experience."
"THE GOOD

I like the fact that they really preserve the place. They did a little renovation to preserve the place. Aside from stairs they have ramp for baby's stroller. Clean comfort room.

I like the history of Korea that is why I enjoy the place, but if you are not, don't go.

We are lucky that our Tour Specialist is very knowledgeable and was able to explain everything. every corner of the palace have their reason and purpose.

NEED TO IMPROVE

nothing! I like it just the way it is. very old and preserve."
For me this was palace number 2 in Seoul. Interesting and certainly worth a visit. If you haven't been there yet join one of the guided tours as certainly the guide can tell a lot about the history of the palace and the use of the different building within the outer walls.
"This palace is gorgeous, even in winter. Definitely take a tour, and stick it out, even in the cold! The buildings are beautiful, both i side and out!"
"Abolutely wonderful! This Palace is also called "" The East Palace"" according with its location with the Gyeongbokung Palace. One of the 5 Main palaces in Seoul, the different pavillions have been restored after several fires , but they say, very similar as they were before, and have very colorful decorations. I recalled one in particular, with its roof with beautiful Blue tiles..... splendorous! And the paintings in the Hall of the throne...: amazing! At the end of March, the Cherry trees were NOT yet in full bloom, only a few of them, son I would recommend you to visit this outstanding site in the first or second week of April. ( I was a little mixed up and thought this Palace had the changing of the guard, but is NOT in this one , but in the Gyeongbukung Palace). Highly recommended attraction for everyone!"
Book via website in advance the secret garden tour it's worth every won. It just require a lot of walking and uphill climb.
i visted Changdeokgung Palace in summer and visit the secret garden. Feel in touch with Korean culture. they have various language guides to give the knowledge when you visited the secret garden.
창덕궁 a/k/a Changdeokgung is a magnificent palace property. It's been well maintained and is a fantastic historic UNESCO site. The Secret Garden is a must and is stunning. Our visit was actually in Oct. 2014. I'm looking firward to taking my daughter and granddaughter.
"Superb palace, magnificient buildings, pagodas, temple, kiosks. Also not to be missed is the secret garden. A very nice walk through ponds, trees and of course buildings."
"This was a nice Palace, we were fortunate as there was a ""changing of the guard"" ceremony going on that was entertaining(and free)."
Be prepared for lots of uphill and down hill walking here. Lovely scenes for different seasons. Has a huge garden inside which is the main attraction.
Well preserved and stunning architecture - colorful buildings with many interesting details. Peaceful
"We enjoyed our time there but it was a very long day. They only have three English tours per day of the Secret Garden area. You're only allowed to see those 75 acres during a tour. If you are not physically fit, this part may not be the place for you. It involves lots of walking, most up hills or stairs. It was 90 minutes long and we had to wait 3 hours before the tour began (we walked around the ""castle"" and its surrounding buildings. It was interesting if you're a history buff like my husband. I definitely don't recommend it with children."
"This palace occupies a large tract of land like all palaces of importance should. What you find here is only the empty structure, suppose the secret garden would have made this more agreeable, but we were have no intention to wait for guided tour, and additonal cost to visit."
"If you want to indulge yourself with historic events when you travel Seoul, do not forget to include Changdeokgung Palace in your itinerary. It is surprising how they preserved the Palace after hundreds of years. The vibrant details of the roofs, the cornerstones, even the passageways remain the same as it was before. The place is so huge you'd get tired to tour around it for just one day, but it's definitely rewarding if you do. Let your imagination play the game while you are in Changdeokgung Palace!"
"We visited Changdeokgung Palace on a whim as it was nearby our guesthouse, and we also woke up a bit late and missed the changing of guards at Gyeongbokgung. We had no regrets. We visited on the last Wednesday of the month and got free entrance into the palace (though still needed to pay for the Huwon entrance).

The place provides free guided tours at the entrance. Just find the language you want and go ahead and join it (if you haven't already pre-booked a tour). Didn't join the Huwon tour though coz we were catching a train to the outskirts.

Anyway, it's true. The palace is lovely in winter with snow scattered on the pathways. :)"
The Palace highlight is its Secret Garden. The Architecture was great but the Garden stole the show. Magnificently quiet and calm. It will give you a glimpse on how the Korean royals spend their time inside this beautiful but enclose structure.
A wonderful place with amazing buildings. The garden was gorgeous and the intricate work on the roof of each building was so lovely. A great tour guide who explained the history so well.
"The highlight of the place is definitely the tour to the Secret Garden. The other parts won't be anything new if you've already visited Gyeongbokgung.
We visited the place in autumn and the garden was simply amazing."
This is a typical temple of the Korean royalty. But don't miss the special tour of the Secret Garden (it's not a secret).
"This Palace is easily reachable by underground or taxi. Most beautiful trees with red leaves mixing other pine trees were all bald at winter time, so it not as colourful as it is in pictures shot in autumn. All buildings were the same and very plain, may interested those architectural lovers. We attempted to pay fee for the secret garden which must be entered with a tour guide but unfortunately
one only time with a chinese tour guide on sunday, for the whole day, can you imagine
how interested it can be. The palace charge extra money to enter the secret garden but the service is so limited and travellers take so much time to go there. Tour guides in English is also limited. And I did not think I saw any timetable for the secret garden at the main entrance, may be it is a little secret that should not tell travellers. The ticket seller, probably has limited english ability and will just answer the money you need to pay but nothing else. So if you go, it would be better to enquire the tour guide time for the secret garden if you do not want to miss the boat."
Place time and art are amazing. In this huge modern world peace of history is standing and waiting to be explored. Palace is amazing garden looks wonderful and show was breathtaking. Worth going
My husband is Korean. He took me here because he knew of all the palaces this would be my favorite. And it was. It was smaller than the other palaces (but that isn't saying much because this was huge still) I loved it for the natural beauty. It was breath taking. There was a little pond that you would surely miss if you didn't look for it and it was covered in green lily pads. We watched two ducks roam around the waters. This place was a gem in industrial Seoul!
We went here after we visited the Gyeongbokgung Palace since it is close to each other. Its very similar with the Gyeongbokgung Palace. They also have an entrance fee of 3000 won and also offers guided tours. It is also on of the UNESCO heritage site in Korea I guess if you are into architecture and design this is a place to be visited.
"Make sure you do the guided tour and wear Google shoes as there is lots of walking, the gardens are beautiful"
"I was there with a Korean friend who explained the history and how the Korean's lived. It was more enjoyable with a local's perspective, but would be neat to see even with out a ""guide"""
"Awesome to see a huge historic palace is preserved in middle of the busy city, great history and makes you feel you are time travelling back to history!"
"It was a bright sunny minus 18 degrees celsius day when I wandered through the grounds of Changdeokgung Palace. You can't help but pause and consider how small and insiginifcant one individual is when contemplating the life of Kings as you peer into their accomodations and take in the palace grounds, some dating back to late 1300's/early 1400's. The great thing about this Palace was being able to wander and discover all by ourselevs but also the hidden gems we found around corners that could be easily over looked. Take your time and enjoy one of Korea's national treasures and UNESCO listed sites. The entry fee is amazingly small!"
"We wanted to visit because it’s a UNESCO World Heritage Site, but what we really enjoyed was the Huwon or Secret Garden.

General admission ticket to Changdeokgung lets you wander around the main buildings of the Palace. To see the Huwon/Secret Garden, you have to join the compulsory tour with a separate ticket (ticket combines general admission and tour).

The “garden” is really the natural surroundings and wooded area that covers more than half of the Changdeokgung complex. The tour lasts 90 minutes so wear comfortable walking shoes. Also, check for Huwon tour times and what language you want (Korean, English, Chinese, Japanese) and time your visit accordingly to avoid disappointment.

The Huwon/Secret Garden is beautiful in how it was built to blend harmoniously with its natural surroundings. Buildings, pavilions, ponds and gardens are designed around the geography of the land and landscaping is minimal, a stark contrast to the typical palace complex which adopts a grid-like plan.

As beautiful as the gardens are, it’s also rich in history. Your guide will also furnish you with the history of each structure and its purpose, be it library, study, contemplation or banquet.

Overall, Changdeokgung was a more serene palace complex; we wandered around the main buildings and encountered less tourists than elsewhere. And maybe it’s because we like history and nature, but the Huwon/Secret Garden tour made this place a must-see during our visit to Seoul."
Beautiful place. Historic palace in Seoul. Rich in history. Many different buildings many of which were hand painted beautifully made.. Definitely worth checking out while in Seoul.
"Even though Gyeongbokgung get's recommended as the best palace most of the time, I prefer Changdeokgung with it's unique tour through the palace garden (also called ""Secret Garden""). I think I finally managed to see the garden in all 4 seasons and all of them have their own charms."
Best way to explore is to join a free English tour of the palace.The guide introduces the history of the palace and walks you toward the most significant building!
Cater more time to walk about in this palace. Do stay for the hourly change of guards ceremony at the entrance to the palace. This palace is huge and there are a lot of parts of this palace to be explored.
Easy to access and move around. Not as vast as other palaces. Take a guide to gain insights of the culture and to understand historical impact of eras.
"Secret garden is in this palace, you need a guide to access the garden. but the palace itself you don't need a guide. you can just enjoy the time yourself. It is in a walking distance with bukchon hanok village... so you can combine another attraction with this place."
"We visited the Changdeokgung Palace during the Spring.
It was beautiful.
The gardens surrounding this palace are vast and worth visiting as well, so bring good walking shoes.
Make sure to buy tickets before you are planning on entering the premises - there might be a wait, especially if you are planning on joining the guided tour, which I highly recommend.
Tickets can be bought onsite in a small ticket booth."
"The place is amazing. It will need lot of walking but it worth it.
I enjoyed each angle and details of the place."
You must come here! Another favorite! Lots of nooks and crannies to photograph and get photographed in! Shows the true beauty of Korean culture
"The day we visited the palace, it was snowing, Turned the Secret Garden into a fairy tale garden. Beautiful, convenient for wheel chairs and baby strollers. Guides (English) gave good explanations and time to take photos. Book guided tour to Secret Garden online to avoid delay and disappointment."
Palaces are really lovely places to visit in Korea. It was also awesome to visit during Spring as the place is filled with Cherry blossoms
"A beautiful palace close to Anguk station with expansive gardens. Please note that you cannot walk around the secret garden alone and have to visit as part of a tour - English tours can fill up quite quickly so I recommend you go and confirm your time slot, then if you have time to wait you can visit the palace grounds or nearby attractions such as Gyeongbokgung or the Bukchon Hanok village"
"The palace grounds and buildings are very beautiful. There's a lot of walking involved. In the rear of the palace on the north side is the garden area or Biwon. You have to buy a separate ticket or pay for both palace grounds and biwon together. The garden was really interesting and beautiful but understand you'll be walking uphill a lot and can only go during a tour. They don't allow people to wander around by themselves. I dislike tours groups but there was nothing I could do. If you have a lot of time to sightsee around Seoul, try all the palaces. If your time is limited, pick either this one or gyeongbukgung (which is a few blocks away)...it's not worth cramming both into one trip to Seoul. IMO, I would pick gyeongbukgung since you also have the option of visiting 2 museums on the palace grounds as well as lockers to stash your bags. Also #5 line lets you out right under the entrance."
"Plan a few hours in here, the grounds are huge, and there are many nooks and crannies to visit. Best if you bring a guidebook that tells the story of what each section represents. From grandiose main palaces to servant quarters, take your time to soak in the history and beauty of the ancient times and gardens"
This place is full of history. And where a lot of Korea drama are filmed. But not as excited as I thought I would be. It's pretty big but nothing much thou.
"Its worth taking a wander around this palace complex but the experience, for us, was made wonderful by our excursion into the extensive Secret Gardens.

Be aware that it is really important to make reservations for the Secret Gardens online, well in advance. You can pay for the tickets on arrival but get your name down on the lists!"
"Beauty enriched by time. Walking through the palace grounds gives the visitor a sense of ancient Korea especially if you are a fan of Korean period dramas. The entrance is a massive gate adorned with colourful patterns and carvings on wood. Ticket is very reasonable especially if you buy the combination ticket for the five grand palaces of Seoul. This ticket includes the secret garden in this palace as well which I recommend you to see but once you reach the pavilion with the pond where the souvenir shop is you may stop there because the rest will be a long walk with tree lined uphill path and some more pavilion, nothing else. The Injeongjeon Hall is the throne hall of the palace. There are also small buildings which good picture backgrounds with less people like the Huijeongdang Hall. A map of the palace is essential."
"When I stepped in, I can't believe that I was actually at a place where I always watched this in Korean drama. It felt surreal!!! It was indescribable. The place is rich in history and makes me feel like I was brought back to time during those days. It is a place where Korean drama fans should not skip! Worth the trip."
"Smaller and more compact than the Gyeongbukgong Palace, but with access (for a small additional charge) to the this palace gardens."
We chose to go to this Palace over Gyeongbokgung based on recommendations by others. We took the Secret Garden tour which gave us a better understanding of the lives of the kings who resided in this palace. I would recommend you take the free tour when you go to the palace; it gives you a better appreciation of the grounds & monuments.
"We did not find this palace very exceiting after having visited the Forbidden City in Beijing. Its very similar in design. We saw the change of guard ceremony, which was the only interestting thing during our visit."
I loved it such a nice walk around the grounds and see the cherry blossoms around. very nice local history and full of surprising stories
"You can take a subway to this place, or if you stay near Jongno-gu, you can walk. I recommend to visit this place in the morning as there are not many tourirts, and you can experience a peaceful time"
"nicely kept palace. enjoyed taking a leisurely stroll through the palace grounds. although not big, it provides a relatively easy walk for both young and elderly alike."
This is a place I visited for the 2nd time. It is still fascinating to visit this palace again! Those who watch alot of korean drama should at least visit this place for once.
"The palace is well preserved and there are free tours to guide you round. Due to the cold temperatures, we decided to self your to cut the time. I was disappointed that you could not enter any of the buildings however there was information in English almost everywhere. Staff were helpful and polite. There are toilets a a cafe should you need them. We did not enter the second area as you could only do so on a guided tour and this lasted 90 minutes. It was too cold for us to stand around!"
"I came across this palace while trying to locate cheongyecheon. Just a short distance from train station. There is a palace guard changing ceremony here and you can check from the net on the time. We can also try the joseon era clothing here for free and take pictures with the palace guards. But pls, do not intimidate the guards, they are humans too."
"If you have the time, do both the Changdeokgung Palace and Gyeongbokgung Palace. The Changdeokgung Palace showcases palace grounds in harmony with nature, while the Gyeongbokgung showcases the grandeur and of the palace structures and its symmetrical order. Going on the tour of the Piwon Secret Gardens was a highlight, touring through the beautiful landscape around the hilly grounds. It is highly advised to book the 90-minute tour in advance, as each tour only accommodates 50 and is usually sold out, at least for the English and Korean language versions."
"This is a good place to visit specially for people who has interests in local history and culture. I was amazed by how they manage to restore and maintain the facade, color and architectural integrity."
A good morning and some history to mix with everything else but not overwhelmed. Easy to get to though and close to Insadong
"Best of the palaces within Seoul and easily combined with a wander round Bokcheon village. Don't miss the BiWon ""Secret Garden"". It is an extra W3000 but well worth the guided-only tour. Don't wait for a specific language tour since the tour guides are very dry and just spew endless dates and facts, just take the nearest time to your arrival.
I have been more than a dozen times with friends and family and it still impresses"
Charming palace for a quick visit. Worth walking through the contemporary art museum on the grounds.
"I visited Changdeokgung Palace in Dec. and was amazed by the secret garden. Although leaves on the trees are all fallen, the buildings are stills pretty amazing. Tourists are only allowed to go into the garden at certain time with the guided tour. The tour guide was very helpful and really explained the idea behind each building and their layout. Tour is around 1.5hrs and basically hiking up and down the hill, because the garden was built on a small hill.
The guide also recommended us to come back in the autumn. The palace will be much more colorful than it is in the winter."
"Stunning architecture. English tours available at 1030 and 1430 daily. Adjoins the Changgeongung Palace, which requires a separate ticket to be bought. Note that the Secret Garden, which forms 60% of the palace grounds, closes at 3pm, so plan to arrive much earlier to allow plenty of time to explore. Also if you plan to rent an audio-guide, you are required to leave a passport or photo ID."
"Good place to visit to view the old palace from the bygone time. I didn't visit the secret garden, only the palace ground which was not too big."
A beautiful palace in Seoul. It is open all year round for tours. I highly recommend visiting the site in Spring or Summer and taking the Secret Garden guided tour (check times and languages ahead of time!). It was nice in winter but would obviously be orders of magnitude better in summer.
When I went I got to see the changing of the guard ceremony. It was very epic and took about 15-20 mins to complete. Got some cool photos and videos. The guard where traditional ceremonial warrior garb and stand motionless and still out in front of the entrance to the palace. It's pretty cool that they still carry the tradition. The palace is very impressive. It's so big you can barely take a picture of it. Definitely check it out.
"A bit smaller than Gyeongbokgung Palace, but still beautiful and impressive. Less tourists for those who enjoy silence."
We visited Changdeokgung Palace because the other Palace was closed. It was quite a surprise to see the many different buildings and their uses especially the heating system under the flooring. The Secret Garden was the highlight of the garden tour which I would recommend to visitors.
"Our guide was apparently a fan of PSY, which we found to be hilarious. Anyway, the narrow passages of this palace were very interesting to walk through, although the palace itself is not that different from the rest. Huwon (Secret Garden) is probably a lot more beautiful in spring/summer, but it was still nice to walk through.
While the free guided tours are a great way to encourage tourists to learn about Korean history, I do think that the guided tour of the garden is too long. One hour is more than enough to cover this part of the attraction (it takes 90 minutes), especially considering the fact that joining a guided tour is the only way one can see the garden."
"A beautiful palace full of history and stories. We had an english speaking guide who told us the history of the palace and I have a personal guide with me who told me the love story of the king and prince, etc. The palace was partially destroyed but restored later hence some of the heritage is quite modernized. But there more of the palace that are still original and you can still appreciate the beauty of the buliding and the creativity of the craftmens. Somehow it didn't give me the sense of labor intensity when I walked around the palace unlike the Summer Palace in Beijing. I enjoyed walking around the palace...and it's worth the 2-3 hours spend there."
"Rich history & beautiful architectural design! The grounds are very clean, however, I'm concerned the inside of the palace are exposed to the elements."
"I went here with my wife and a 4 years old. We all enjoyed being here. In fact, we think this is more enjoyable than the main palace. The secret garden was very nice even in the winter. It's very peaceful and the tour guide gave us plenty of time to explore and took photos. It was especially nice given there are few people in the group so it was more like a private tour for us. Not sure if that was because we went during winter time (we were there near Christmas). Just make sure to dress warm! We will definitely come again during warmer season"
"So beautiful to see the royal buildings and get to know how it used to be before Japanese invasion for 35yrs which cleansed a lot of their history.
I saw the guard change still done the way used to be. A must ... It's a travel in time"
Don't miss the secret garden. An extra ticket but well worth it. We were there on the peak foliage week and the trees were magnificent.
There are many Palace you can visit when in South Korea and Changdeokgung Palance is just one of them. Nice place to visit and get to know their history.
This was my favorite palace. So beautiful and full of nature! It's a great place for taking photos on a sunny day.
Good experience to see the structure design of the palace. Quite big and therefore have to do a bit of walking.
"Great historical place to go sight seeing, the number of figures on the top of the roof represents the importance of the building."
Secret garden is a must when you visit this palace. The scenery is very beautiful at the secret garden but a lot of walking to do with 1and half hours of guided tours.
This not too well know palace is a germ! Do not forget to visit the lovely gardens in the back! Even better then the Secret Gardens around the corner!
"There are better places in Seoul (like the Buddhist temple in Gangnam). The palace itself looks nice but it's empty and ""new"". If you've been in China and Japan you will find this place worthless."
"This palace is the one I could live in. It has all the elements of other palaces, but if you miss to visit it, you will regret it for sure. It's special because even though it's smaller than Gyeongbokgung, the grandiose first palace, it has such a pleasant peaceful feeling and a secret garden that makes it even more special.
It's definitely worth the entrance fee and the time.
Also, wear comfortable shoes. I wore newly bought ones and ended up walking the whole secret garden tour barefoot.
Don't forget the bottled water either!! It's a life saver.

Advice: buy a ticket for all three palaces at once (10000₩). And do visit all of them. Every palace has it's own charm. You won't regret."
This charming palace is UNESCO heritage sight. Make sure you pay extra for guided tour. This palace is located right next to other attraction such as Hanok village which will only take 15 to 20 min. walk.
spent the afternoon there..had a great tie wandering around and taking pics.. a piece of history in the middle of seoul
"You must come to this place if you're in Seoul. this UNESCO heritage offer a beautiful place. behind this palace,you can see the beautiful secret garden. by adding 6000won,you can go inside and get a tour.
and don't forget also visit the Korean traditional village near this palace,about 15min on walk to Bukchon hanok village."
"Changdeokgung Palace (￦3,000 per adult) is one of the Five Royal Palaces built during the Joseon Dynasty and another important UNESCO World Heritage attraction you can visit in Seoul. Opening hours are 9am until 6 or 6.30pm depending on the season, closed on Mondays.

Note: There is a rear Secret Garden which you can also visit by purchasing the combined ticket (￦10,000 per adult).

Changdeokgung Palace was the primary place of residency for many of the Joseon kings during the 16th and 17th centuries. Here you can find similar buildings, pavilions and landscaping to that Gyeongbukgung Palace. In fact, Changdeokgung is often referred to as East Palace while Gyongbukgung took on the reference of West Palace.

A major difference between the Gyeongbukgung and Changdeokgung palace grounds are that while the former is laid out on centre axis, Changdeokgung is built around the typography of the land, which provides a more natural and harmonious feel to the various buildings and structures you can browse here.

Changdeokgung Palace itself is smaller in scale than Gyeongbukgung and if you don't visit the Secret Garden as well, you can easily and comfortably explore the grounds here in 60-90 minutes. As such, this might be a preferred UNESCO attraction if you are limited in time during visits to Seoul. If time permits, we suggest visiting both the East and West Palaces so you can consider and think about the similarities and differences between them."
Behind this beautiful palace there is a fab park thats great to go around with loads of little buildings to walk around inside. Theres an incredibly small fee to get in and it is very worth going to see.
This is a must-see in Seoul and small enough to squeeze in for an afternoon. We went during a short afternoon sojourn. They close at promptly 5 pm so be sure to be there at least 4pm.
"We visited Changdeokgung Palace on two separate visits while in Seoul recently. During our first visit, we took the guided tour of the ""Secret Garden"". We had made a reservation several days in advance since the English language tour only allows for a certain number of people at a time. Our guide was exceptional. She was very knowledgeable; spoke excellent English; and you could engage her in conversation in between the various stops along the way. This was wonderful as I always want to learn more about the places I visit. I would rate the guided tour we had of the ""Secret Garden"" as the BEST thing we did during our time in Seoul. On our second day, we brought members of our family to the Changdeokgung Palace. We did not take a guided tour. There were signs along the way in English that explained each of the areas of the palace that we saw. They were very well done. Having seen the Gyeongbokgung Palace on a previous visit to Seoul, I would rate the ""Chang"" palace as being more interesting. Why? First, it's in a great setting - on a hillside with woods surrounding it. Second, it is more compact and therefore more manageable to get around to the various buildings. Third, it has the most original buildings of the two palace compounds. That's why it has been chosen as an UNESCO World Heritage site. We really enjoyed walking around Changdeokgung Palace on what was a cold November day. The gift shop was a great place to warm up when we needed to. Consider adding this palace to your list of 'must-sees' in Seoul. You will not be disappointed!"
"This is a smaller palace than Gyeongbokgung Palace. The grounds are full of trees and gardens. It's a very peaceful location with surprises through every door. Like Gyeongbokgung Palace, don't try and do this without a guide. The history is amazing. Unfortunately I didn't have the time (or the energy) to visit the Secret Garden which takes another 1.5 tour. Next time for sure."
Make sure you book tickets for the Secret Garden tour well in advance (at least 2 weeks) - the tour is fantastic and you will not want to miss out. We could have spent hours poking around the grounds. It is beautiful and charming. Easily accessible by transit (Anguk Station is a 5 minute walk from the ticket office). Make time on your trip for Changdeokgung.
"The natural landscape of the Secret Garden was AWWMAZINGGG and beyond words, great place to go when its spring or autumn/winter when the flowers are blooming/falling. This is a guided tour and is an additional purchase of tix apart from the normal entrance fee. Since it is a guided tour, do take note of the schedule of the tour so that you can maximise your time whilst at Changdeokgung Palace!"
"I wish we'd had the time to explore the Secret Garden in addition to the rest of the grounds at Changdeokgung Palace. It was very beautiful. There were several young teens wearing hanbok which was picturesque in this gorgeous setting. We managed to be there at the peak of autumn colors and it was a stunning contrast to the brilliant colors of the buildings. Next time we visit, we will see the Secret Garden too."
this time i went in to themuseum and looked on the history of the dynasti that ruled korea before. made also some nice stamps on postcard so i cand send later to friends
For many time it was reconstructed. They wants people to see the most historical significant attractions of Korea.
"Interesting to see the history of korea and getting to know more of the historical buildings. We were ""running trough"" the area, that is quite big."
"Well that all depends on your level of travel experience. If you are a young traveler (I mean traveled to only a few countries), you will find this Changdeokgung Palace a great place.

However, if you have already been to China and Japan, then you will most likely appreciate the place, without any amazement or excitement.

Nevertheless, it's a clean, spacious and well maintained. Excellent.

Worth a visit, if you like these styles of buildings / palaces."
"One of the great palace in Seoul. However, i think it be really interesting if they open for visitor to walk inside one of the royal house."
"When one enters into this place, you will find not only the palaces but also the park. This is a very good place to explore to have some peace and quiet. It is not as crowded as the Royal palace. Inside too is the secret garden, but you have to pay an extra 5000 KRW inorder to go inside and with the tour. Other than that, the place is beautiful."
Well I am in love with the people of Korea and their behave with the tourists. Actually the guide showed me the old historic ways ..
"This was the most impressive of the palaces I visited.
Located inside a beautiful part - which I highly recommend for a hike or a 40-60 minute walk, it is well maintained, has information in English, and gives an overall feeling for Korean Heritage.
Definitely the one Palace I would not miss."
"We enjoyed the buildings all around Seoul, but what was even better were the grounds of the palace (trees, lakes, etc.) - especially in mid-November as the leaves were all changing to incredible colors of red, yellow, orange. Endless incredible photo opportunities."
"We were just in time for the english tour (1:30PM/schedules are at 11:30, 1:30 and 3:30 PM only). Our tour guide is very fluent in English and has a sense of humor. It made our tour very fun and informative at the same time. She wore her lovely Korean dress, who was very accommodating with everyone's question and kind enough to let everyone take pictures in every part of the Palace. I think why we enjoyed and appreciate the beauty of the Palace is because of the information our tour guide provided unlike if you will be doing the palace tour on your own.

The tour was systematic. Thus, every corner of the Palace was well taught and it's like taking you back to the old times as the tour guide shared to us life of the Royal family. It's not just all glamour.. We had very fantastic experience.

I highly recommend to visit the palace and avail the tour guide for better appreciation of the Palace"
"This is one of the more popular and possibly the largest among the 5 grand palaces of Seoul. The station nearest to it is Anguk which is a short walking distance. We were lucky because the hanok where we stayed is just a stones throw away. If you are a first time visitor, has enough time, and want to see all 5 grand palaces, then I suggest you get the all-inclusive ticket for KRW10,000 (USD8.80). This will save you a few extra bucks instead of paying an entrance fee for each palace. One of its main features is the secret garden which is quite beautiful especially during autumn! My host said it's better during winter but I digress. Tourist guides are a must and schedules are organized depending on which language you prefer. The tour takes about an hour 45 so best to wear your most comfy shoes. If you're lucky enough, try to go with a smaller group as bigger ones tend to be harder to manage plus pictures look best with less crowds."
The Palace is historical and quietly beautiful. The Secret Garden can only be accessed through the guided tours. 1 1/2 hours to cover the grounds. If you don't mind traveling sometimes in a very large group (English tour on a beautiful fall day numbered over 100 people) you'll have a pleasant time.
I walked to Changdeokgung Palace in early afternoon from the Gyeongbokgung Palace and Bukchon Village. The palace is enormous and requires at least a couple of hours of exploration. I suggest that you book a guided tour as the signage and written history is scarce. The Secret Garden is a must!! Absolutely beautiful and a lot less crowded than the palace itself. Be sure to buy your tickets upon entering the palace for access to the garden. A walk through the garden is something I'll never forget. I suggest you take a favourite book and take in some reading in the old outdoor library located there. There are books avail for reading on loan also.
"Went here with my family. It is a very big landscape. You can really explore how Korea was like back then. And dont forget to take pics while exploring, for memories!!!"
"This palace is about 10 minutes walk at max from the Anguk train station.

It started pouring, I mean POURING rain when we got to this palace just before noon but that did not dampen our spirits. The palace is well spaced out (not as spread out as the other palaces in Seoul). It is traditional, historical and peaceful palace. It is very picturesque place though not as grand as Gyeongbukgong, it has its own beauty.

I would highly recommend going for a guided tour first and then take your time to re-visit the areas you liked to take (more or better) photos or just sit there and admire its beauty."
"This palace has the famous secret garden. When I got here, there aren't many people so it was a nice scene.

Like all of the tourist spots in Korea, this lace also lacks English signages, description of the place and decent tourist guides! Entrance fee to this place is 3000 won, and it is no different from palaces you'd find in Beijing. If you'll have to choose which palace to go to, I'd prefer this one over gyeongbokgung palace because you can find here the secret garden and another palace complex as well so it'd be more worth the money."
One of the Korean traditional royal palace located at Seoul City Hall. This palace is so nice. Everyone should come here at least once
"Visited this palace after sightseeing at Insadong. We comfortably walked to the palace from Insadong craft and teahouse district in 15 minutes. We enjoyed the beauty of the palace and it's surrounds. Unfortunately we did not get to enter the secret garden as we arrived 1 hour before closing time, so please ensure if you are wanting to see the place and secret garden you allow yourself at least 3 hours. Enjoy."
"the Secret Garden tour seems really popular, and tickets sell out really fast! we were lucky to get the last 3 tickets for the time slot we wanted.

this 90min tour brings us to the 'secret' back garden which was only accessible by the royal family in the past. there are many similar looking pavilians, almost identical designs and colours, so it is a good idea to have a guide around so she can explain the purpose of each pavilian and its significance to the King back then.

a lot of walking, there are some elderly in my tour group who had to give up half way and sit around while the rest of us continued. slopes and stony tracks too. wear comfortable walking shoes!"
There is time when we can enter secret garden. Tour in in english is available. Beautiful garden behind this palace is beuatiful. I come during Autum.. all red and yellow. We can feel peace and understand why they named it secret garden. Love this place
"This Palace is a replica of the original. I found it quite interesting but wasn't bowled over as the buildings are fairly recent. It does give you a glimpse of what the originals looked like I guess. The gardens cost extra to view, I did not pay."
A must to see and walk through the gardens. The autumn leaves made the palace come to life and history and culture aspects added to the warmth of this place.
"Have been here in April, was amazed by enriched collection of the palace, love how the clothes of imperial family were saved in amazing statement. U should definitely visit this palace."
"This is my favourite palace in Seoul. The secret garden should not be missed, even if you join a tour in another language just to look."
"The secret garden makes up 60% of the palace grounds and is absolutely breath-taking, especially with the autumn foliage. Places were limited to 100 a day (50 online, 50 on the day itself), and I could not book the tickets online even though it was a week away from our planned visit. Instead, we planned to reach the palace at 8.30 a.m. (opening time is 9.00 a.m.) to purchase the tickets. We were lucky we did, as we managed to talk beautiful shots of the palace grounds once the gates were opened, and before the hordes of tourists swarmed in. By 10 a.m. it was difficult to take pictures without tourist photo bombers.

We joined the English guided tour at 10.30 a.m. which lasted for an hour and then the Secret Garden tour at 11.30 a.m. Both tour guides were very knowledgeable and we enjoyed their explanations. However, the secret garden tour was very crowded and there were definitely more than 100 people there. They might have made an exception due to a conference tour group that joined the tour. Also, people were not really interested in the tour guide, instead choosing to wander off and take pictures. Couldn't really blame them when the landscape was so beautiful.

We really enjoyed the 3-4 hours we spent here! Worth a visit! It is located about 10 minutes walk from Anguk station. After the palace, we visited the Hanok Village, Samcheongdil (Korea's café hub) and Insadong for souveniers. Good area to spend a day and tick off Seoul's major attractions."
"The most original of Korea's UNESCO heritage temples, but still 70% was rebuilt after the Japanese destroyed it during its occupation. Everything looks new and all buildings are completely empty.

I had an excellent English-speaking guide, but I would've liked to roam the beautiful ""secret"" garden by myself. Unfortunately that was not allowed.

Only if you've never seen the palaces of Japan and Chine I'd recommend a visit to a Korean palace."
"Changdeokgung Palace is a gorgeous, well preserved, sprawling compound in the middle of beautiful park-like expanse of forest, ponds and structures. You can't tell your are in the middle of Seoul! I was lucky enough to be part of a group that enjoyed some traditional Korean music performance in the Secret Garden. Fantastic experience. But even without the music, this is a must visit."
"Amazing site, beautiful shrines, and breathtaking colours. This is a paid attraction but it's free for South Koreans who dress in traditional clothes. The gardens are a dream"
"The highlight of Changdeokgung Palace is the Huwon/Secret Garden. The ticket to Changdeokgung is KRW3000 and KRW5000 to Secret Garden. Admission to Secret Garden is limited to 50 on-line booking and 50 on-site purchases per session. So queue early if you did not book online in advance. Although the ticket to Secret Garden is with guided tour, you may choose not to join in the tour.

A nice pond and pavilion can be found in the Secret Garden. The beautiful maple trees of different colors can be found around the garden. There were many people visiting the Secret Garden.

The architecture in the palace are great for photo-taking especially in this autumn season. There are Throne & King’s Council Hall, Queen & King’s residences etc in the palace. It helps me understand and appreciate history."
Book your visit to the Secret Garden online well in advance of your trip - limited places in the guided tours in English (as backup solution you could join a Korean guided tour as well - marvelous views don't need explanations).
I visited this palace which was a five minutes walk from my hotel and I loved that it was well preserved and showed the history of Korea. Couldn't get into the museum because it was closed. It was also helpful that most signs were written in both English and Korean
"I enjoyed this palace. Not only are the buildings gorgeous and historical, the forested areas and open space are a welcome change from the city itself. We hopped off here whilst on a city tour hop on-hop off bus. Worth a visit"
"A place for those who love history, and learning about it hands-on, as well as architecture. Good location for photography as well. And if have never seen a persimmon tree with fruit weighing down its branches , this is one of the places for it."
"Just a word of caution: The tour is physically challenging and, at times, arduous (with some steep climbs and descents, frequently on uneven ground and/or stones). Unless you are in good physical and aerobic shape, save yourself 5,000 won and give it a pass.

The guide for my group had full command of English, was cool and laid back, was thorough yet concise and, most importantly, went at a fairly leisurely pace. This allowed people to admire the sights, fall back a bit to photograph along the way and rest a bit, as the tour is physically demanding. [If anyone affiliated with the Imperial Household Agency in Kyoto reads this: You might want to take this tour to see how you should be conducting yours... seriously].

The walk is pleasant, the sights are pleasant. I was a little disappointed that the structural highlight of the tour, Juhamnu Pavilion, was “view at a distance” only. Additionally, I was a little surprised that the structures and grounds of many of the sights were not kept up as one would expect, given the garden’s significance. One of the sights (I believe it was Seonhyangjae) was under complete renovation; while that was bad for us, it will be good for those who visit when it’s completed.

The tour was vastly more valuable from a historical viewpoint than was from a visual standpoint. A Japanese garden it was not. I’m sure in the autumn it will be more visually compelling. This is a subjective opinion but I’m very torn as to whether or not it paid for itself (obviously they have to pay the tour guides which adds to their cost though, so therein lies the bind).

One thing the tour is, though, and that’s shady. If it’s uncomfortably warm or hot, you might want to schedule the tour to coincide with the height of the mid-day sun (although the strenuousness of some of the climbs sort-of negates the inherent temperature differential)."
"Went to 2 palace while in Seoul.
This is my fav of the 2 because of the secret garden.
It's a must go if you are visiting this palace.
Some walking up hill and slope is needed along the secret garden path so proper shoes are needed.
Do note you need advance booking and a seperate ticket to the secret garden which can only be done by tour at specific time.

There are total of 3 tickets needed to access the entire palace which comes in a combination ticket.

Allow 3-4 hours for a slow leisure walk to enjoy this beautiful from the past."
This is my favorite palace in Seoul. Very lovely in autumn. You have to go to the Biwon or Secret Garden tour as well. It's not an easy hike around the garden but totally worth it. Would not tire of going to this again and again!
We visited the palace and the secret garden otherwise also known as Huwon. It was so pretty. We had a lovely time following the guide around and just admiring the scenery. Try to make advance booking online for the secret garden tour as it is often sold out during Autumn.
"Similar to Gyeonbukgong...but this property has The Secret Garden. It has an extra charge for admission. Guided tour is only at certain times(s) of the day. WEAR COMFY SHOES or SNEAKERS. There are MANY places that are uneven, unpaved, MANY STEEP STAIRS with no rails, etc. If you have mobility issues, I would not recommend. Tour is about 1 1/2 hours.

Especially lovely in autumn or spring, when the leaves change or the shrubs/trees/flowers bloom. Very relaxing place."
"Is worth to pay a visit if you love site-seeing.
Secret Garden with good view when maple turn red. You may follow a translate tour if you want to"
"If you have visited the Gyeonbukgong, then this might not seem much different. However, the secret garden (or known as the rear garden) is a must visit. The scenery is nice with lots of trees and plants, the tour also talks about the history of the palace and garden. The secret garden is only open to guided tours, which need to be booked in advance, and the group can get quite big during peak seasons. There are up and down road/stairs and it's a good 90 minute walk."
Not huge but worst to visit. Buildings are nice to take photos. Not too many people are there. Garden/park is nice to walk around.
This is my favorite palace in Seoul. The secret garden is a must. With the fall leaves it is beautiful. You have to take a guided tour but then you can walk on your own during or afterwards.
"I have visited Gyeongbokgung Palace during my first trip to Korea in 2012. I planned to visit Changdeokgung Palace but it suddenly started raining after my visit to Gyeongbokgung. On my second trip to Korea, this was the first palace I visited. Architecture and design-wise, the buildings were very similar to those in Gyeongbokgung. I mean, I didn't really expect them to be different. The layout is what's different and having the Secret Garden is a big plus. I personally did not partake in the Secret Garden tour for friends who have experienced it told me it took so long to finish the course and it can quite tiring. Perhaps, on my next visit I will do so. Nonetheless, this palace is a good place to visit."
"I my opinion Changdeokgung Palace has more charm than the other main palaces in Seoul. If you come here, don't miss the see the amazing Secret Garden just next to the palace. Especially in autumn colors, the garden is an absolutely stunning beaty, that was exclusively used by Joseon dynasty. You can only enter to the Secret garden with guided tour, and definitely worth to pay attention to the stories told by the guide!"
"i am always fascinated of historical places. im like imagining what the people did for living and how they walk and etc during their time in a specific place. in here, you will be able to explore different palaces, and also their quarters- from the king down to servants."
"Nice palace to visit. Loads of walking to do.. Very intricate rooftop designs for the inner palace and the rooms of the king and queen. If I remember correctly. A place that you can take nice photos of Korea.

You could take a walk inside but no need to spend too much time for each visit of the sites."
I went there via the sub way and a nearby museum with free entrance. Historical places nice to visit and took many pictures
"What a gorgeous and amazing palace! It has been rebuilt, but so have many other places that old. We took the advice of a very helpful woman at a tourist information booth in Itaewon, and took the garden tour. Our guide was amazing! Her English was exceptional, and she had a great sense of humor. We learned so much about the garden and its history. I loved the stories, and the beauty of the gardens and building. It was early fall, so the leaves were changing beautifully. What a lovely way to spend time enjoying and learning!"
"Everything has been rebuilt in the last couple decades, but it's quite lovely, and the contrast between this historic center of power and the high-rise centers of power in the background is pretty compelling.
There could be more interpretive signs, and the people in costume are foreigners who rented them for the afternoon, but the guidebook is fine, and the scenery is impressive. Be sure to catch the changing of the guard at the very front gate."
"We watched the changing of the guards, which is every 10am in the morning outside the main entrance. We didn't go inside too far anymore, as seems the palaces are not that grand (I may be wrong) or colourful as compared to other palaces in Asia."
Secret garden is in this palace and guided tour is a must. It's easy to get to. Secret garden is really beautiful. This was one of the highlight of my trip.
"This was my second time touring Changdeokgung palace, my favorite palace in Seoul. While other palaces are larger, I really like the scale and maze-like quality of Changdeokgung. The palace is open to freely explore once you buy your ticket, but if you wish to see the ""secret garden"" you need to go on a tour. Both times I visited was unable to get an English tour as they were full, and had to take the tour in a language I do not speak. The tour is still worth it going on even if your language tour is not available, but to get the full experience book your tour well in advance."
In our option this is the better palace to visit. More to explore and make sure you do the extra garden tour called the secret gardens. This area was used by the Royal family exclusively and is just wonderful. The Japanese used this area as a zoo during their time in Korea.
"Went in autumn, very beautiful garden. We bought combined tickets for palace and gardens. We came on one of the two weeks of the year where you don't need to do the tour to see the garden, you could just buy a ticket and wandering around. This meant that there were people reading and taking photos in the garden. There is a week in autumn and a week in spring. The palace is also pretty and the tour does have some interesting information. The guide we had was reasonably knowledgeble about the construction and original decorative methods when asked."
"Great Landmark , come to take a snap with Changdeokgung Palace. Lots of students and tourists. Nice architect , Korean solider parade , near MMCA museum"
"Seoul has several impressive royal palaces.
They are spread around the city generally on the north side of the river which dissects the city.
Changdeokgung Palace is reasonably small and intimate with a rabbit warren layout of rooms, courtyards and small gardens.
It is one of the ""Five Grand Palaces' built during the Joseon dynasty. While it was originally created as a primary palace in 1395 it was heavily destroyed during the 20th century Japanese occupation and has been rebuilt.
The most famous imperial Secret Garden is quite special and needs a separate ticket to enjoy its flowers and layout.
Well worth a couple of hours walking on a sunny day and remember to take your own water bottle"
easily accessible - main attraction is the changing of the guard - come early as hordes of people line up to see the 'show' ..... smaller complex with lovely gardens and a few buildings...
Went to the palace during the fall season and it's a lovely place to soak up with culture and explore the expansive grounds. Recommended for anyone who are interested in Korean history and culture!
"I was very short on time, but was able to sqeeze in a visit to Changdeokgung Palace in about an hour. The Palace has is beautifully restored, and provides a good insight into what historical Seoul would have been like. It would be great to actually be able to get inside some of the buildings or to have some set up with period furniture to even further fill in the context. Regardless, it's a lovely place to walk around."
"Should have bought all 3 entries. Only bought the main palace n secret garden. The guide tour is very informative and the guide speaks perfect English!
Photo turn out very well.

Must go !"
"Direction: City Hall station (Line 1 exit 2/ Line 2 exit 12)
Ticket: KRW1,000 for Adult
Open: 9am-9pm CLOSED on Monday
Changing Guard Ceremony at 11am/ 2pm/ 3.30pm (infront of Daehanmaun Gate - main gate) no ticket required if you only want to watch the guard changing.
Free guided tour in English/ Chinese/ Korean/ Japanese you need to check the time on their website or counter.
I personally prefer Gyeongbokgung and Changdeokgung, will give this a miss if time is too rush. If you have time suggest you to follow the southern stone wall of Deoksugung is one of the Seoul's most romantic autumn walks."
"Check for the guided tour timings before going, if not you may waste your time. The tour takes one hour. Not the biggest, but nicely preserved complex, linked to a great story, history. Should you wish to visit the secret garden, you have to book in advance, on their website. Also a guided tour, around 100 people, walking up and down in the forest for 90 minutes. A few nice stops, however quite tiring. Avoid going on a rainy day, as it is very slippery."
"This palace is open everyday from 9am to 5/6pm and closed on Mondays. Guided tour of the secret garden was at 11:30pm, 1:30pm, and 2:30pm so be sure to plan your schedule well. The Secret Garden in the back is breath-taking

Korean traditional palace, flowers and trees are very beautiful in autumn.

Historical palace in the historical district within Seoul City

Catch the changing of the guard ceremonies!

Inexpensive admission fee of 3,000 won

World heritage site by UNESCO"
"What impressed us most was the size of the grounds, and number of connected buildings, all of course with interesting traditional design. Very Photogenic; and a nice walk (especially including the Secret Gardens)."
Don't miss the place as it has the Secret Garden which offer the panaromic and eye-catching view of the best garden in Korea
"Gorgeous grounds to visit and stroll around, particularly during the stunning fall. My husband and I strolled around the palace on a Sunday afternoon, and it was full of families and kids enjoying the area. Great place to visit along with Gyeongbokgung Palace-it’s very easy to do both in the same day."
The palance is a nice place to visit but I will not go back for a second time. It is avearge comparing to the real palace I have been. It is sad that all the history was distroy during the war.
"Been here for a day tour while on a business visit.
Very conveniently located in city, 15 min walk from holiday inn.
Weather was very pleasant.
Opens after 9 am, so had to wait to go inside.
Glad to see how they preserve such a ancient monument."
"Here is one of my favourite place in seoul since when I was a very little kid.
I think I was really fascinated by its beauty.
And I recommend you to visit secret garden, I'm sure you can imagine the private life of the Royal family."
"The Palace is very convenient to go. It is well-maintained and nice but when you close up to the building, you'll find that..umm..it is re-painted and quite ""artificial"". The secret garden tour is very crowd, they said 50 persons per tour but seems more than 50 (maybe around 100). However, the garden is worth visiting."
"The Changdeokgung Palace is strategically located close to other museums, it is a must visit if your visit Seoul. And ask to visit the secret gardens. Also try to snap a picture with the palace guards"
"The beauty of this palace lies mostly in its Secret Garden which is only accessible by joining the tour. You can reserve slots for the tour online & just show the confirmation to the staff when buying the tickets at least half an hour before the tour. The tour was informative but I was so captivated by the beauty of the Secret Garden. The palace pales in comparison so please sign up for the tour if possible, at additional 5,000 won, on top of the admission fee of 3,000 won."
"The Changdeokgung Palace is a must see - it is a very large compound so be prepared to walk, and their are no tours and very limited information on each of the different spots within the Palace so you may want to do some reading before hand.

The Secret Garden in the back is breath-taking, but be prepared it is a 1.5 to 2 hour walk which must be with a tour guide. It is a massive compound and lots of up and down hill so make sure you have the right shoes as some paths are not paved.

If you plan to visit the secret garden i suggest going early or on a weekday as the tour i took was very crowded about 100 people with only 1 guide so you won't really hear what he has to say or get any alone time with nature since there are so many people in the group all taking photos."
"Despite of disgraceful name 'Biwon' (which means Secret Palace), this palace had been a important palace in Chosun dynasty in 600 years. Japanese colonial government called it as 'Biwon'.
This palace is the most well preserved one in 5 major palaces. You may not only see history, but also their feelings of old residents.
I recommend guided tour..."
"The timing was hard because we got up early and nothing opens until 9am or later! With Chusok holiday, even more may have been closed. This ""thanksgiving holiday"" is long. In tour books it seems like it's a day and for us it was Sunday but nothing was back open as usual until Wednesday!

We walked to gyeongbokgung palace but it was closed!

The palace doesn't seem as grandiose as the Gyeongbokgung palace but I couldn't believe how much more there was to the grounds. We explored on our first and then waited for an English speaking tour to pass and then hopped on. We had to pass time before our secret garden tour. I ""reserved"" online weeks before but it didn't seem to matter when we got to the ticket booth. They say that half of the tickets are reserved and the other half is on the day of. 11yo lasted through 2/3 of it but it was still worth it. The English speaking tours are later in the morning so we seemed to be waiting around. We should have prepared better and done bukchon village which is close or jongmyo shrine which is also close."
"Visited here as part of a multi palace wander of Seoul. This beautiful and serene spot contains ancient Korean palace architecture, well manicured grounds, aquaducts, and much more. You can see the place in under an hour if you hustle, but I would suggest spending a few hours to take in the many great views. This is a coll piece of Korean history and culture which must have been truly spectaculat in the day"
"Tour times are available when you purchase your ticket at the entry, this is the only way to enter the Secret Garden which was slightly more than a stroll in a garden, there was some up and down hill so wear appropriate footwear."
"Another attractive Palace, lots with the history and great opportunity for photography. All these are near by you can pay a small visit to cover them all!"
"The palace complex consists of several buildings, each with its own unique story and design. It is well worth a wander around and if you time your visit right and take a tour then the history is intriguing but good signposting in English and Korean mean you can learn something about the place guided or not. Each of the palaces of Seoul has its own character and this one for me is the most interesting. A great place to spend an hour wandering around."
Take a beautiful step back in time by visiting this historical treasure. I highly suggest a docent led tour to best learn about the lives of the Korean royals
"This palace has a slightly pricey 3,000 Won entrance fee, but it is worth it considering the historical journey one experience as I move from one courtyard to another."
It is very near to Gyeongbokgung. Visit the Secret Garden. It takes 2 hours. The tour guide will tell you stories about building in it.
"Cheap entrance fee. Without the assistance of a tour guide or previous knowledge, most of the palace buildings and their purposes etc were just interesting things to look at. Pretty, though. We visited on a public holiday during the week and it was pretty busy."
"We actually did not go inside because so busy with school kids but outside view was great anyway , just the building design was outstanding , and great history"
"Didn't get to see much of the palace because of the Secret Garden tour, but beautiful grounds. Had an English-speaking guide who expalined a lot of the symbolism of the various places where we stopped. A lovely tour."
"As one of the 5 palaces from the Joseon Dynasty, this palace is a beautiful landmark. There are tours available in English, Korean, Japanese, and Chinese."
"I believe that Changdeokgung is the most beautiful of all the palaces grounds in Seoul, and the secret garden within the palace walls is also well worth a visit. Making an online ticket reservation for one of four guided English tours per day is very easy and will ensure you entrance to the garden, which is only allowed with a guided tour. Best time to visit is spring or fall, as with all of Korea. Very close to other cultural attractions including Bukcon and Insa-dong."
"Changdeokgung Place secret garden tour is lovely to do on a hot day, tour moves quickly only a brief photo opportunity in each area, but suitable for all ages of reasonable walking fitness. Cost is 3,000 won each approx $3.60 Australian dollar. History is interesting but book early for english speaking tours ( can do on line) as they fill up quickly. The garden and buildings can only be viewed through an organized tour, you cannot go in on your own."
"This is one of five places in Seoul but this palace has a special secondary attraction called the Secret Garden. Admission This palace is open everyday from 9am to 5/6pm and closed on Mondays. I came here in November and the english guided tour of the secret garden was at 11:30pm, 1:30pm, and 2:30pm so be sure to plan your schedule ahead of time. The tickets for this palace runs out quick so make sure you come early in the morning to pick up tickets for your preferred time slot."
It's one of the most amazing things that I saw in Korea. Every time I will come here i will go to visit it
"Gyeonbokgung palace is quite beautiful, and even more than that, it spreads on a huge area and contains a lot of ""rooms"" as part of the palace. It's got a nice history behind, which makes it much more interesting, so try to get some info when you're heading there."
"I recommend doing the guided tour (the palace and secret garden) instead of just wandering around the palace by yourself to know more about the history and fun facts. Unless you only want to take pictures.

It's amazing how this big of an area (+ the secret garden) are located IN a city like Seoul."
"Interesting historical place to visit in Seoul, keep in mind that gided tour is quite long - about 2.5 h if you plan to visit the secret garden as well."
"Let me start by advising that the ""pay extra and have the ability to tour independently on Thursdays"" that you may find in the latest editions of guidebooks is dated and incorrect. They discontinued that some time back. You may still tour the grounds of the Palace without a guide but the Secret Garden is by 1 1/2 hr guided tour only.

To fully absorb the entire complex (ie Changdeokgung, the Secret Garden, Changgyeonggung and Jongmyo) properly allow a full sightseeing day, unless you visit during the summer when it will stay light until evening.

Although they are usually lumped together, since they require separate entrance fees, I will address them separately. This is solely for Changdeokgung.

Like its competitor to the west, this palace is on a huge, sprawling piece of land. Architecturally, it best reflects the Joseon Dynasty's sensibilities. It is set amid, not on top of, its surroundings and landscaping. It does not seek to overwhelm (as does Gyeongbokgung) but rather to consistently impress and inspire awe. Take the 1 hour guided tour if you'd like, but then return, history in hand, and wander through its labyrinthine design.

As you move from west to east (assuming you use the entrance off of Yulongno, passing through Donghwamun Gate), you will eventually come upon the King and Queen’s private quarters. Finally, there is the residence of the Crown Prince (farthest to the east as he is a symbol of the rising sun).

The structures and grounds are very well maintained and there is a café across the way where you can cool off and relax before taking the Secret Garden tour next door. You might want to get the garden tour times in advance and time your visit to the palace accordingly.

Keep in mind that if you continue on to Changgyeonggung, when the grounds close, the path back to Changdeokgung closes and your only way out will be the gate to the extreme east... which is, logistically, in the middle of nowhere."
"Changdeokgung — also known as Changdeokgung Palace or Changdeok Palace — is set within a large park in Jongno-gu, Seoul, South Korea. It is one of the ""Five Grand Palaces"" built by the kings of the Joseon Dynasty"
Another incredible palace in Seoul and also very very big. You will get a feel of different gardens and what the palace offered back then. I enjoyed my visit here and within the palace you will also find different sections where the locals back then used to practice their religion along with little villages.
"The palace to be honest is quite ordinary...just bare big halls really...in my opinion, just pick 1 of the 3 palaces and skip the rest...I would ideally skip this one but the secret garden is worth visiting...u can only visit the secret garden in guided tours,so check up schedules ahead and get there ahead of time..the tour places are limited ...in tyhe secret garden tour involves a lot of walking, climbing some steep hills...so be warned, don't do this if you are not fully fit or if the weather is too hot"
"The palace is old and seeped in history. There are english guided tours that lasts an hour. They take you through some of the important aspects of the history. So well worth that. It is very well maintained and even the restroom facilities are quite zen like. So, do visit. When you buy tickets for the palace, do buy the tickets for the Secret Garden tour as well. The English tour of the palace ends 10 minutes before the guided Secret Garden tour. Only 100 tickets are available to the secret garden per tour. It can be crowded, but you can enjoy the flora. There are some very old trees, including a 750 year old one."
"Nothing special about the palace grounds, but they are beautiful and we purchased a combo ticket that included four palaces so we went and were glad we did."
"Brimming with people during Chuseok 2015 , but totally a good walk through history. Finally , was able to get into the Huwon Secret garden. Nice trek around the garden despite the humidity. A must visit in Seoul."
"This was part of our whirlwind self guided tour of Seoul on an all day layover. Within walking distance of the main train station (a very long walk though), temple grounds are compact and beautiful. My only complaint would be that the secret gardens are by tour only and if you're on a tight schedule, you will miss the opportunity. We were there on Monday so the other temples were closed. But this one is beautiful and gives you a good dose of history and culture."
We visited on 8 September and had a wonderful guide who took her time to explain the history of the palace and the various places of interest in the secret garden. The history of Korea is quite interesting if one cares to listen carefully. We had plenty rest stops an the guide was open to any additional questions. It was definitely worth every Korean Won spent for the 90 minute tour. Highly recommended.
"I went to The Secret Garden at this Palace, which needs a different ticket. You do have to go in a group. It was lovely and the guide was informative. It is a very large area, a lot bigger than I thought. You may be lucky to see squirrels eating the acorns."
"This ""back-up"" palace was the primary royal residence for a long period. The grounds and buildings are well-preserved and very interesting. We took the English-speaking tour that seemed a little rushed. Worth the time to linger. Also, recommend the tour of the ""secret garden"" behind the palace."
"I am a history major, and I usually love these historical attractions, but I couldn't have been less interested with this palace. Maybe, its because I live in China and have seen structures like this before that I just really thought this attraction was not that interesting.

It wasn't really that old, as many buildings were rebuilt many times. The buildings had nothing inside, so they seemed just like empty shells. Much of the ground was just gravel, thus lifeless. Finally, there were only general descriptions of a couple areas, not descriptions for each building. Basically, there was no narrative to the entire place. If compared to similar buildings in China, there is no comparison. Even though the buildings in China are usually tourist traps, they tell you a story. For me that is important

One thing I can say about the place is that it is really cheap. My wife and I paid 6,000 won to get into both of the eastern palaces. That's basically six US dollars.

It is good to see the history of Korea in the Joseon palaces, but don't waste more than a morning on them."
"Changdeokgung Palace is VERY worth and MUST to visit. It was built in 1405, one of 5 remaining Joseon-era palaces, became a UNESCO World Heritage Site list in 1997. Korea’s last emperor Sunjong passed away on these grounds in 1926. Don't miss the Secret Garden!
Good to have a tour guide if you want to know more about the history of Korea and want to catch a glimpse of how the emperors live their daily lives. Luckily, we have a local Korean tour guide in our 7-day group tour, whom even tell us more about how the Korean and the palaces have been affected during the era of Japanese rule of Korea ."
"The palace in itself is very nice. The garden are said to be the best part of the visit. But beware, you need to pay an extra fee to visit the garden. Moreover, it comes with a guided tour. The ones in English are not frequent and departs at specific times. Last one at 4 pm if I remember well."
When I went there I was so lucky because it was nearly empty because I visited like one hour before it's closure but still had time to take a lot of photos and visit all. It closes at around 5pm i think so go there at 3:30 so it won't be crowded!
"Have to admit we skipped the palace and went straight for the secret garden. Something I definitely don't regret. Go there!

The garden is a magnificent oasis in this intense city. Our guide introduced us both to the garden itself, the many buildings in there as well as their function and role in the history.

This garden tour is one of the most memorable things done during my Seoul visits."
"It is best to start your tour of the palaces with this one right here. Crowds are few and tour groups, which are both free and in English, are much smaller. The other palaces you can make do without a tour if you have a guide book, you'll notice lots being repeated in terms of the design of the palaces and structure.

This palace also has a secret garden out back which makes for a pleasant stroll. Note that you are not allowed to wander around the garden by yourself but must go with a tour, you are however allowed to amble around the rest of the palace freely.

It takes a good half day to see everything if you're with a tour. Lots of pagodas, ponds and architecture that must be quite stunning in the fall."
"The Changdeokgung Palace, another Seoul’s national pride that made it to the UNESCO World Heritage Sites list in 1997. Literally means “Palace of Illustrious Virtue”, Changdeokgung Palace was built in 1405 when the then Joseon King Taejong thought that the existing Gyeongbokgung Palace is inauspicious. As most palaces in Seoul, Changdeokgung Palace is a reconstruction (1610) after it was destroyed by fire during the Japanese invasion.
Also known as the Second Palace, Changdeokgung boasts 13 buildings on its palace grounds and 28 pavilions in its gardens.
The main throne hall of Changdeokgung Palace, was used for conducting major state affairs including the coronation of a new king, assembly of officials, and reception of foreign envoys."
"If you want to know more about the history of Korea and want to catch a glimpse of how the emperors live their daily lives, this is the place to be.
Be sure to bring a decent camera to take photos of the place.
Got to witness the guards changing parade while leaving, reminiscence of London guard changing parade."
It's like stepping back in time. Make sure you catch the changing of the guard at the front gate to the palace.
"It's a must see in Seoul. However if you come straight after a couple of weeks in Japan (as we did) you cannot help comparing Korean and Japanese temples/shrines and I think Korean ones could have been much improved with a bit of painting, landscape design etc"
"This is one of the places I enjoyed in Seoul, despite the large crowds which does detract somewhat. Prepare for a lot of walking. Take the guided tour. 3 hours for a quick visit, but longer time needed to savor the atmosphere (in between large tour groups)"
"My favorite part about this palace was the Secret Garden, everything was so beautiful, so many beautiful things awaited us on this beautiful tour of the Royal Family's Secret Garden. i honestly thought the name was a play on the Drama but don't be fooled. the entire Palace is beautiful but the Secret garden is just the icing upon the cake. it you buy the combination ticket of the four palaces for 10,000 won, the Secret Garden tour is free."
"Visited this site during Chuseok (Korean thanksgiving day), hence admission was free.

The architecture of the palaces here are amazing. Can just imagine how magnificient this place is in the place.

As this is a huge complex, you need to walk alot. Wear in comfortable shoes.

A great place for phototaking and spending half a day here just soaking in the atmosephere and culture."
We visited this palace on one day and the other palace another day to avoid palace overload and it was a great plan. Wonderful place to meander and see the way life was lived. Also there were plenty of English signs so we got a lot out of it. We booked the secret garden tour but it moved so slow and had 40-50 people so we only stayed on that tour for 45 minutes. It is ashame they won't let you walk around on your own. Still worth a visit.
"We briefly pass through the palace grounds because our main attraction of the day was the secret garden, Huwon, behind the palace. It's really a beautiful place with lots of greenery but the steep slopes may prove to be challenging for some. Be prepared to walk ALOT uphill and downhill in the garden but it will be worth the effort."
A well kept UNESCO site in the heart of the city. Not too disimmilar to others that can be found across Asia but still worth a visit with a guide so that you can gain an insight into the history. The secret garden is well worth seeing - it's an additonal cost and you must have a guide to escort you around. I walked through the gate of youth and haven't aged a day since!
My husband and I booked the English speaking tour. It lasts about an hour and is worth it. The buildings are beautifully preserved and maintained. A must see!
"Uniquely built to harmonize with nature, buildings were creatively architecture, built without disrupting the order of its environment. Demonstrated the wisdom of the master builder and great craftsmanship of early Korean dynasties. Truly Korean contribution as UNESCO World Heritage."
"Went here to see the palace and while it felt a little ""barren"" the architecture was why I enjoyed it. I am a fan of building architecture and yes, some of the building had been burned down and rebuilt, but I wanted to learn about the history of the palace and the signs scattered about allowed me to at least understand a bit about that.

We got the package that allowed us to visit all of the UNESCO sites and, apparently, they throw in the tour of the ""secret"" garden which, well, isn't actually too much of a secret. They also call it the ""rear"" garden which is a much more fitting name. its a large area with some natural pools and very quiet areas. After the first three stopping points it gets a bit hilly so those who are not as ambulatory or are in a wheelchair/use a cane/have problems walking easily on incline surfaces should probably skip the last two stops.

Overall it was a nice place to visit and see the grounds and palace. It is also nearby to Insadong, which is a shopping district (mainly souvenirs) but we strolled there as well afterwards and it was a nice relaxing place to visit.

Overall I'd say at least check it out if you are a fan of history, architecture or both."
This is a must see if you are in Seoul. The grounds and buildings are beautiful. It is a very peaceful place to walk and enjoy the scenery
"One of South Korea's most popular tourist attractions. At the entrance there is a Changing of the Guard, somewhat of a Korean variant on Buckingham Palace, with traditional costumes and music. I believe this place can be crowded at times, but Friday noon it was ok. The park is large with another large garden, the further you will walk into the park, the more quiet it becomes. And that is the moment where you really get to enjoy it. Peaceful relaxation and stunning views into the mountains. I am normally not much of an historician but would like to come back here one day just early in the morning or late in the evening."
"In this place, you can really sense the history of Korea. There are many old rooms and a big area to walk. You can see ponds and nature, along with the palaces of course. I recommend entering ""the secret garden"" where you can explore much more. Ps: the only way to enter the secret garden is by having a tour ( English or Korean ), unlike most other parts of the place that can be entered with no tour."
"Architecturally interesting to see, but not much of the interiors are available to see. It's definitely worth seeing however."
"Entrance fee to this palace is super cheap, like 2500W or something. It's beautiful, particularly in the fall with all the foliage, or in the spring with the cherry blossoms. It's a nice piece of culture nestled in a good area of the city. Definitely stop by."
We went by ourselves and it was great to see the greenery the little lake and the changing of the guards . We sat under the pagoda and just sat in peace under the shade from the humid weather . There was a entrance fee which wasn't much but so worth while to see . Would of been better with a English speaking guide to tell you the history of the place but we saw it on our travels and just went in
"Large complex of palace buildings. Nice place to wander around and visit. Grounds are large quiet compared to the city. Unfortunately most building are ""recreations"" and not authentic. The buildings are have the same look and feel, so once you see this many of the other palace sites seem to be the same."
It's a great idea to see this and the other one in the same day. They're pretty close to each other. It's definitely worth the time to see this one as well. It's beautiful and has this cool inner beauty about it. It doesn't look as nice and worth it until you get into the heart of it. Very worth and beautiful!
"We were pleasant surprised by the beauty of this palace, which is set in lovely gardens.
This palace is initially built to house the ladies of the palace,the ladies in waiting etc.ut had lovely corridors leading from one section to another. The scenic and tranquil garden designs made me think how pleasant it must have been for the inhabitants to live here. We were fortunate enough to witness a bridal photo-shoot while we were there, and asked to have a couple of shots to be taken with the bride in her gorgeous Korean bridal gown. She obliged! Another bit of trivial information......we have been told that if we garb ourselves in the Korean traditional outfit while entering any of These palaces, the entrance would be free!"
Much much smaller than chines palace but u should know the knowledge that what a tragic history this palace have.
Another must see although smaller than Kyungbuk palace it's worth a visit and you could also visit Insadong as both palaces and Insadong are fairly closely located. It would be a good one day tour.
Preferred this to Gyeongbokgung actually as it was less crowded. Secret Garden tour was very nice but be warned there is some climbing. A lot to see so easy so spend most of a day here.
"majestic and magnificent. Although its touted as a ""backup"" palace to Gyeongbokgung, the interior is actually more complete. As such, you will be able to have a better understanding of how life in the palace is like. Of cos, having a secret garden tour adds to mystic of the place.

Tip: take the complimentary tour of palace if you have an hour to spare. (together with the 90mins secret garden tour, you will need about 3hrs here) The guides are very professional and communicate very well in english. The insights offered by them will definitely make your visit more memorable."
Every weekend I walk by this palace and gate. And each time it is wonderful. And make sure you take in the grounds inside and out. Bukchon is just around the corner and should not be missed.
This palace is not very different from those you can see in the eastern countries. In fact is not as spectacular like those you see in China
This was smaller than Gyeongbukgong but still beautiful and maintained its majestic facade. One bonus was the little craft and coffee shop inside; however the souvenirs were so expensive!
The Secret Garden tour is really nice but be ready to go (a steep) uphill more than once. You don't feel like you're in the city because it's full of green and it looks hidden.
"Not as grand as Gyeongbok Palace, but the Secret Garden is well worth the visit. Facilities are limited so suggest visiting before or after lunch as no food is available, only limited drinks. A visit to the Secret Garden is only available by taking the guided tours,"
"I have spent 8 days in Seoul in September, and the Changdeokgung Palace was of my personal Highlights. Im into history and culture, so I visited 4 of the Palaces and Changdeokgung was my favourite. Yes, Gyeongbokgung is more impressive, but Changeokgung for me has more atmosphere. I visited on a hot sunny day, and in some parts of the Palace I was alone. It was great just to sit in the shade and enjoy the surroundings. I joined one of the guided tours to the Secret Garden and also quite enjoyed that. Its not really a Garden, but a Forest with some Pavillions, which could be a dissapointement if you are expecting a Garden like in the Forbidden City in Beijing. I really enjoyed the tour and the guide (sorry, cant remember her name) was lovely and gave a lot of information. The only (major) downside: the group was very big (100 people), which doesnt make for a relaxed stroll around a beautiful piece of nature."
"Exciting place. Glorious in its simplicity. Huge gardens, buildings in very good condition.
A must while in Seoul."
The place is huge and the palace is nice. Learned more about the colorful history of the Korean Kings and how they lived during those days.
"If you have more than a day in Seoul you're gonna visit Gyeongbokgung, but nearby many people miss out on this palace. I would say this is better in some ways, especially in hotter months like July and August. This is because its nice and green, more shaded and quite different in layout from the other palaces."
"This palace is neat, you can take a look around yourself but it will be very plain. Take guide suitable with your language. Our guide speaks excellent English and explains clearly. Overall, the palace is quite so so.

The highlight is the Secret Garden. You are obliged to be with tour guide inside the garden. It is very very spacious and tranquil, it doesn't feel like you are in the center of a crowded city. I went in summer and everything is green and beautiful. They say that autumn is the best time to visit since it will be more colorful.

Bring your own umbrella maybe, because we got hindered for a while by the rain. The entrance fee is around krw 8000, I don't remember exactly since I bought the package for 4 palaces for krw 10.000. There is a souvenir shop + coffee shop near the entrance."
Make sure you prebook the secret garden guided tours before your trip as the English groups get sold out pretty early. The garden is a restricted area and also pretty big so having a guide is a must. Explore the scenes and prepare yourself with the right costumes as there are quite a lot of up and down walking.
Another cheap visit although once again all the buildings were either empty of you were not allowed in. Secret garden tour (extra charge) was worth the money but be prepared for a large tour group (50+) which does rather spoill the tranquil setting.
"My favorite of the palaces. Quieter than Gyeongbokgung and very beautiful. The Secret Gardent costs extra and you need to do a tour, so be sure to plan in advance."
"There are three door open. The left door means the past, the middle door means present and the right door means future so it is important to listen to Korean history. Everyone needs to walk through the middle door and came out in the right door."
"The palace is magnificent and one of the best preserved of all the Joeson era palaces. It has the only remaining example of the blue tiled roofs that adorned the palaces still remaining within its walls.

Recommend that non Korean speakers get the audio tour guides, these are very helpful in explaining the different buildings and their functions.

Do not miss the tour of The Secret Garden! Beautiful and insightful into the lives of the Joeson Kings. A word of warning though, the secret garden is not an easy stroll across manicured lawns, and while those with average levels of health will find it easy enough... If you struggle with mobility in any way or are in poor health some of the inclines will make this garden extremely difficult if not impossible for you."
Not much to do here. Can walk the grounds in about half an hour and you can't actually enter the buildings. We did a guided garden tour. Took over an hour and wasn't that informative.
"I finally made it here in the afternoon. The temple itself is ok but the option to tour the secret garden makes it awsomeness. The garden is heavily shaded and enclosed in nature. Be aware that like with most tours, they kinda make stuff up to fill in the gaps."
"interesting palace, cheap entrance fee, interesting ceremony during guards change, worth the visit if you are visiting Seoul"
"Great place to see live shows, and see a imperial palace. Its really not hard to find, it pretty much near the art district. It should be free if you want to visit the bare perimeter, but if you are thirsty for more info there is a charge."
"I was there years before in winter.
Cold but the view is good.
You can see a lot of historical building there."
"A huge palace with more than 30 buildings that in it's hey day had 300 buildings. Well worth spending a few hours walking around! The beautiful ceilings of the gates and buildings still retain their vibrancy. Little figures on the roofs show how important it is, the more figures the more important. Did love the sign warning of wild animals! They mean squirrels. Enjoyable look into Korea's history."
Great palace to visit -- Would have liked more detail in English or English speaking tour guide to get full effect of site -- Enjoyed Palace and area
"We went on what was National children's day. It was very crowded and that made it difficult to see most of the exhibit. We did see them practicing for a parade of soldiers, but our guide was not very good at expalining it. The main part of the palace was colorful and the architectural details impeccable. It had been rebuilt after a fire. I actually do not remember much but the crowds."
He most beautiful palace and very close to our hotel. We spent many hours wandering through the grounds.
"A must see, especially on a Friday or early in the morning. Pick a quiet day, but note that the palace is closed on Mondays.

Most tourists rate this a close second to Gyeongbokgung, but both palaces are World class attractions. Think of Changdeokgung as a younger sister - with more elegance, beauty and quiet charm.

The inner palace tour is known as the Secret Garden tour at the ticket office. I wish I had taken this tour, as it covers more than half of the grounds, including a lake and pagodas. The ticket prices are not easy to read, as there are several categories. Thankfully the staff are very helpful."
A relatively large palace with nice scenery for photo-taking. Entry fee is required and another entry fee to the inner palace which is worth visiting.
"You should opt for the inner palace tour - It is very serene and pleasant. The Guide were knowledgeable and caring throughout the journey. ""Thumbs Up!"""
I loved seeing this site it was quiet a majestic site to see of the buildings and its ornate beauty within the palace.
"A must visit when in Seoul
Allow plenty time to visit this huge immaculate palace & grounds. Great value"
"We primarily spent time in the secret gardens, which were definitely worth a visit. You can only see them with a guided tour, which are offered a couple times of day in English, as well as Korean and Chinese, and very cheap. We spent some time walking around the palace, which is absolutely breathtaking! The whole complex is peaceful. Definitely worth a visit!"
"In my opinion, Deoksugung is the best, and Cahgdeokgung is the second. It has beautiful architecture style, and well preserved."
"I find the Changdeokgung Palace complex much more beautiful than Gyeongbokgung Palace, as the former has a lot of beautiful trees and ponds, and different types of buildings, giving visitors a sense of a living space. Gyeongbokgung Palace has just buildings."
"The palace is a post WWII reproduction of ancient palaces largely destroyed during Japanese occupations of Korea 400 years ago and between 1910 and 1945. The tours of the palace and secret gardens are disappointing. The gardens are little more than a forest these days and several ponds, coppolas and out buildings are interesting but not impressive."
"If you are only in Seoul a few days, it probably isn't necessary to hit all of the palaces. The architecture of the Chosun period is quite uniform, and there are plenty of other sites you can visit that will offer you some variety. This was my favorite of the ones I visited, however. It is huge and expansive and has some of the most photogenic corners. I went in the morning, when it wasn't so hot and I practically had the place to myself."
"It is worth doing a guided tour. They are included in admission price, and you get much more out of it"
"Mostly reconstructed buildings that make for a beautiful ancient complex in the hard of Seoul, we took great photos and moved on"
"We visited 3 of the city's palaces throughout our trip. All in all, this one was our favourite. It was so peaceful and large that I felt like I stepped back in time. Even though there were a couple of busloads of schoolkids there, the palace never felt crowded. There are plenty of small areas you can walk through, besides the main attractions and i would highly recommend doing that."
"We visited this palace the day the Gyeongbokgung Palace was closed. One of us has already visited Deoksugung Palace during a previous 3-day trip. One palace will probably be enough to visit...and my guess that would be Gyeongbokgung. But here, we really enjoyed the Gwolnaegaksa section of this palace (straight ahead from the entrance) where buildings are closer together. For the rest of the grounds, in the summer, be ready and have something against the sun (during the summer months) as there are not a lot trees between buildings. We'll go back when the entrance to the Secret Garden is free."
If you want to learn about Korean culture and history check out this place it's where the Royals is to live and it's over 500 years old and new great condition: ☺ in addition to great location to city hall there is also really good Korean food nearby and it's peaceful cuz its away from the noisiness of the traffic
"This is my personal favorite of the 5 palace complexes open to visitors in Seoul. Why? 1. Many of the rooms still have their original furnishings, which the other palaces lack. 2. There's the rear garden, which is larger than that of any other palace. 3. Parts of Changdeokgung were still inhabited by members of the former royal family up to 1989, which lends it a certain authenticity that some of the long-abandoned, re-constructed palaces lack."
This beautiful and colorful palace in central Seoul is one of the major palaces of the Joseon dynasty. Very pretty and worth a visit.
"One more very significative site in Seoul, we visited, was the Changdeokgung Palace.
It counts as one of the Five Grand Palaces built by the kings of the Joseon Dynasty. Since it was near to our Hotel Biwon in Yulgok ro, we profited the chance to see it, but only after we saw the Gyeongbokgung Palace, located something to the west.
The thing we were enchanted with, was the fact of an ideal blend of the existing buildings of this Palace with surrounding nature and its topography.
It is presently on the list of UNESCO World Heritage Sites.
This Palace was established as the second one by the importance, after the Gyeongbokgung Palace. But while the buildings of the later are arranged in accurate architectural principle, the edifices of the Changdeokgung Palace are disposed more freely.
There are the two main entrances, that should be paid, that is, for the Palace itself and Palace Garden, but both very worth of that.
Again as in the case of the Palace to the west, the characteristic korean or asian generally architecture, with the wooden construction(slabs,beams, pillons, curved eaves in its ends, the roofs made of grey tiles etc.)
That was the last wonderful place in Seoul, we had seen that 2008 year, before we continued further on our way to Japan."
Changdeokgung Palace and Huwon Garden (Secret garden) are beautiful places. Golden leaf and red leaf are amazing. October is the suitable for viewing autumn leaf.
"I only visited the Secret garden, it needs reservation so I did it in my home country. Paid 5000 KW. A guided tour will be provided. Took 1 hr 15 minutes. It's claimed to be one of the palace that was most often visited by the emperor due to its beauty. It's a nice, serene place surrounded by greenery, blossoming flowers. Ancient pavilions with chinese poem on it could be found. But it's not too much of a surprise to us. Perhaps we were already awestruck by Gyeongbokgung palace a day earlier =)"
"Since we are staying in a guesthouse near the palace we went there early as it is very humid that day.
The Guided tour in English started at 10:00hrs but we were there by 9:00hrs and we already look around and took photos.
This is recommended if you like to focus on the interesting history talks of the tour guide wearing Traditional Korean Hanbok while showing you around the palace.
It will take an hour till your next tour to the Secret Garden.
That's why you don't have time to take much photos because there's a lot of places you will be visiting with the group (in fast pace) then next going uphill to the garden.
You must wear running shoes, enough sunblock, insect repellent, water and eye shades as you are going to do some hiking. We visited the area during summer (June 2015).
The tour in the secret garden and the admission fee are separate purchase at the ticket booth. But since you are already there, you might be up to doing some adventure while discovering the King's hide out when he needs to be alone and relax.
Definitely a must visit!"
"Changdeokgung Palace was close to our hotel. The entrance cost 3000 KW for Palace itself and Palace Garden had a separate price. If you have been to China and other Asia you would be probably disappointed, so was I. The Palace looks like Chinese but cheap, it is small and low like few other things in Korea. Blooming trees were really beautiful over there. But in general it was not a Palace but traditional mansion."
"I was told thi was were the Secret Garden series was shot, but i didnt go to the garden due to a busy line. Nevertheless, the palace is already worth the visit. So amazed to see how koreans have a rich sense of culture and history and their love to preserve monuments such as this."
"This was one of the stops on a tour I booked through the hotel; as part of a larger, ""Korean Cultural Insight"" tour. I wasn't sure what to expect, however I was pleasantly surprised by this impressive restoration. The tour guide was certified and gave a good background on the history and culture of the palace. The only advice I can offer is to bring an umbrella, as I did get caught in some rain on the tour, which was largely outside."
As the title says; interesting buildings but the surroundings don't match. If this is your first tour in Asia it will be OK. If you're visiting this after going to a Japanese garden or castle ... meh.
Went to see the main palaces within a 7 mile perimeter on a hot day. Wonderful to see alone but better when with a tour or read up on the structures beforehand. With two youngsters that wasn't the case this time. But still it's wonderful to see and experience the tradition and serenity in such a busy city.
"You come and pay for the entrance (very cheap) and get a free tour with it.
Definitely take the tour, you'll learn lot's of fun facts and will have a great time!"
Another ok imperial palace. This is probably slightly more interesting than the Gyeongbokgung because of the gardens.
Be prepared for a ton of walking and wear very comfortable shoes. Grounds are beautiful with awesome secret garden. Tour guide also explains the historical aspect of each building or landmark.
Amazing architecture and gardens! Great place to get an insight of Korean history! A nice change of scenery from the hustle!
"We did the palace entry and Secret Garden combo (you can't go through the Secret Garden on your own... you NEED to be escorted on a tour. Check the times!).
The garden was fantastic, and the tour guide kept it interesting (got some great pictures).
The architecture through the palace and such was stunning as well... great history in Korea, and this place gives a good idea into some of it."
"This is definitely one of the most beautiful places in Seoul. The carefully curved and colorfully decorated buildings look really marvelous. When walking along I had a chance to admire the old builders' effort. That gave me the chance to imagine how much the Koreans respected the emperor's authority.
The buildings are perfectly set inside the peaceful park. This is very Asian style which philosophy is to cooperate not interfere with nature. Walking along the gardens was a very relaxing experience for me after the hustle and bustle of contemporary Seoul.
To sum up this place is one of Your must see list when in Korea."
We visited this palace during our stsy. it gives an insight into korean architecture. nice place to learn about korean culture.
"It's an absolute must-visit. More like five gardens, it is a forest oasis that allows you to completely forget you're in a major city (unlike many other gardens where skyscrapers peak through). The cleverness of the design, from re-creations of ""the world"" to a Korean pond to marvels of in-floor engineering, is just impressive. Our guide was very friendly. Do remember to make advanced reservations (our hotel helped). There is the surrounding palace which was nice and all, but it's the garden that is the real destination."
"The palace has various section and large area, imagine once you seen Korean traditional movie each scene will recall the moment here. If you visit with local guide, you will know and understand of each meaning hiding of each design, art and would answer you why! Is a good book to read in real place."
"Go with confortable shoes, back pack and bottle of water, because inside have a huge garden with interesting stories. The guide is not friendly, never smile, but any way is place that you must have to go. In the begning have a toilet so if wanted just go, because the next toilet is in the end of the trip. I think it took's 1 hour walk."
"Changdeokgung Palace is not all that different from Deoksegung (Toksegung) or Duksoo Palace or even Kyongbokkung (Gyeongbukgung) Palace (minus the National Palace Museum) except for the Piwon (Biwon), the Secret Garden that's really more of a large wood and that makes a visit to Changdeokgung really worthwhile. But note that the Piwon is only open to guided tours that are alternatively in Korean, Japanese and English, so make sure to check the schedule and get there early because the tour of the Piwon is very popular. Also, be prepared for a long walk uphill and downhill through the Secret Garden, which must be as large as the gardens at Versailles but is much more rugged terrain. There's a fee for the Secret Garden, but it's only about $5 and it's worth it. I went with a friend on a very hot day in July and it was exhausting but worthwhile. The gift shop has a little cafe and is air conditioned; they also have expensive but nice souvenirs as well as wi-fi (the only place on the grounds of the palace with wi-fi). When you leave, walk out the main gate to the right and walk just a few blocks and you'll be in Bukchon Village, which is also really worthwhile; it's also a good place to eat lunch or dinner."
So I finally got to see beautiful Changdeokgung Palace. I used to only see this in Korean dramas. Historical Korean dramas is doing a great job introducing this palace and sharing so many historical stories. I love watching the changing of the Royal Guards. Will go back again someday since I didn't get to see all of it.
"Another beautiful palace that you can explore alone or with a guided tour. We enjoyed strolling around and exploring by ourselves but the secret garden can only be toured with a guide. It's about an hour and a half in total but you get the choice to leave half way through. And actually at this point you can just go off and explore on your own, no one stopped us, and we could enjoy the peaceful gardens with no other tourists around."
"We visited the palace with our kids and spent an hour on the English speaking tour. Out tour guide was very good, although she reminded me a little too much of JuDee (tour guide from the Avatar cartoons). Beatiful grounds and. Interesting history made this a very worth while location."
"This is especially a good time to tour ancient palaces around Seoul. Entrance fees are waived throughout the month of July 2015, perhaps due to the spread of MERS causing a steady decline of visitors. Besides admiring the exotic ancient architecture, the paid English speaking tour of the Secret Garden is definitely worth it. You will gain in-depth knowledge of the site as well as access areas that are otherwise not open for public tours. If you take the Secret Garden tour, budget at least 2-3 hours for your visit as the tour lasts a bit over an hour."
"I wouldn't call this a must see, but I must say that I really enjoyed it despite the biting cold. One thing I love about Seoul's historical attractions is that they include free English tours, you just have to make sure you have the times right and that you are on time. Unfortunately I missed the last secret garden tour, which is said the be the highlight. Nevertheless, I found the tour to be fun, interesting, and very informative. Really, don't miss the tour, it is 70% of the experience. I found it more interesting than the main palace, Gyeongbukgong, equally beautiful, and much less crowded."
"This is a typical Korean palace, which means a group of many halls with vast spaces in between. It becomes somewhat repetitive after a while, and you do not need a giuded tour to see everything, but do take a tour into the Secret Garden. The giudes speak English really well and are able to tell entertainign stories. The scenery and pavillions are beautifull! Make sure your shoes are comfortablembecause you will be walking up and down a lot on this tour."
"This palace is not as impressive as the Forbidden City in China, but it is definitely a great place to visit in South Korea. Kindly note that there two types of tickets, one where you only visit the palace's grounds, and another for the royal gardens."
"While the palace itself is somewhat repetitive after a few minutes, the secret garden tour isn't. Very beautiful scenery and excellent tour guides. For the palace itself I would suggest visiting the larger palace to the west."
"We booked 4 Secret Garden tour tickets online in advance for the 15:00 tour, as only 50 tickets can be booked online and other 50 to be sold at the site of that day. You need to pay an extra 5,000 won per person for this tour while general admission is only 3,000 won per person. (Secret Garden tour must be guided, while the rest of the general palace can be toured on your own or join another general tour) The 5 different sites in the Secret Garden are located far from each other and we had to walk on sloppy terrains to reach from one place to another. However, the sites are beautifully preserved and maintained, showing many special pavilions in the midst of greenery and waters. The tour will last for 1 half hour. For visitors who have difficulties in walking, you are advised not to join the Secret Garden tour, join the general Changdeokgung Palace tour instead. :)"
We were able to catch the english tour which was so much more informative and interestinf then just walking around by yourself. I found this palace to be much more beautiful and scenic although the buildings itself were much smaller as the gardens and trees were more elaborate then the other palaces. Free admission for the month of july!
This was the one palace we visited and it was an awesome oasis. Be sure to do the Secret Garden tour. Great area to walk around in afterwards and sample local food.
"This palace summarizes the grandeur of the Korean culture at its best. Massive, spacious and busy. The palace is well preserved. Allow 2 hours to fully understand the extravagance of this place and its significance in the Korean culture."
What an extraordinary contrast to the modern surrounds of Seoul. Not to miss this experience as you step back in time and witness history and culture of Korea. This is the location that the Korean language was developed.
"This palace is on the World Heritage List and deserves to be. If you only see one palace in Seoul, make sure it is Changdeokgung. This palace eschews the rigid, identical layout of the other palaces and has more character to it thanks to the lovely gardens and more of the rooms having furniture in them. I took the free English guided tour of the palace and learnt lots about how the palace was used and who lived there. The Secret Garden tour was also enjoyable, seeing all the little ponds and pavilions tucked away in the extensive, forested grounds that feel a world away from the modern city around you. I was disappointed by the other palaces of Seoul, but Changdeokdung is something special and a nice place to visit."
Great area to explore with lots of space around many old buildings. The gardens are impressive. The general area was free but if you have 1.5 hrs pay to visit the Secret Garden. Hard to believe this is in the middle of such a big city.
"A nice palace with the usual decorated roofs, and pleasing complexes of interconnected buildings. The secret garden was fine, but not especially beautiful, and a long organised walk in a large group is not the best way to enjoy it. Maybe at just the right cherry moment it would be worth it (I was a week and a storm or two too late), but otherwise don't worry too much if you miss it."
"Amazing mix of architecture from Korean to the Japanese occupation. I utilized the free English speaking tour guides. Got there and watched the changing of the Royal Guard, a very colourful performance. All in all a great tour"
Gorgeous palace! We were able to go during the week so it wasn't to busy and we really enjoyed it. Id love to go back to check out the secret garden.
The best bit about this palace was the secret garden. You need to take the tour to get in so check times. The English tour was at 11.30 when we went. The garden is green and lush although many trees are dying. Buildings are less reconstructed than the main palace.I find this a good thing. Allow 90 mins.
I only have limited time and always ask for the top attraction and this certainly met the mark. I took the underground there which made it easy to get to. This is a tourist place and after reading about this it is actually a rebuilt but you do not notice this. It truly is beautiful and worth a visit for a few hours to wonder.
The place tour was the highlight as was the changing of the guard. An English audio tour is complimentary and makes it easy to follow.
"It's definitely worthy a visit, not too crowded, very peaceful, right in the heart of the city. Didn't have time to visit the secret gardens, went too late."
Changdeokgung Palace is a don't miss tourist spot in Seoul. it is easy to find and very accessible since it can be reached via Bus or Train. It is a good spot to see the South Korea's ancient structures and also good for the whole family. You can actually purchase a ticket that gives you unlimited access to Seoul's 4 palaces within a specific period of time. Make sure to drop by this place when you visit Seoul.
"This palace is really impressive on its own, however its real attraction lies in the Secret Garden which can only be accessed by booking an inexpensive tour. Check the times for the English language one. The tour lasts over 90 minutes so bring water and sunscreen on a hot day. You can buy a combination ticket for all 5 palaces and the Secret Garden for 10000 won, great deal! It's valid for more than 30 days if I remember correctly. The Secret Garden is the World Heritage Site of this palace and really impressive."
"if u love palace and history, i tink this will be good for u.. But for me, i cant even stay longer for 15mins :)"
"This is a beautiful palace. We love the surrondings and it is challenging to walk during winter as the ground is full of snow and dried ice, quite slippery when you walked on the dried ice. Interesting place to visit if you have the time!"
"Well, you can see the history of Korean, how became the innovated country they are now. This palace in the middle of, the city shows you the contrast of tradition and progress. how Korea can see the future without forgetting the pass."
"All the palaces seem similar, but the exception here is the secrete garden tour, which is a guided hike through a large, hilly, forested area around the palace. It is not really what you would normally consider a garden at all. But each garden area is very nicely done and has traditional buildings. A guided tour must be purchased separately for the garden.

The palace itself is good to quickly look around. But nothing new if you have seen other palaces. Look for tours with your preference if you want, but I don't think it is necessary to enjoy."
Ensure you book a guided tour of the Secret Garden - available in English. Only way to enter Secret Garden is with a guided tour and it is worth to see and hear the stories of this wonderful palace and its garden. The history of Korea is in this palace and the restoration is very well done. The grounds are extensive and a great deal to see for a few hours.
"A beautiful palace, but I loved the guided tour of the 'Secret Garden', which was in English. Be warned, it is a 3 KM walk. It takes you through lovely woodland, stopping off in various oasis' to explore pavilions, lilly ponds and summer residences. It was exceptionally hot, so quite a challenge, but so interesting."
"Booked a free 2 hour English tour through Seoul Tourism website, which is very enjoyable. The palace is not very large, nevertheless it is great to learn the Korean history associated with it."
Highly highly recommended to do the secret garden tour. Excellent guide and beautiful grounds. Also gain insight into lifestyle and activities of past kings of Korea.
A definite worthy visit. Expect a day to tour through this complex. Lots to see!! There may even be a guard inspection reenactment to watch!
The Changdeokgung Palace had a similar layout and spectacular architecture but was a little smaller than the Gyeongbokgung Palace. It has more number of accessible interior rooms to see and has a sort of different history to tell. Worth visiting.
"Must visit place in Seoul, even locals visit this place time to time. I recommend you to have a guide to understand the history about the place. Located behind Modern Art Gallery, near to Insadong & Bookchon."
I've been here twice already and always the ceremony never fails to attract my attention. I like he different costumes that the guards don.I also like the fact that there is a train ride close by.
"Took 2.5 hours and got the English giided tours of the palace (free) and the gardens (500,000) KW. The palace tour at 14:30 ends just before the garden tour begins. A great way to see everything you should see."
Went her after visiting Gyeongbokgung earlier that day using my multi-ticket. Got access to the secret garden with an English speaking guide. Lots of walking and lots to soo
"We were going to go to a different palace but it was closed on the day, so we went here. Basically you should visit one of the palaces whilst in Seoul. They do rotate when they will be closed so there will always be one of the palaces open for viewing. Admission was free. There are poster boards that give you a bit of history in English so tour guide not necessary. When we went there were only 10 people there so it was most peaceful to lose yourself back in time and imagining the palace how it used to be. Right at the back is a gigantic rock which we climb to the top and were rewarded with a wonderful view and great photo opportunity."
"It is huge and a lot of walking is involved.
The changing of the guard' is worth viewing, if not only for the gear they wear.
I enjoyed myself here"
"We visited this palace because it seems to be the prettier palace of Seoul. It is a large area that would require much walking. Luckily, the palace is beautiful and has a distinctive style so it is easy to explore. If you visit, do spare time to join the back garden tour. I'd say the back garden is the prettiest of the place and I understand why it is open only by tours for preservation."
"The palace and its grounds are not just pretty to look at and for photography shoots but knowing its history makes the photos more meaningful. Advisable to schedule with a tour guide because of the significance of each area of the palace, especially the Secret Garden. You'll understand why it is listed as a World Heritage."
"Changdeokgung is the second of Seoul's main palaces (the other being Gyeongbokgung). If anything, Changdeokgung is even prettier than its counterpart. It used to be the case that while Gyeongbokgung could be freely explored at any time, Changdeokgung visitors had to go in as part of a guided tour. I did hear that Thursdays would be opened up for free exploring, but whether this is still current info I'm not sure. In any case, guided tour or not, this place is worth a visit."
Much smaller complex but worth seeing. Definitely see the change of the guards. Make sure you have good walking shoes!
First of all accept that this is a total rebuild-not surprising after the war but it then comes across is quite sterile and there has been little attempt at giving it a old atmosphere- the undisguised fire hydrants really grated- not really worth the effort
"When visiting the palace it is great to see the change of the guards. The costumes, the music and the grandeur of it all makes it spectacular."
"Went to Changddokgung Palace for the first time and was impressed by how ornate the buildings were, along with how maintained it was (which shouldn't have been surprising since it's a UNESCO world heritage site. Browsed the palace grounds on my own and then went on the Secret Garden tour. The garden was beautiful, serene, and relatively cool since there's lots of shade. You'll obviously appreciate the palace grounds more if you brush up on its history, but even if not, it's a nice place to explore and at less than $9 per person (USD) it won't break the bank!"
"Palace is interesting, the best is the secret garden, which demands a special tour, paid separately. Hundreds of stories, curiosities, history at its best."
"This was my favorite palace to visit in Seoul. While not as grand as some others, it is beautiful and has fascinating distinctive sections. We bought a five palace ticket and that allowed us into the secret garden as part of a guided tour. The garden (think of a natural park) was beautiful with its own small structures and lakes. If you visit this palace plan to take a tour of the secrete garden."
It was one the beautiful place that I love when I visited south Korea. Very big and also there always lovely Koreans ladies dress up in traditional dress. Enjoyed my time here with family
"The guard changing ceremony was quite interesting, and got to take photos with the guards. The palace was also very big, but wished there could be more things to see inside the palace."
"For me , interesting , very large grounds and changing of the guards is colourful to watch. Your in Seoul so ya may as well have a look and the buildings are many. Having said that, it is the palace but not unusual depending how long you have been in Asia, if ya get my drift."
"A UNESCO heritage site worth a visit. In fact, if you only have time for one royal palace (of four) I would strongly recommend this one. A lot of it was not destroyed and it is surrounded by beautiful gardens. It has a secret garden which I could not visit because of time constrain."
"Amazing large palace (most rebuilt) and secret garden. Interesting tour in English, beside Bukchon hanook traditional village."
"In the middle of Seoul, There is a place you must visit. It is a Changdeokgung Secret Garden. It is definitely an unmissable place when you come to Korea. There are three reasons why you should put the Secret garden on your tour list.

First, it is a historically meaningful place. It has been about 600 years since Changdeokgung Palace was constructed in 1405. At first it was built for the purpose of second royal villa, but then Changdeokgung Palace had become a primary royal residential palace for the longest time as many Joseon Dynasty kings loved this place. The Secret Garden was especially a haven for the kings because it was a very private space where the kings could evade the strict court’s life. They usually spent their spare time reading, fishing and strolling there. While walking through the garden, you can imagine what it would be like to be a Joseon king.

Secondly, it is an eye-pleasing place. The garden was kept as natural as possible. The buildings were designed to make a good harmony with the surroundings, so all the trees, hillsides, streams and rocks are integral parts of the garden. The garden is filled with various kinds of plants and trees. There are more than hundred different kinds, and some are over 400 years old. Therefore, you might feel like you are in the middle of an arboretum. It’s a magical place just to look at as the structures blend perfectly into the nature.

Lastly, it is a perfect place for tourists. Special tour programs are held every spring and they offer English, Chinese and Japanese guided tours. The tour takes about an hour and gives you an explanation of the historical significance of the constructions. Besides, Changdeokgung Secret Garden has a great location where people can easily come by public transportation. Also, Insadong (where you can enjoy lots of Korean traditional crafts, street foods and art galleries) and Gyeongbokgung (where is another gorgeous palace of Joseon Dynasty) are both within walking distance from Chandeokgung. Therefore, tourists can find various attractions and it’s easy for them to make touring plans.

As shown above, the Secret Garden is worth visiting. If you are making plans to visit Seoul, I suggest you visit Changdeokgung Secret Garden. One thing to remember is, if you want a guide tour, you should book it before the visit. You can make a reservation at the Chandeokgung website: http://eng.cdg.go.kr/main/main.htm. Don’t forget to book and enjoy the tour."
"This was the only palace we had gone to, but should have picked Gyeongbokgung on hindsight. This was a secondary palace with a garden, which was pretty but gets boring after a while. It was one pavilion after another (after a while, every pavilion looks the same and barely excites).

We went on the English tours of the palace and the secret garden, and it took us 2.5 hours. What was nice is that it managed to take us back in time to the chosun period. But i would recommend it only if you have visited the main palace and wants to see more."
"I had choice 3 palace in seoul ,I choice changdeokgung ,it was rigth decision ,it was not far from hotel I spent 4 hours amazing beautiful paintings and wood craft,I recomend you to buy picture of this palace"
"The grounds and gardens were very pretty, with some interesting historic buildings, most were rebuilt. The English tour was worth taking. Although not as impressive as many palaces in other countries, it was still worth a visit to understand some of Korean history."
The palace is very large with magnificent gardens right in the middle of Seoul. Take a lunch and enjoy the grounds. There are English tours every hour but very easy to do on your own.
"I think after visiting Japan, I was not so impressed by Changdeokgung Palace. I must have been all templed and palaced out!

There was a LOT of other tourists here. Very busy. The changing of the guard looks kinda cool, til you realise they are just all actors, and pretty bad ones at that.

The palace and the grounds are beautiful though. Bring good walking shoes, the place is big and ground pretty uneven in some spots."
"In case you are a business traveller, and have very little time to see through the rich Korean history in Seoul, this place (Changdoekgung) along with the other one in heart of city (Gyeongbukgung) would be an ideal place for an afternoon short trip - it's well possible to squeeze any of these palaces between your morning meetings and evening drinking sessions...

Changdeokgung is the only UNESCO World Heritage site out of the Five Grand Palaces built by Joseon dynasty which ruled Korea. Magnificent piece of authentic ancient Korean architecture.

There are many tour operators who offers a package of Changdoekgung with night markets etc., but you will need to enquire first whether they will take you into the 'Secret Garden'... you SHOULD NOT miss it. I booked with an operator, and upon learning that they will only provide entry to the palace and not the 'Secret Garden', I decided to abandon the tour midway and be on my own.

The palace and 'Secret Garden' tickets are sold separately, and 'Secret Garden' is opened to a batch of tourists with a Palace guide guiding you on the trail once every 15-30 mins. So, you may have to get in there, and plan for a secret garden ticket with a slot an hour at least from when you reach (sometimes there is quite a rush, and number of tickets per slot is limited to a maximum 30 ish). I spent the hour seeing the palace, and then went for the Secret Garden tour, which is technically 70% of the palace area.

It was worth a wait. Lush-green tree-rows with beautifully crafted lake-houses .... the flora was just amazing. ... I wonder if I liked the whole trail so much in summer, how good it will be during the spring season..

The only flip-side which I will regret - taking a Korean tour of 'Secret Garden' [every slot of Secret Garden tour is in a specific language and only few were in English] since the next English tour available was still couple of hours more of wait. so couldn't make much out of the context. But hey.. you always have a Wikipedia, it's the visual and other sensory experiences that matter..."
I like the atmosphere of the place and that they are foreign-friendly. They really hire people who knows how to speak different languages so that it won't be difficult for us. I just hope they add a traditional clothing that we can rent aside from the guard clothings
Architecture again is superb and the lay out for walking while feasting with all the building was wonderful. We watched the changing of the guard palace and the manuever that goes with it and later allowed to pose with the participant was a big plus for me as a visitor. it is must to see.
"I like the fact that the palace is quite close to Insa-Dong. It is a huge palace. This is probably irrelevant, but the washroom was so immaculate :).

The secret garden tour is good but it was way too long and the group is way too big, so it is very hard to follow what was explained by the tour guide. If you want to take it, book it through its website in advance. Although I like this palace, I won't recommend the garden tour especially if you don't have a lot of time in Seoul."
"Very interesting complex / palace not far away from the city centre. Must see on a sightseeing map in Seoul. Very nice place for a walk and sightseeing, especially with the guide. I was on a 1 day trip in Seoul, Ms. Guide was very nice and funny, she spoke very good English, so there was no problem to understand everything she said. Probably single trip would be more interesting, than in a group of random ppl, but I didn't have time for organizing everything by myslef. The company did pick-up from the hotel, so I didnt have to worry about anything. Unfortunately I dont remember how was the trip called and via what company. I've ordered it from the hotel. Beautiful place worth to spend time there!"
"It's nice to go if you already know about the history of the palaces. There is a lake and it's pretty quiet. The ticket price is 1000w for one palace and 3000w to the other one, I just went in the first one."
This was one of the first temples we visited and it's a good introduction to temple structure. You find out how the family is housed separately and the interesting sub-floor heating system that was used plus the design and color of the roof lines and how they indicated the standing of the person housed in that building.
"There was a lot to look at, and the secret garden tour was very nice, however I think lots of people agree, and it was very crowded. Good for a first time visit though!"
A smaller version of the Forbidden City/Imperial Palace in Beijing and I found this more inviting. The tour guide was amazing in telling the stories of those who lived there and what life was like. You can spend the entire day there or just a few minutes to get the feeling of being transported back in time.
"Accesible via mrt Anguk station exit 3. Better to catch-up the ""Secret Garden Tour"" with English Guide at 11:30, 13:30 or 15:30. You can also do reservation of tickets online in advance due to limited capacity. We paid 8000 KRW for the entrance and secret garden tour."
"This palace is definitely the best of all palaces in Seoul. You can easily spend there three hours, especially if you take Secret Garden excursion. There are many buildings belonging to the palace complex, and thus, many narrow backstreets that you can wander around. Secret Garden is beautiful place indeed. Water, pavillions, occasional racoons :) The only problem with excursion was the guide herself. Her tone of speaking was kinda arrogant and snobish. May be it is just lost in translation problem. The route and stops are tightly scheduled, up to minute. So we were commanded all the time where to go, when to go, when to stop. It felt like we are back to school with teacher. However, you have time to catch the spirit of the place and make enough of photos. I definitely recommend to visit this palace, especially if you have limited time."
"Pretty awesome to see the historical palace grounds at Changdeokgung! Make sure to book the tour of the Secret Garden at least a day or two in advance if you want the english version (can be done online or by most hotel concierges) for only 8,000 krw per person."
"You have to go, one of the best things we did in our trip to the area. We liked the old park area also. A few hours is enough and best towards the start of end of the day, when more locals to take photos off. Tommy"
The palace was nice to see. The entrance of the palace and the secret garden includes a free tour also in english. The palace was big and both tour took around 3 hours. Maybe we are not a fan of history but wanted to see one palace but it was not that spectacular.
This palace is the most beautiful and its history is the best. I find this place very historic as well as romantic. Try to visit Secret Graden (Huwon) too when visiting this place!
"With Huwon (Secret Garden) at the back, this is a great Palace to explore. If only the bridge to Jungmyo was still there, it would be even better.
This Palace has lots of history than Gyeongbukgong. if I remembered correctly from the guided tour. And the story about the last Prince (or was it King?), who rebuilt a quarter especially for his lover, was so romantic.
If you are not travelling with kids, I really recommend that you have to follow the guided tour as the guide knows so much."
"This palace has a more romantic feel since it's far less crowded than its bigger brother and yet doesn't fail to amaze with beauty.

Wouldn't say that I didn't enjoy Gyeongbokgung but this one is more fun to spend time in."
"In my opinion, this palace is much more worth visiting compared to Gyeongbokgung Palace. The minute I stepped onto the palace ground, the palace seems to reach out to you, eager to share its history with you. The palace is of a considerable size and you need to take your time to appreciate each and every building. As the halls and living quarters are built apart from each other, every time I looked into a hall or a living quarter, I try to imagine how life was like for a royalty back in the Joseon period. It would be great if you can hire a guide or get an audio guide to help better understand the rich history of the palace. As I went to the palace after mid-noon, we missed the guided tour to the Secret Garden located just beside the palace. Make sure you check the timing for the English tour and head down early to book a spot. I really enjoyed this palace and since I didn't get to visit the Secret Garden, I definitely have a valid reason to revisit again!"
"If you have the time, it is good to visit this place. But if you have visited china and Beijing, specially Forbidden City, this place will not excite you much. But it is good to visit and find out the difference between chines and Korean culture."
"This is not the palace that everyone typically goes to, which is nice. It is still quite busy. I was encouraged to visit this palace because of the Secret Garden Tour. I believe the English tour is at 1:30pm, but you should get there a little early as it starts from the back of the palace (not near the entrance). The Secret Garden tour was incredibly beautiful and the tour guide is extremely punctual, which keeps the tour moving. I really enjoyed it."
Took the free guided tour which was very helpful and highly recommended. The palace grounds are beautifully laid out and well maintained. The guide's commentary really made the visit worthwhile and gave us a good glimpse of daily courtyard life and some of the historical details.
We went for a special open night in the early evening - lanterns were lit along the paths and on the little lake and there was entertainment to see as well. A large area and lovely for an evening walk.
"The palace is located farther away from the city center and is actually quit peaceful. I would recommend going sometime in the late morning or around noon since the crowd dies down. The admission is pretty cheap as well, definitely recommend going to the secret garden as we'll. Also right next door to insadong and bukchon for some shopping if that is what your into as well."
if you go in the morning early you can see the parade they do showing tourists how was long time ago...that was very nice and i even record an almost half hour video....very interesting
"I liked the fact that the temples are blended perfectly with the surrounding forest and the amazing colors of buildings. Also I liked the tour of the gardens (only in a group), so make sure you don't skip it. Try to let the group walk ahead and enjoy the silence and will let you to take amazing photos."
"This got to be a guided tour. We want without a guide and walked ard the palace, not really knowing the historical background except for the brief reads online. Wear comfortable shoes as the palace is huge. Take photos with the guards, girls in hanbok and wait for the procession walk."
"I was feeling a little disappointed with Seoul after traveling around Japan previously until I came here. I got there just in time for a secret garden tour and headed straight there. It was amazing, the guide had lots of great information and there are some beautiful spots.
It should be the no.1 thing to do in Seoul!"
This palace is very close to downtown core of Seoul and very close to the subway station. It looks like an oasis in the middle of a vibrant city. The elegance of the design is fantastic. An architectural wonder from my point of view. The paintings and carvings are stunning. If you can catch the time where the soldiers in traditional clothes take part in a ritual; it will be a great experience and also a great attraction for kids. The size of the drums is incredible by the way. A 2 hour trip will be enough to enjoy this palace and it is pretty cheap.
Worth to visit and plunge into history. If you are interested in the insights of the place my advise is to take a guide.
"ChangDok Palace served as the backup palace when the main KyongBok Palace was not able to function. So ChangDok is the moon as KyongBok is the sun. The grounds are a restorative green respite from the modern busy-ness that is Seoul, and if you can avoid the crowds, like I did yesterday, due to the rain, it is tranquil and restorative to walk around the grounds to take in the oxygen and the thousands of years of restored history and atmosphere."
"Went in with the free English guided tour. I think this is a must for them to explained the history, culture and the meanings. Probably in general it is the same for the others palaces as well -- Gyeongbukgung, Deoksukgung. The only difference will be in the details. The secret garden is ok but truly a very long walk and especially not for those too tired after visiting other areas in Seoul. Its a series of walk up and down small hills. And I have visited much more beautiful gardens in Kyoto."
"Unlike Gyeongbokgung, this palace is more like residence so you can see a few building like home. I joined the moonlight tour and it was the best night tour ever, the guide explained well about the palace, and the sad story about the king and the concubine.

But the ticket to secret garden are separate, so you have to buy an extra one if you want to visit."
"Again another beautiful palace. Lovely to have a wonder around and have a few coffees. This is a must visit for any visitor to Seoul and I don't think you will be disappointed. Plenty of photo opportunities- make sure you don't miss the Secret Garden!!

Hopefully a helpful tip- you can walk between Changdeokgung and Changgyeonggung Palace. We stupidly exited the latter and got hop on bus to next stop. Think we missed some sights doing this."
"So cheap to get in and we loved the guided tour of the Secret Garden. So much to see and explore. Not only foreigners, but there were also plenty of locals exploring the palace, which was a delight to see (since some even wore Hanbok). The area surrounding the palace also had some hanuks and local artisan shops you can explore."
"The buildings are more or less like those in Gyeongbokgung except that they are less grand and elegant. The highlight of Changdeokgung is the Secret Garden that takes up almost 60% of the entire area of the palace. The palace was loved more than any other palace by the kings of Joseon Dynasty because of the spacious and beautiful garden at the back. Preserving the original topography, garden areas were planted in each valley and a series of lotus ponds were built. Small pavilions were also built along the stream that flows through the rear garden. The Secret Garden was intended as a place of kings and royal family members to relax. Outstanding among the sights are Aeryeonji, Soyoam Rock and Buyongji."
"there's required to join a guided tour to Secret Garden.
we meet new friend from japan while joining secret garden Japanese language tour,
great view & nice walk~!"
"If you've ever been to Kyoto or Beijing, this palace might not do much for you.

If you've never seen a place like this in Asia, I suppose it would be quite impressive.

The gardens are well maintained and it was clean.

Lots of obnoxious high schoolers running around unsupervised, making noise, etc.

If you're in Seoul you should go, but compared to some of the other places in Asia I have been, it wasn't that great.

Just my opinion."
"The palace secret garden is pretty average. I would have been OK to pay 5000won to get in but the experience was marred by a poorly organised tour and a rude tour guide by the name of Kim.

Firstly there were more than 100 pple on the tour but there was only one guide. This meant that if u didn't keep up with the guide you would have essentially missed the explanations

Secondly I had asked the tour guide a simple question because I missed it in her very accented English explanation. However she rolled her eyes and gave me a curt reply ""I have alr said it earlier"" to cut me off.
Seriously didn't think that was necessary.

Skip this tour if u have something better to do."
Waking up early to purchase tickets for the secret garden tour is worth it. The guide was entertaining and the view is incredible.
"centrally located, magnificiant palace with beautiful gardens. A lot of walking around there so make sure you have plenty of time."
"I enjoyed visiting this centrally located palace one Sunday afternoon when I was in Seoul for a work trip. The changing of the guards at 2pm was colourful and unique -many photo opportunities and they even allow you to pose for photos with the main guard. The palace was very interesting to visit, though it seems a tour of the 'secret garden' was something I missed. It was quick to get to, cheap and well worth the time."
"Magnificent palace buildings and grounds, wander around to ensure that the atmosphere sinks in. Make sure that you do the Secret Garden as its more than a garden , but a large area of ornate plantings and pavilions. when we were ther is was aspecila week where one could opt out of the guided tour and wander at will through the garden which was immensely better than the rigidity of the guided tour. (this happens only occasionally so check if this week happens when you visit (ours was in early May))"
We joined the tour and really had a great time learning about the history of the palace. Highly recommend this! Also check out the secret garden!
"Not only is the palace simply wonderful, I highly recommend booking a Secret Garden tour online to ensure you'll be able to see and learn about a magnificent area that was truly kept secret for centuries! Secret Garden tour reservation website: http://eng.cdg.go.kr/reservation/reserv_01.htm

The Geumcheongyo Bridge in the palace is the oldest one still in existence in Seoul! It's from 1411! Have fun getting lost in the different areas of the palace."
Absolutely awesome. I recommend the Secret Garden Tour. The tour lasts about 1.5 hours and costs an extra 5000won.... but totally worth it
"I was very lucky to have joined a Moonlight Tour at Changdeokgung Palace organized by Korea Cultural Heritage Foundation, Ministry of Culture, Sports, Tourism and Cultural Heritage Administration on May 4th 2015. Visiting these beautiful palaces in Seoul, during the day is a completely different experience when visiting them at night. I had a surreal, wonderful time during 2-hour tour; walking around Changdeokgung Palace and in the Secret Garden; with the full moon that night, it felt like we were in another era. The traditional dance, gayageum and pansori performances gave me goosebumps; and that tour was the best part of my visit to Seoul. :)"
"I underestimated the size of this palace but there is such a lot to see! Plan in enough time, get yourself a map and walk all the different walks to make the best out of your visit. By the way, entry is free when you wear a hanbok.

If you have enough time, make sure you also visit the Secret Garden, which no longer is so secret but still amazing with its insane variety in flora!"
"The Secret Garden Tour was 90 mins long. There were portions of the tour/walk that were quite a steep climb up and steep descent down. Not recommended for the elderly or heavily pregnant.

From the entrance where you purchase & collect the tickets, it's a short walk to the starting point of the Secret Garden. Give yourself some time to queue for tickets and walk to the starting point of the tour. If the tour starts at 11.30am, try to be there by 11.00am.

The English guide's accent was quite strong making it rather difficult to understand what he was saying. Due to the heat, the number of people on the tour (more than 50) and the difficult-to-understand English by the guide, I didn't really enjoy the tour.

One would probably enjoy the tour/scenery (and weather) at the Secret Garden a lot more in spring or autumn."
"Great place to snap a pics especially. But dont forget your sunglasses... because if the wind blow so hard, the sand might get into your eyes. Averall. I love historic place"
We waited for the session of English tour guide and went into the Secret Garden with her. It was quite a up and down long tour. Not recommended for elder and ppl who r lazy to walk up and down hill. The scenery was nice!
"Great palace, allow to travel back in time. We really liked it although its huge and needs some time to explore :)"
Very beautiful area with a better aura than the main palace. Unfortunately did not get to go to the Secret garden. The cherry blossoms were out when we went which made the place even more pretty.
I visited the palace in April which made the tour of the gardens really beautiful as everything was in bloom. All the palaces buildings in this area are pretty similar but the gardens are what make this site a bit special.note that that the gardens can only be see on a tour which you can reserve onlinr
This was our favorite palace in the city! A little smaller in scale then the more prominent palace at center of city but that made it all the more lovely. Beautiful brick details. Lots of little spaces to wander through without a big crowd. Nice setting in landscape park. Worth the effort.
Beautiful place with lovely gardens. This is one of the places you shouldn't miss if you are in Seoul. You should include a visit to the Secretive Gardens.
"This palace is beautiful, on top of it being quiet and peaceful, you can also visit the Secret Garden which is breathtaking."
"While it was a very cold day, the sun was shining and it was a wonderful walk around the secret gardens and then the palace later. Well worth the trip."
"Unfortunately it is only possible to go to the secret garden by a tour that takes 1.5h (would be amazing to discover individually!). But the views are stunning, it's a oasis in the middle of the city, pretty well located (near Anguk) and probably nice from early spring to late autumn.
Small ponds, pavillons, old trees and hills make it beautiful to walk through there.
3'000 for entrance of the palace area plus 5'000 for the tour - definetly worth it!"
"if you have never been to Asia and this is the only sight seeing you will do, then this is a nice palace to start but if you have been to other major cities in Asia, this is not impressive. It would not even make the top 100 in Kyoto."
Very nice tour with a guided tour section of the Secret garden. Can visit the whole palace within couple of Hours and within walking distance from he main gyeongbokgung Palace. A must see if you are visiting Soul.
"A well preserved palace in the heart of Seoul. Guided tours are available. Architecturally, the palace takes a lot of it's design from the Chinese."
"This is another castle which is rebuild. As I wrote about Gyeongbokgung castle: you just can't rebuild history - it'll be a fake history. Better build something entirely new, but don't copy."
"I went to Gyeongbokgung palace before going to this palace, and boy, what a difference. Changdeokgung is beautiful, has much more English information, and the Secret Garden is amazing. I was especially amazed by the ancient trees and the different styles of the buildings. Too bad there was no audio guide!"
"Personally, I would choose this Palace over the other palaces. It is the UNESCO one and it was more balanced and beautiful. I am not sure if the ""Secret Garden"" tour was worth it. It is a lot of walking, FYI and takes 1 hour or so."
"Easy to get to, cheap entry price (we did self guided), and a good way to spend 1.5 - 2 hours. Lovely displays, and even a nice kids area."
I wish we would have allotted more time to explore. I believe were there for about an hour and we didn't have time to fully explore. The time of the day were there (or the day of the week--not sure) the secret garden was not open for viewing. It was a truly beautiful place with a lot of interesting nooks to go into.
The palace grounds are much smaller and more intimate than Gyeongbokgung Palace - and definitely not as crowded. We took a guided tour of The Secret Garden but in the pouring rain which made it a little difficult to enjoy the scenery. Still worth the time and money to see - a nice contrast from the bigger palace.
"I do not want to sound negative, but I have seen better palaces before. We could only see very little the historical era of the kingdom. The plants are brownish due to the autumn season, there was only one cherry blossom tree BUT when I tried to get nearer to the tree I was stopped - apparently there was a ribbon limiting tourist's access. Well - I like the restaurant nearby though."
"A very nicely built and maintained palace with a paid visit to the garden which requires a little bit of walking. Tours available in English, Korean and Chinese and the guides are very nice. Great trees and flowers to explore at different seasons.

An inspiring experience to think about how the royals spent their day in the past in the big area."
This palace is close to station and very nice and charming palace. The atmosphere is very relaxing and it is close to the Bukchon Village. Enjoyed the beautiful Cherry Blossom tree in the garden.
"I did the Secret Garden tour. The tour guide was rude to me and did not attempt to control our group. There was a very loud family with our group and at times would drown out our tour guide's voice. Some of us on the tour wanted to hear the history of the palace, but could not because of the constant talking and noise from this large family.

I went in the spring, so probably not as lovely as the summer. The trees were bare and not much green foliage."
"We previously reserved English guided tour to Huwon garden on 13.oo on palace web site,before it we went to palace itsel fand explore ,guided tour on secret garden last about 45-50 minutes ,there were nice places ,but I think in summer and in fall Huwon garden is better to visit,since in end of March the trees just began blossom."
"It was very hot in August, not much special to see.
I didn't think there was anything special.Secret Garden was worth visit to see the palace, some exquisite decoration, and beautiful flowers."
"Korea has very distinct seasons - so when you want to visit is very important. We went in August - so very hot (over 90 Fahrenheit, 32 Celsius) and humid. Also, none of the changing colors of Autumn or blooming flowers of Spring. We signed up for an English tour which was very good. We also paid extra for access to the secret garden and it was just o.k."
"I didn't think there was anything special here that set it apart from other palaces. Even with the Secret Garden, it was a pretty disappointing garden. Maybe it might look nicer in the fall? Spring is definitely not it's best time.

There were some cherry blossoms around the palace, which is what people were mostly interested in, it seemed. This palace was pretty expensive compared to others that are only 1000 won. Also, the Secret Garden tour is mandatory, you can't go in on your own. I don't know why, because I wasn't interested in a tour. Infact, I stayed at the very back of my group so I could photograph as my group left the area, and hung back by myself. I suggest to do this. I wasn't really interested in hearing about a place I could just google about online. I'm definitely more into taking my time and exploring/photographing."
"The Palace is large with more buildings to see than is at first apparent but keep walking and looking, especially inside to view highly decorated ceilings. The Secret Garden is an even larger area with many steep steps and you have to stay with guide so that was disappointing, we prefer to walk at own pace..It is beautiful. Admission to Palace is free for over 65 but one must pay for Secret Garden ($5)."
"I visited the Palace for the second time in a year and I liked the atmosphere of imperial Korea and the surrounding gardens (fully developed in August, blossoming in April). Make sure you have at least 2-3 hours to spend there!"
Palace is well-kept and even with the crowds can be enjoyable. I'd say it's the #2 palace in Korea. The garden is a hidden gem and beautiful in the spring. You won't find one in at any other palace.
"Spent a morning here, ticket price of 3000 includes free guided tour. The English one runs at 10.30am, once that finishes if you have purchased the Secret Garden ticket (5000) you can join the 11.30am tour for that.

The tour through the main palace was informative and a good overview in about 50mins. Would recommend it to get a good understanding of the architecture and history. Yes it is no where on the same scale as Forbidden City but I found it enjoyable all the same.

The Secret Garden is beautiful and visiting in spring time with the blossoms out is really magical. The tour is 1.5hours and does feel very rushed. You have to stay with the guide all the time and on the 5 stops during the tour you have between 5-10mins to look around by yourself. The group size was about 100 people. Walking through the forest is wonderful and this part is definitely the highlight of the Palace visit."
We were there simply because of the secret garden tour and it's quite interesting. It's a bit rush and there were hardly enough time to take pictures if you want to keep up with the tour guide for the explanation.
"Be sure to visit this palace. it is not that far from the main palace that every visitor to seoul would have visited. There are less crowd here, and more space to relax and ponder upon the architectures."
"We took an English language tour of the palace. Such a deal at W3,000. Although this palace is not as nice historically since it was rebuilt in the 19th century and 20th century after the Japanese occupation, it is a great historical experience and can be beautiful almost any time of year. A super orientation to the Seoul experience."
"The palace grounds itself is quite small relative to the others, but still interesting none the less. I enjoyed going to the back areas looking for hidden places to take some great shots with a lot less visitors in the way. Read the descriptions of the areas as they are quite fascinating especially if you don't want to be tied to a tour group.

The garden is what you're really here for, so don't skip it! I've only been here during autumn (October), so I can't attest to how it looks in other seasons, but nonetheless it is an amazingly beautiful place. You can't take enough pictures and videos of it all. The falling leaves and blossoms are definitely a sight to behold!

It's best to visit the garden when you aren't in a rush, so you can take it all in, take as many pictures as you want, and just stroll through this beautiful and relaxing place. It's not too overrun by tourists so there are plenty of moments of near silence which makes for a very peaceful place to escape to. :)

I wouldn't personally recommend going in a tour group unless that's your kind of thing. I broke off and just went roaming around at my own pace!"
"Catch the changing of the guards, a 15 min pageant and afterwards pictures with the guards is allowed. If you visit the palace better to have a guide with you to explain the details and history of this palace."
Changdeokgung Palace is a great place to visit in Seoul. It still has quite some (almost) original remainders - for sure more than at Gyeonbokgung - and the whole atmosphere of the Palaces and environment are great. Make sure to get a ticket for the Secret Garden - best book them in advance over the internet - as this will show you the great gardens from the Korean kings in the 15-19th century with all its beauty.
"It was kinda cool but not much to it, what you see is what you get. Nothing inside not much substance, even the secret garden was boring.."
"Old palace where the emperor used to live. Judging from the space, with a lot of soldiers and concubines. I gather it has been rebuilt completely after many years of ravages, but it was worth the trouble. The largest wooden building in Seoul, they say, which is rather surprising as it is not THAT large. I liked the gay decorations and, especially, the complicated roof ridges.
Adjoining is another palace (how many palaces did those guys need?) and a ""secret garden"". Didn't see those.
We got free entrance upon showing our boarding passes and passports."
"Very colorful and the drums were loud and fun.
The palace itself is bigger than Forbidden City in Beijing"
"It can get really noisy, would be nicer if tour guides would have louder speaker. Beautiful architecture. I love how they explain the history of the structures. The Secret Garden I think would be nice in autumn or summer. I just wish we were informed ahead of time how steep the uphill and downhill walks are. I am not sure if it is to be recommended for elderlies, people with kids, or in heels. Overall, worth a visit."
"One of the best palaces in Seoul, it is better to combine its visit with the Secret Garden, that is an extra 5000 wons (plus the 3000 of the general entry), and only available as a guided tour. The tour lasted about 90 minutes, but it didn´t feel long, as we strolled through the different areas in the garden while getting useful information about the use of the different halls and palaces. My tourist guide recommended to book this tour in advance, but I didn´t have any problem to get a place arriving only a few minutes before starting (English). It was a weekday, and not particularly busy.
Highly recommended."
"I wandered around this beautiful complex with free admission, because I had turned up on the last Wednesday of the month (great tip if you are in the city at this time!). It is easy to spend a couple of hours here, exploring the buildings and grounds. You can also take a tour of the Secret Garden - this has to be a tour and there are limited tickets, so be sure to get there early for a tour in your language. Well worth the extra fee though - so tranquil."
"Cultural significant architectural with histories. Geongbukong Palace is huge, you need to spent at least 2 hours to discover the beauty of the Palace, and it worth it."
This palace is connected to the Changyeonggung Palace and you can see both of them right after another. Make sure you buy the combo ticket though so you can save some money when you see all 5 grand palaces. This one isnt as big as the others but it is still beautifully done in the Joseon-era Architecture and is worth the time to visit it. You can also pay to visit the Secret Garden for something like $3.
"The palace is a small one surrounded by trees, located behind Changgyeonggung palace. It looks like Japanese temple rather than a palace."
"I arrived at the palace at 10.30am, just in time for the free English tour guide! It’s amazing and since it’s low peak season, it’s not even crowded, and thus you’ll have plenty of good time here. The tour took about 50mins, and then I proceed with the Secret Garden tour, which required about 1.30hrs. So if you would like to explore this palace properly, allocate about 2.5hrs for it.

Personally I think this is really worth the time (maybe I’m not a shopping freak), but must with the guide so that you know what is why the palace was constructed in such a way. Highly recommended. Nearby the station has plenty of nice food after your palace exploring, and walking distance to Hanok Village & Insadong, so it’s worth coming here!"
"The only way to get into the garden is with a tour, it's about USD $3 more. Going completely solo and taking a decent amount of pictures it took me about 45 minutes to see the palace grounds (which was a bit rushed) and still make my Secret Garden tour. Make sure you arrive a few minutes early - they limit the size of the tour group!
Some people ended up getting bounced to a tour 30 minutes later just because they strolled up on time rather than 5-7 minutes early.

The Secret Garden is great to see, but in March nothing is yet in bloom so 90 minutes can feel a bit long. Still, the guides are good and speak excellent English."
"The palace can be viewed from the 13th floor of the City Hall building to your left (as you stand facing the palace gate). Walk down the side street along the palace wall (very charming) and head to the left to City Hall. There is a coffee and pricey gift shop which is only open on the weekends. Go through the lobby to the elevator and ride to the 13th floor (I believe)--and enjoy. The view is especially beautiful in the fall when the leaves have turned. Sharing this secret may make my hidden gem too well known, but enjoy."
"Entrance to Secret Garden need additional fees and checked the timetable before attempt Secret Garden tour as it must be guided by their staff.

Architecture are nice. Read the explanation board beside each zone to get more information about each building."
One can see how the old royals lived based on the rooms and furnishings inside the palace. Nice place to visit but very dusty because of the strong winds that day. You have to wear closed shoes and a good pair of sunglasses during the day to keep off the dust.
"Really small & boring. I was expected to be wowed, guess the Forbidden Palace did that already. Guard changing was a bit of a joke."
A well preserved / rebuilt palace of the Joseon Dynasty that shows how these royals lived years ago. Unclear how much has been rebuilt over the years. Its a very nice UNESCO World Heritage Site and worth a visit.
"The palace area in the heart of Seoul is a sight to see. Make sure you give yourself at least 2-3hrs to see the sights within the palace boundaries. Also, make sure you either join a group or buy a explanatory leaflet to help you figure out what each palace was used for (and to find out their very interesting names as well). Well worth the visit even on a tight schedule and no matter what your group consists of."
"Don't miss the Palace's Changing of the Guard, held several times a day. The most elaborate, colorful -- as well as the loooongest -- I've ever seen."
"Loved this place and my only regret is that my family and myself only spent less than 3 hours here.
Amazed that the buildings and surrounding facilities are well-kept and maintained. The guide is also knowledgeable and was able to give us an interesting history of how the royals once lived on this marvelous compound."
"It's a good place to understand a bit of Korea imperial past. But if you have been to Beijing & had visited The Forbidden City or even some of the princes residents, Cheongdeokung will look very shabby as compared to them."
"it was an easily accessible and quick experience as we didn't do a tour (had already done another palace tour)
We came for the change of the guards, which was pretty cool, with amusing music, especial the trumpet. Amusingly, most of the guards cannot grow beards, so they have fabric glues to their face.
Still, some of the ""guards"" do not play the part of military discipline very well, (you can sometimes see them swing their arms and shift their legs in boredom.) however this is only really something you notice if you've seen real military discipline of royal guards, so it's forgivable"
"Beautiful but a lot of areas were closed, some walking need to be done and it was a cold rainy day
Went to this Palace without a guide
Ticket is about $3
UNESCO World Heritage Palace"
"We visited this Palace on a free tour out of the Incheon Aiport. It was part of the Seoul Culture Tour - a free 5 hour tour (10 am to 3 pm) provided by the airport for passengers on long layovers. It was very cold - 10 Celsius, and the Airport even provided free down parkas. The Palace is well preserved. It was educational and picturesque. We learned a lot about Korean history and culture and very much enjoyed this introduction Korea. Per our guide the best time to visit South Korea is March and April. Winter is cold and summer is hot and muggy."
Very interesting Palace. Best to go on an English guided tour. If you miss the English tour buy the English guide for a couple of dollars.
"We only wanted to visit one palace as we had two kids with us. This one was recommended in all travel books as the one you have to see.
We went early morning and just missed the crowd who came after 11am. You can buy a ticket for the palace grounds only to walk around on your own or join two of the free english tours (the first one is at 10:30am, the second one I think in the early afternoon). They also sell a combined ticket palace and secret garden, but the garden is only available with a tour (english 10:30, 90 min).
The palace is well maintained, houses look nice and colourful. The ticket price is not too bad for a nice walk through and we spend around 1 hour there.
I missed some more signage and explanations about the different kind of buildings. There is only an introduction at the entrance. So make sure you read a little bit in advance. And I would have loved to see more interior. Apart from that it was a nice visit."
"If you have never been to China and visited the palaces around the Forbidden City, then this will be a good experience of an Asian palace. if you have visited Beijing and toured even the palaces of the princes, then you can skip this.

It's much smaller than I thought and may be it had to do with the Korean history, but the palace seems to be pretty basic. Like a poor man's version of the Forbidden City."
I have taken a lot of picture there as no one visit there. So I have lots of couple / single picture without any 'tourist' background. that is plus to it/ the palace is NOT well maintained.
"Its my first time to Korea and the tours guides are great. very professional and managed well, sign of good training.the buildings are maintained very well and so on the grounds, I hope they keep up the good work!"
"Don't miss !!! It's UNESCO World Heritage. Many mice & interesting pavilions / buildings here. If you have more time, don't forget to check out ""Huwon Garden"" in the back part. (Pay separate)"
It was a very informative tour given by the local guide. We also saw a great performance by the palace guards. Overall it was a great way to spend a few hours learning about there culture.
Changdeokgung Palace is a must do if in Korea. Is nice to see inside and outside and has a nice museum there too. Be sure to end your trip with a 100 m walk up the side and into the popular tourist area for a nice snack and coffee.
I decided to visit the palace as I had never seen something like this before. There was a relatively cheap entrance fee and there were not many people so the trip was very slow paced and relaxing. The grounds are quite large so give yourself about 2 hours to see it properly and read the information boards along the way which explain the historical significance of the palace. There are many buildings to see and appreciate the architecture of the time. There are guards at the front gate wearing traditional costume with whom you can take some photos with if you wish. I enjoyed it very much.
"The ancient architecture is beautiful even in the depths of winter's chill. So, take a quick tour or enter the palace."
We only had time to visit one palace so we wanted to make it count. This was inexpensive to visit and easy to walk around. There were a lot of people but it was not an issue. This is a good representative of what you can expect as far as korean palaces go.
"This palace reminds me of the Forbidden Palace of China a lot. A lot of similarity can be found in this palace with the one in China, well Korean people are basically china predecessor also, Korean languange was made the first time by the 1st emperor who live in this palace, changed from the original languange of chinese.
Not many thing you can see in this palace, but you can feel what it's like to be the emperor and his subordinate who everyday live in this palace, walking and running hundreds of meters inside this palace only to report and patrol.
Last but not least, for you who find it amusing to learn new culture, this place is very recommended by me, otherwise it's just a walk in a palace, which still nice :D"
"Nice place to go visit. Went on a weekday. Much better, as little traffic. It was a cold day, so i rushed through it. Don't expect to see a palace like those of Turkey and England. Its very much outdoor based."
"Prices are not that high and it is a nice 20 year old (rebuild) Korean palace, the secret garden tour is just nice. It is one of the biggest palaces in Korea (and next to Geongbukgong), but as all Korean palaces look somewhat similar; just go to one every once in a while or be bored. Probably the best time to visit this is in spring when the garden starts to bloom.

If you do the secret garden tours, pee when the guide says you can pee or endure."
"In time of beautiful red leaves, it is worth to visit. Not very overcrowded . Since the inner place is not open, an hour is enough."
"MRT: Exit 3 of Anguk Station (Line 3) and go straight for 5min.

You can book a city walking tour via visitseoul.net."
We visited here on a tour and really enjoyed the site. It speaks to the history of Korea. I suspect that if it was raining we would not have enjoyed it as much as we walked on a lot of sand that I guess would turn into mud when it rains.
"Second visit to seoul, and already seen geongbukgong, so I opted for this palace this round mainly for the secret garden tour. We went during the winter season, so the view was nothing spectacular. No snow. No spring flowers. It was just miles of walking, climbing up and down mountain in the cold chilly weather. Admission fee is a bit too expensive ."
"I would come back another season. As it's Winter, i could see practically see end to end. However, in Summer/Autumn, i wouldn't be able to. It amazes me at how well thought out .... only a guided tour can explain what this. Check out the timing for these tours."
I really enjoyed the tour of the Secret Garden. The grounds are very beautiful. The tour is a little hilly but most of the other grounds are quite flat.
"If you visit only one palace is Korea, this is the one it should be. Very extensive grounds with lots of decoratively painted buildings. Gates leading to courtyards, with some rooms open with furniture and model staging to give a feel of life in the palace. Shows the wealth and power that Korean rulers controlled during their reins"
"Almost all the palace in korea are similar, looks similar, only good part in this place is you get to see the change of the gaurds. However, dont expect the change of gaurds as a big scale event compare to Englands change of gaurds. And if you havent visited any palace in korea before then visiting this place is more than enough and no need to go to palace in any other parts of korea as they all looks similar. Koreans usually hype a small things alot so this is one of such category."
"One of palaces to visit esp. The Secret Garden, although with a different entrance fee. You might want to buy the combination ticket for all the 5 palaces plus the Secret Garden entrance. Much better if you visit during spring, autumn or summer."
"The palace is really really nice and in excellent conditions, the area is very big so you can spend a lot of time walking around and get immersed in the ancient korean world, especially for western people, in my opinion, is something the should never miss in a visit in Seoul.
One of the most beautiful and interesting aspect for me was the contrast from the old time looking of all the palace with his big park and the surrounding made by modern buildings and skyscraper, really singular."
"I joined the guided tour and there was only one tourist, me ^^"" Changdeokgung is a smaller palace compared to Gyeongbokgung, so if you have limited time, I suggest that you visit Gyeongbokgung first. As Changdeokgung housed the last emperor, it incorporated some contemporary elements into its buildings. Check the time for the changing of guards, and leave time to tour around the vicinity of the palace (Jeongdong). The road next to the palace wall was lovely. The coffee shop ""Daddy and me"" sold cute cookies."
"What a fantastic piece of history, restored well. Well worth a visit and if timed right look out for the ""Changing of the Guard"". Really brings history alive and can picture the king and courtiers there too. Also for the adventurous try the stewed silk worm larvae outside the main gate. Knocks the ""Bush Tucker Trial"" into a cocked hat."
"It may seem a little over-rated to be touted as the most beautiful palace out of the 4 in Seoul. 2 admission prices, one with the guided tour to the Secret Garden. I suppose the garden would be nice to tour in Spring,Summer and Autumn but if you are there in winter, don't bother paying more for the guided tour for entry into the Secret Garden. All you see is dried branches and mud and more mud."
"During a business trip to Seoul in November 2014 I was lucky enough to have a weekend to explore the best of Seoul... One of the places I decided to visit was the Palaces of Changdeokgung and Changgyeonggung. Designated a UNESCO World Heritage site since 1997.

Of the two palaces I thought that Changdeokgung was the most impressive. Completed in 1412 it's the oldest and the best kept of Seoul's palaces. The Palace impresses right from the start with the 'Donhwamun', it's huge two-tiered main gate. Once inside there is an original 600 year old granite bridge (one of the only surviving original structures) with animal faces carved into it. The 'Injeongjeon' or main throne room is rather spectacular with its golden drapes, huge red pillars and wooden throne taking centre stage. The colourful roof structure is also amazing. Not far from the throne room is the 'Huijeongdang', an impressive hall used by kings of the late Joseon period.

In short this Palace is well worth a visit and the cheap KWon 3,000 entrance fee is a small price to pay to witness this impressive piece of Korean history and stunning architecture."
"A nice stroll through the cultural history of Korea.Easy to reach as the metro is close by.
signage by each display is in Korean and English which is not often the case, especially in Asia. Well laid out, the work man ship and architecture is superb.All the palaces are worth a visit as the total area in each varies as each has its own character."
"It is one of the nice place to visit in Seoul, with lots of historical backgrounds and to understand the facts and figure, you need a good guide, so that it become more interesting to see various places in the palace. It is better to take a guided tour with a English guide as language is a great problem to communicate,Still i love South Korea."
"I admit I'm a Korean historical drama fanatic. Thus, it keeps me dreaming to come to this place someday. A dream come true to me that my hubby bring me to Korea last November until the first week of December as an anniversary gift. Although the weather that time is so cold, we explore the expansive area as much as we could. I really fell in love to the place and thinking back in times how they live their day to day life in this very large area. Of course, don't forget your cameras for your photo ops as a proof that you visited the area. There's a coffee shop near the entrance if you want to relax first after your exploration."
My wife and I found it very very interesting and well worth going. Quite reasonable priced too. We got some great photos and easily got there on the subway too
This is another palacce during the joseon dynasty and not as well kept to the first palacce .nothing csn you fancy about.
"Went here during winter, so its beautiful as the compound is all-white but still nice. But it might be too cold for some. The lady who gave us the tour is really polite and speak fluent english.

A great place to walk and take pictures. always love it that South Korea's palaces are around in the city, among the modern high rise building."
It was raining but oh well. I signed up for the tour of the gardens and it was good. It is a beautiful palace and just around the corner from Bukchon. Was there 4/13.
"We were here by Nov 2014. We joined Mandarin tour at 12:30pm. It's an only one Mandarin tour per day. The ticket for palace+secret garden cost 8000won/adult and 4000won/youth. We love Secret Garden in autumn season. The red maples are extremely beautiful. There are huts, lake and natural landscape around the garden. We felt peaceful walking slowly while enjoying beautiful scenery. Fall season is the best season to visit here. Must come!"
"The size of the grounds is amazing, Although there is not a lot a\of buildings that can be entered the architecture and the rebuilding of the temples to original specifications is magic."
Its huge ... feel very peaceful. The secret garden was closed when we went.. but the kids enjoy the scenery overall..
You haven not experienced korean culture and hisyory if u will not visit one of the many palaces in seoul. Its nice imagine how the people during the korean dynastic period must have lived in this palaces.
"Going in winters was a bad idea because the gardens were frozen with ice. We paid to see the Secret Garden tour however, at the beginning we were shown a picture of what it was looks like in the spring!"
It was nice to see part of Korea's past. We did get to see the changing of the guard ceremony which was neat as well.
"Fortunately our family arranged a private city tour. Despite being winter, the palace is indeed beautiful accompanied by the historic stories.

However it may be a little hard if youre bringing a young child (strollers) as ramp access is limited. Overall its a refreshing sight from all the shops and commercial buildings."
"The Secret Garden is located in the back of the Changdeokgung palace. You have to join a guided tour to access it, unlike the rest of the palace, that your may visit on your own. Be aware that at some time of the year, (fall especially) you will have to wake up early to join one of these tours, as the Secret Garden is one of the better place to enjoy the autumn beauty in Seoul.
You will be guided through a forest where pavilions and small structure have been set up. It is a refreshing walk in the summer heat, and while each of these structures may appear unimpressive, the way they blend with the forest and nature makes the Secret Garden unique. It is calm, composed and harmonious. I visited the place 3 times on different seasons."
"Went there in the nick of time to follow the secret garden tour (bought a combi Palace ticket with Jongmyo Shrine)

The secret garden tour is a must to see, i would say that it was actually better than the palace itself.

As usual, Palace brochures are sold at 500 won. Audio guides available as well."
"The architecture of this place is neat. Very appealing place. Specially for the Secret Garden, which needs a guided tour yes or yes, but don't worry! is provided with your entrance ticket... The problem is that the times are very limited and the English speaking group can grow a lot so you loose the main point and end with a long tour of 90 minutes with a huge crowd.

The best place to go is in autumn. No doubt."
most parts rebuilt after Japanese forces destroyed it systematically. Impression was Japanese systematically destroyed Korean identity during the occupation. Koreans are piecing together their past and culture. Sad.
"We took a quick tour of this palace but did not take the Secret Garden tour and hence cannot comment on that specifically. The palace is somewhat similar to Gyeongbokgung Palace but is worth at least a 1-2 hour visit. However, we felt that more signs could be put up along with the exhibits to explain in depth on the history of the exhibits and such."
Very well preserved palace with most beautiful garden. Loved walking in its alleys. Specifically recommend tour around the Secret Garden.
"We waited for the secret garden tour. Although I prefer to do things myself, the tour was ok; the guide was relaxed and didn't try to tell us all the nuts and bolts about absolutely everything. We were able to listen when we wanted to, and move a little ahead when we didn't. The garden gave a good idea of the life the rulers led."
The English tour for Changdeokgung and Secret Garden was excellent but a little too long. We went at the end of the autumn foliage so it was gorgeous. Definitely the best palace to visit in Seoul.
"This was our 2nd visit to the palace and the Secret Garden this year, having seen it in summer, we wanted to see how different it would look in winter. As other reviewers have mentioned, the Secret Garden tour is a must-do (additional charges apply). Buy the tickets at the main entrance and they will let you know the timings of the tour and the language spoken.

Arrive at the entrance about 5-10 minutes before the start time, as once the tour starts and the guide leaves the entrance area, you will not be allowed to join in. There will be a lot of explanation of the different buildings and parts of the garden, and what they were used for in the past. Very illuminating and gave an insight into how Korean royalty lived.

At the end of the tour, you will be near the main entrance so you can go back and see the rest of the palace if you haven't completed it yet.

If you only visit one palace in Seoul, make it this one ! Takes about 2-3 hours in total, with the Secret Garden tour."
Had a visit to this nice palace. Liked the secret garden even more - enjoyed a lovely quiet walk among the beautiful trees in the shades of fall. Good news is in the seasons u can jus walk-in on your own to the secret garden without the normal mandatory 1.5hrs guided tour...
"I went in with local friends who helped me buy the entrance fees and tickets. If you are visiting, the secret garden tour is highly recommended. It's a group tour spanning 1.5hrs and shows you the entire garden behind the palace."
"This is my second time for me to visit this palace, I visited it two years ago in the summer, its completely different in winter, more calm and more serene."
"It is a pity the whole Palace is empty so it is hard to see how the royal family would have lived within the rooms. The palace is reconstructed so is not original, however, it is a very beautiful area well laid out and spacious. The gardens must be beautiful in summer but this was difficult to tell in December."
We joined the Chinese tour group and met a very professional tour guide who speaks good Mandarin and is very humorous. It was a 60 min tour but he made effort to interact and befriend the travelers while explaining to us the beautiful architecture and culture.
Must buy tickets and join tour for the secret garden. Palace tour is not necessary if you can't meet the tour timings. You can buy the book and read along. You can spend more than 3 hours there. There is rest stops for a drink.
"You need to plan ahead, if you want to visit this palace. There is free English guided tour or the palace (check their website for the tour schedule). The tour lasted for about 1 hour. Our tour started at 10.30am. We reached the entrance at about 10.40am (we didn't know about the tour). The guard was very kind and told us about the guided tour and rushed us in, to join the group.

If you want to visit the secret garden, you need to buy the tickets separately. If I am not mistaken, they only allocate 50 tickets for online booking (per visit), with remaining 50 tickets for walk-in customer. There were only 2 English tours per day, during December. When we were there, the tickets for the 11.30am slot were sold out by 10.30am. Some customers were sadly turned away. Fortunately, we pre-booked our tickets online. If you are dead serious on visiting the Secret Garden, you are advised to pre-book the tickets.

We enjoyed the Secret Garden tour tremendously, even though the scenery was not ideal, as it is winter now, so the trees look very bare, and the lakes were frozen. This was because we had a very patient and knowledgeable tour guide, who share a lot of interesting history about each section / building in the garden, with the group. This tour may not be suitable for toddlers and senior citizens, as some of the paths are rather steep (upwards and downwards) and may be a bit tiring.

Also, do take note that the tour is very long (over 1 hour). So, if you are rushing for time, this may not work for you.

The garden is really beautiful in autumn or spring (the tour guide showed us some pictures). I might return for another visit in the right season.

A plus point of having a mandatory guided tour in here, is that the garden is never crowded and you can easily get good photo. shots of the surrounding area.

A tip in buying tickets - if you plan to visit this palace + secret garden + any other palace in Seoul, you can save some money by buying the Palace Combi ticket. You can just request for it at the ticket counter."
"Went to this place without a guide, the place was beautiful but a lot of areas were closed.
There's some walking to be done. so if you have young kids, bring a stroller."
The whole trip is a combination of your visit to the palace and the secret garden. The secret garden tour will make it more interesting but then it also requires a guided trip and a bit of time at your hand. You can although visit the place for the palace museum and the surroundings which is equally breathtaking and the views will please your eyes and mind equally
"This place is closed on Mondays so please plan ahead or check the schedules on its website before coming over. We were there in late autumn and although it was sunny, the wind was rather cruel. For some reason, there were many student tours on that day so it was quite crowded.

To enjoy this place, would suggest to go for the free guided tours. We had a lovely lady who spoke understandable English and she gave us a lot of information about the place. It was wonderful listening to her explain. This place has a few English information boards around so you can walk around by yourself if you want to.

After the Chandeokgung tour, which lasted for an hour, we continued with the Secret Garden tour. For this tour, I think that it would be best to go in Spring or early Autumn. When we got there, the was still autumn foliage but most of the trees were becoming bare. To our understanding, you can only enter this place by guided tours. However, the 'attractions' inside are not really attractive and you would be better off walking by yourself and taking pictures of the scenery. This tour lasts about an hour and a half.

For the Secret Garden tour, I would not suggest those with walking problems, with toddlers who won't walk, pushing strollers or wheelchairs because the slopes are steep and there are a fair bit of stairs to walk. There were about 20-30 people in our 120 people group stopped midway because of these slopes and stairs.

Of the palaces in Seoul, I would say this is the best one to go to. Most palaces are built the similarly but they may have different histories."
"Nice palace. It is less crowded than gyeongbukgung palace.
If u have more time, opt for Secret Garden tour. Our guide was nice & friendly. Pls be reminded, there'll be an uphill walk in the course, but only takes few mins of it."
"It was easy nice walk around the palace, although a lot of the building are closed to visitor, I can only imagine how it looks during the nice seasons (any season but winter).
There is a secret garden, however, you are only able to go in with a guided tour, the English tour option is limited, check their website before going."
"Very easily accessible from the hotel that we stayed in. Took a walk at the palace as we have few hours more before making our trip to airport back to Singapore. Love the red leaves and its so carefree to walk inside the palace, no hush and fuss. There is a small cafe right inside the Palace with inexpensive nice hot drinks. Enjoyed sitting at the cafe seeping the hot drinks we had with beautiful sunbeam casting through the beautiful autumn trees. We managed to catch the guard changing ceremony which is interesting."
Minutes away from Seoul National University Hospital and it is one of two adjoining palaces. It was good as I was doing a short stint at SNUH and needed to while away about 1-2h. I noticed alot of visitors went in a tour but there really wasnt a need to. I walked around on my own and read the signs. It was very pleasant and not rushed. You can really imagine all their royalty walking around the place in the past!
I like this palace especially the secret garden in the autumn season. I joined both palace tour and secret garden tour which give me more information to know about the palace
"Palaces and gardens are breathtakingly beautiful. You can just sit there, look around and relax and enjoy the beauty of the surroundings. Its a must to also see the Secret Garden which is only open with guided tour. If I'm not mistaken 1030 for Japanese and 1130 for English tour. We joined the Japanese tour to save time and go other places early."
"the gardens & wooden palaces & gates are beautifully serene, the long lines are annoying though so suggest to go very early in the morning; the persimmon trees when in bloom are very pretty & pcituresque; plenty of areas for those self-imposed Selfie photos!"
This place is a beautiful palace. Do note that you would need more time to walk the secret garden with a guide as well. The lady guide was very descriptive and we had a lot of fun.
"I went here mainly for the Secret Garden and it proved to be worthwhile. I am not sure how it looks like in other seasons but definitely great in autumn! Different colors of autumn leaves and the old buildings were so impressive! There are tours with different languages and I joined the English one, which was really nice. The guide speaks very good English and descriptions of the garden was lively. Highly recommend to visit here!"
The palace was picturesque. Especially the Secret Garden. we visited during winter but I feel it would be best visited in Spring.
Many Things were built by wood and due to many wars and fires there are not many historical places ( such as palaces and grand religious places like in Europe ) and I believe this place is the best that you can get in Korea. Do not expect much and if you have seen a lot you will easily understand that most of it was recently built.
This palace was reconstructed once South Korean economy started improving. It was destroyed during the Japanese occupation. The surroundings are picturesque but the palace isn't that great.
"This is my sister and I's favorite since its so close to Stay in Gam. In the outside, you think its just a simple palace but it was so amazing in the inside."
"There were so many school kids there. We had limited time at this destination, I would have liked to spend a lot more time here. Interesting culture. We missed the live performance."
Terrific parade full of colourful costumes! Then we walked back through the grounds and you can see inside the old rooms.
A must see if you visit this palace! Regimented and worth watching. Performed numerous times per day.
"The palace is spread over a huge area, you will have to spend considerable time walking around the place and enjoying each building.

Do visit in time for change of guard, the ceremony though suffers from bad make up and bit of macho over acting is a good time pass.

Next to the palace is main city center, which has embassy of different countries and shopping arcades.

There is a souvenir and coffee shop inside the complex which can be used as a pit stop after walking the complex."
This palace is the bigger of the two palaces located in Seoul. This palace has huge buildings but the highlight of my visit here was the changing of the guard in front of main palace gate. The palace guards uniforms were very colorful and it made for an excellent photo op.
"It is smaller than the nearby Geyongbokgung Palace but its more beautiful. Petite but beautiful palace.

Secret garden is only available with their inhouse tour (at additional charges) hence do check their tour timing before visiting should you like to join the tour."
Beautiful and easy to navigate. You can add it to a walking tour and see a few sites with this being a stop on your trip.
"(+) Free palace tour in various languages so be sure to check the time if you are interested to join the tour
(-) I remember a trip few years back where visitors could access the Secret Garden but now it requires a separate ticket and only accessible with a guided tour."
"We planned to visit Changdeokgung Palace because it is one of the World Heritage properties and Secret Garden (inside Changdeokgung Palace) with beautiful Autumn leaves.

There are two kinds of tickets, one is for Changdeokgung Palace only (3,000 won) & the other is Changdeokgung Palace + Secret Garden (8,000 won with tour guide). We made ticket reservation on its website 1-week before the trip, all Chinese & English speaking tour guides were fully booked, we Chinese only had to book a ""Japanese"" speaking tour guide at 12:30 pm. If you want to know every place of its history, it is highly recommended to make the reservation on its official website as early as possible for a understandable language. No advance payment is required.

Upon arrival at the Secret Garden, we were a bit disappointed because it's too early for the beautiful Autumn leaves at the end of October, not much were seen. However, the weather is nice and comfortable, it took us 2.5 - 3 hours to walk, take pictures and enjoy the environment (without following the Japanese tour guide). It is a nice & relaxing place to visit. We may learn more of Its history on its official website or UNESCO's."
"Our goal was to visit the Secret Garden to see the fall leaves, but it was a bit too early. Nevertheless, there were already some leaves that have turned to autumn colors already. I can imagine how nice it would be right smack in the middle of autumn when all the leaves would turn colors and also in Cherry Blossom season.

It was a nice walk. We got there in time for the English group and we had a park guide who showed us around. There are some steep areas and if you can't join the group, they will ask you to walk back the same way to the entrance, as a guide is required to be with you at all times. We walked through several attractions, I think they were five stops. At each stop, the guide provides an introduction and overview and gives us some time to walk around the area and take photos. We made it to the fourth stop, but there was a very steep path going down. Since we learned that they are just going to make a round and come back the same way, we decided to wait for the group and we were allowed to do so, as long as we're in line of sight of the security folks in the park.

The walk brings you out a different way, and we end up back at the main entrance of Changdeokgung Palace. So I made my way back to the palace grounds to explore the rest of the palace. It's big and spacious and since I had a short time to finish exploring the palace, I just made a quick run for the main attractions. I love the architecture. I just wish I had more time to understand the history of each area. I guess I'll just have to read up on them.

After the visit to the secret garden and the palace, we were all poofed. So we stayed at the main courtyard and found quiet a place to sit. It was actually nice sitting there with the autumn cold wind blowing our direction. We all sat in a relaxing position and had some time to check emails while we were on the road and to find a place to eat nearby. Technology sure makes it easier to explore a place as we go based on what we feel like doing next, and not always have to plan ahead. We then headed out and found Bukchon Village just a block from the palace."
"You'll need very comfortable shoes to tour the entire complex. Advisable to schedule with a tour guide because of the significance of each area of the palace, especially the Secret Garden. The palace and its grounds are not just pretty to look at and for photography shoots but knowing its history makes the photos more meaningful. You'll understand why it is listed as a World Heritage."
"The story behind each structure provides tourists and travellers the complete picture. Admiring the structure without knowing the history makes the experience incomplete.

Hire a guide."
The fee is very reasonable and this is a nice way to spend an afternoon. The details are amazing and beautiful. The garden entry is available via group tour only.
"I love this place because it's really huge and I got to get some really beautiful pictures. It amazes me that anyone would complain about this palace (I've seen some reviews) since the price is very reasonable and you can spend a lot of time here getting many different kinds of shots. One person complained about the Secret Garden's tour guide's accent. Maybe the person needs to be trained to hear different accents of English from around the world. English is not spoken in just one country. To me, that complaint was extremely ignorant and ridiculous. Another complaint was that one person had been stuck with 80-100 people during the tour. I'm not sure if this was an exaggeration or not but I saw no more than 50 when I was on my tour and I could enjoy the experience with no problem. As I mentioned before, the cost was inexpensive. The regular tour of Changdeokgung Palace is 3,000 won (60 min. at your own leisurely pace) and the Secret Garden is 5,000 won which is a 90-minute stroll with the guide taking you to various sections of the garden. It's totally worth it. Also, this place is very close to Unhyeongdong which is a very small palace nearby. It will take you 30 minutes to walk through it but it's entirely free. It's worth a look as well since you're in the neighborhood."
Another South Korean Palace that is listed in the UNESCO World Heritage. A huge place like golf course. One must be physically fit to enjoy and see the whole of the area. You can imagine how great South Korea during those days. It's worth it to visit.
"It was disappointing compared to the smaller Changgyeonggung Palace. The palace wasn't as ornate or seemed to offer much of historical significant as the one mentioned above, which is a UNESCO Heritage Site."
"We went to both the English-speaking guided tours for the general Palace and Secret Garden. We enjoyed the guided tour for the part of general Palace as the group was relatively smaller, about 25 people.

However, we did NOT enjoy the tour to the Secret Garden for 2 reasons: there were about 80 people in the tour and the tour guide spoke with an accent. The tour guide did not wait for all people to start the commentary. We missed most of the commentaries and in the end we ended up in taking the beautiful pictures of the two/ three colored Maple Leaves, so beautiful in an array of colors during the Fall.

Honestly, one tour guide cannot handle the group of 80-100, our tour to Secret Garden was simply spoilt !!!"
"We popped into this attraction as it was five minutes from our hotel and were fortunate to catch the guided tour.
While we would have liked to also see what was billed as the secret garden we did not buy the ticket for it as we were short of time.
The guide was entertaining and we'll informed, always ready to answer questions and stop for photo opportunities.
After the guided tour you may want to re-visit some areas of the palace and to read the many information boards that are provided.
Entrance fees are very reasonable and the facility is well maintained.
Well worth a visit."
"We went here in Nov 22, 2014. It was cold and drizzling, but that added more to the charm of the place. We toured the palace grounds and also joined the English tour to to palace'Secret Secret Garden. The place is so beautiful especially with the different hues of autumnn leaves."
"Sees the secret garden, only accessible as part of a guided tour. And this is, so they say, the main reason to come to the ""East palace"". If your Korean is yet to get to B1 you have to be there before 1:30 pm and there means at the entrance to the garden not the main one. Besides that the diversity of the buildings is remarkable, especially ingeneous is the floor heating system in the more modern elements."
"The palace is nice, but after visiting also Gyeongbok, they don't differ a lot. This one is smaller, but has more green (trees). Still, the concept of courtyards with palace buildings in the middle is the same.
Seems that the highlight of the visit to this palace should be its gardens (you need to buy a separate ticket for them). But both of our tries to see them failed - once we were late and the other time they said no more tickets were available (they allow a limited number of visitors, have just 2 tours in English and close quite early, so we missed even the non-English tour).
As in Gyeongbok, they also make some ramps for handicapped, but you still need help, because stone paths are uneven, there is gravel and the buildings themselves have many steps and are inaccessible. There were restrooms for handicapped."
"This rambling palace is very peaceful even with the crowds. There are a lot of buildings on the grounds but they are sparsely furnished (unlike palaces in Europe for instance). The buildings are nicely painted. Be sure to take the secret garden tour. It is guided but there is time at each of the 5 stops to look around and photograph.

I preferred this palace over the larger Geyongbokgung palace but you could enjoy a walk through Bukchon neighborhood from one to the other.

Exchange your tour ticket that came with the entrance fee at the NE gate to get a tour time."
"There is a beautiful garden to see with a guide. Very historical and enjoy walking in the garden. Even you need to make a reservation to visit the garden, but it is worth to see."
"There's lack of interior decoration in the buildings. Visitors could only imagine what happened in the palace per tour guide's description. If possible, it would be better to show the function of each building by putting in furniture used."
"Its a huge pretty place. Looks more like a Chinese palace. Understandably, you can't enter the rooms and could only look from the sides.

I liked the Prince's dorm on the right... could imagine all the girls he placed in his harem. =D

This place needs to have a souvenir center."
"I have often read that autumn is the best time to visit the Secret Garden within the Changdeokgung Palace, and so we made it a point to tour the Secret Garden again even though we just visited September last year. And it was well worth every step of the tour. The hues and colours were an absolute delight and helped me better appreciate the thoughtfulness behind the design of the garden around the natural contours of the terrain."
"Don't miss this palace, especially the secret garden. They provide walking tours in several languages. We even went to the palace at a special night event and it was charming to see everything lit."
"We toured three palaces -- Deoksu, Gyeongbok and Changdeok, and this was easily our favorite. We were there on November 9, which in Seoul is the peak for fall colors on the trees. We paid extra to see the secret garden at Changdeok and it was such a visual treat. Brilliant reds, deep reds, and different shades of orange on the maples, bright yellows on the gingkoes, mixed in with greens, ponds, and beautiful architecture. A highlight of our short stay in Seoul."
"It is interesting to explore the palace grounds and preserved buildings. Be sure to join a guided tour to understand more about it. The architecture and details on the outside are beautiful. Unfortunately in winter -when I was there- it seems they store the furniture and there are no entries allowed inside the buildings. Thanks to open structures you can nevertheless peek inside and see what the rooms look like.
If you visit in winter, be sure to dress super warm. I froze my b*tt off during the hours I was strolling around at the palace grounds. The space is quite open and the winds catch you everywhere. Brrrrr.....
Read more about it here: http://curlytraveller.com/2014/02/changdeokgung-palace-seoul.html"
"Gates open at 0900am. For just a few dollars you can spend hours here. If you want to see the Secret Garden, I suggest you get in line prior to the box office opening to obtain tickets. Many tour companies come and snatch up the tickets and you are out of luck. There are only 2 English tours a day for the secret garden, and you must join the guided tour for this area. A guided tour is not required for the rest of the palace area. The palace is located within city limits and very easy to walk to if staying in the Insadong area. A souveneir shop is within the grounds and washrooms. I was very happy with our timing coming at the beginning of November, as the autumn colours on the trees are breath taking! Dress warm if you do come this time of year as it got down to -2C at night. A lot of history to see, beautiful foliage and plenty of walking. Wooden ramps are everywhere so very wheelchair friendly if needed."
the trees compliment the structures. you can take photos with the palace as your background and off the red and yellow leaves of the trees. big place so be prepared for the long walk.
"It is really beautiful, especially in the autumn, because of leaves' colours! There lots of interesting to see include Secret Garden!"
"We arrived and realized that we had visited 6 years earlier. We paid the entry fee and went in anyway. We had the same impression that we had on our prior visit. It is impressive, but it is stark and bare, leaving too much to our limited imaginations. The last time that we visited we took a tour in English and paid the extra fee for the Secret Garden, only accessible by tour. Both were well worth the fees and time spent. This is a UNESCO World Heritage site and while we would never want it turned into a Disney version of a palace, it would be great to see an exhibit (drawings, models, film) of what all of these buildings were used for and what they may have looked like when the palace was inhabited. Next to the Secret Garden entrance was an entrance to another palace, the Changoyeonggung Palace. It was only about $1 each and it turned out to be the highlight of our day. I understand an additional fee for the Secret Garden, but would have preferred that the visit was not limited to a guided tour. I also would have liked that a brochure be offered with the entry fee or for an additional charge. There were a few plaques in English throughout, but more information and history would have been a great addition."
"Having been to the Gyeongbokgung palace the day before, this place became less appealing.The palaces are almost just the same to look at. So when you visit a palace, just visit one if you have a lot of to-go-to lists but limited time.

Too bad we missed the English tour for the Secret Garden so I cannot share what it looks like.
For the Changdeokgung Palace, it is huge and there will be a lot of people coming here. So taking one decent photo with no one in the background requires timing. In most cases, you cannot go inside the rooms as well but you can see how small those rooms are. So for those who are fond of watching korean series, you can relive some of the historical series you have watched in here.

I visited this place at the peak of autumn so the surrounding trees add to the beauty of the palaces making me envious of the people who has lived in those grounds as they witness the beauty of nature as the seasons change."
"Changedeokgung is a beautiful palace albeit much smaller than Gyeongbukgung. It was not too crowded when we visited on a Tuesday. We bought combination tickets for $10k Won each which allows one to visit the various palaces in Seoul as well as the Jongmyo Shrine. This includes the Secret Garden too. If you plan on visiting at least 2 of these attractions, it is worth buying the combination tickets.
We arrived early and were able to join the first English speaking tour for the morning. It is good to join the tour (free) as the guide will provide commentaries and information as well as historical background to the many buildings / rooms within the palace grounds. We particularly enjoyed the little snippets the guide shared with us regarding the daily lifestyle & stories of the Kings & Queens who lived there. The tour last about an hour and it ends near the entrance to the Secret Garden. This was very well planned as we could immediately make our way to the next guided tour to the Secret Garden scheduled at 1130am.
The Secret Garden tour took about 90minutes and we had a nice relaxing time there. Some portions of the gardens are quite steep but the guide always allow a short time of rest for us to recover before moving on."
"fresh air, nice view and history! It's also called ""Secret Garden"", there is no secrets hidden, but it's a place to visit and better come with your other half as it's so romantic ^^"
"Changdeokgung + Huwon (Secret Garden)
It is UNESCO Cultural Heritage. I will say buildings of palace are embraced by trees and creek. So I dare say ""It is a beauty of nature."" Also the Gyeongbokgung palace is a ""Beauty of symmetry.

Find why at this palace.

Kevin Hwang Dream."
"The only one I review - if you go to it, definitely make sure you go to take the english tour of Huwon or the secret garden. Very nice and informative - and some of the better tourist guides in Soul leading the tour."
"Secret garden is full of colors in November. The palace is huge, colorful, walls are all different. If you like to walk in nature, you will love this place."
"The palace is magnificient, beautiful and grand for ancient standards. Among the two palaces here, this is less crowded and richer in history as this is the palace that the emperor actually stayed during his terms (while the main palace was used for reception). No words can describe the character and history of the palace."
"Great tour guide, learned a lot of Korean History, beautiful time of year with leaves changing colors and Persimmons ripe on the trees."
"The secret garden is so beautiful, especially when there are the 'red leaves'. We took a lot of photos. Enjoy so much!!!!"
"This palace was biggest in seoul i can say , architecture , even colours are same in Korea . Sometimes i thought i am in same palace . Entrance is 8$ but secret garden needs another ticket."
"October is a beautiful time of year to go and visit this palace!
No more than $8 to go on a tour of the whole palace which is beyond amazing!!"
"Like the other palaces I visited during my recent trip to Seoul, I fell in live with this one too. The artistry is amazing. The architecture is amazing. When you look in, make sure you look toward the ceilings as well. The beauty doesn't stop at the walls,"
We visit secret garden with tour. It was very nice experience and a short trail to walk in the woods.
Despite of many visitors it is a nice and calm oasis - nice to walk and enjoy tranquility and see beautiful Korean architecture
"There's a palace in the not so distant grounds, Changgyeonggung. They look almost identical on the outside and you may get confused but choose this one. If you're taking the city tour, the other one is stop #22 and this is #23. Take 23. It's a much larger palace with a secret garden. .secret garden is a different fee to get in and I didn't go there but I've read that it's one of the main attractions not to be missed. This palace (grounds) is much larger with beautiful architecture."
"I love the history behind it and its vastness and serenity but it would be a lot more interesting if each of the areas there are tagged or labeled. A simple description as to what room was that or what happened in that room or what was that room used for would make it a lot more exciting to visit, especially for people like me who likes history. There are few rooms there that are described so hopefully they would do the same to the rest of the palace."
"while it is not as grandiose as Gyeongbukgung Palace (main palace), it is interesting to explore as well. Dont miss out on the Secret Garden which is more picturesque. right beside it is the Changyeongung Palace which i find more captivating because of the trees and bigger open spaces."
"The palace grounds have many buildings of all kinds which were ably explained by our guide. The buildings are used at least once a year to commemorate the dead buried at this site. The palace was constructed in 1405 by King Taejong. Although all of the palace buildings were destroyed by fire during the Japanese invasion in 1592, they were restored in 1610 and served as the main palace until 1867 when Gyeongdeokgung was built. There is a separate secret garden tour which would be lovely in the spring or summer. We went in the fall and the leaves had not changed color and there were few flowers."
"ChangDeokGung is not quite as famous as GyeongBokGung, and that makes most of its charm, as you're sure to be amazed by the palace. The only thing that ChangDeokGung does not as well as its counterpart is its lack of a front colossal palace. Other than than, ChangDeokGung has a lot of very well maintained quarters, which gives the palace a very intimate feeling. But what is truly amazing about ChangDeokGung is the secret gardens between the actual palace. Beautiful, refreshing, harmonious, it makes the stress of a metropolitan city like Seoul go away instaneously. Expect 2 hours of visit for the palace itself and close to 2 extra hours for the garden."
"The structure of the building is impressive, I think it's a smaller replica of those in Beijing palace. Quite a disappointment as there isn't anything to see inside the building, practically empty. The only portion that I'm impressed is the hanging doors which is unique to the Korean architecture. The secret garden tour is quite ok with a couple very old trees of a few hundred years old."
Book your tickets for Secret Garden first because it runs out fast. All English tours were sold out when we visited so we had to take the Japanese tour just to get in the Secret Garden. Tour the Changdeokgung Palace while waiting for your Secret Garden tour which is about 1.5 hrs.
"The largest of the 4 royal palaces and also the one which hosted the Joseon kings for the longest period. Although the premier palace of the Joseon dynasty was the Gyeongbokgung palace, it was destroyed after Japanese invasion 1600s and was not rebuilt until late 19th century. Hence Changdeokgung served as the premier palace during this period. Changdeokgung is very large and interesting but visiting it without visiting its rear garden, Huwon (a.k.a. Secret Garden) would be a mistake. Huwon is very large with trees, beautiful ponds and pavilions. For adults, admission fee for Changdeokgung is 3000 KRW and Huwon is 5000 KRW. But if you buy a combined ticket for royal palaces which is valid for 1 month you will pay 10000 KRW and with this ticjket you will be able to visit Changdeokgung, Huwon, Changyeonggung, Gyeongbokgung, Deoksugung and Jongmyo Shrine. A very good deal if you have a few days in Seoul."
"I had pre-booked my Huwon (Secret Garden) Tour online and I would recommend visitors to do so. Although you will still have to queue to retrieve your tickets, at least you are guaranteed for the tour, in your preferred language (and you will be aware of the relevant time slots too). The land area is massive and there is much to explore in Changdeokgung Palace even without the Huwon; however, I reckon one might get bored easily without a guide. One positive thing to note is that due to its size, I didn't feel that it was too crowded although there were many visitors (even local groups bringing their children along for study trips).

The Huwon tour though is definitely my highlight to Changdeokgung Palace. The Huwon harmonises with its natural terrains as its pavilions and gardens are built on slopes and around its large hills. Hence, most of these beauties are hidden from sight, if you are not following the tour. On the other hand, the route may be difficult as there is some hiking involved (just a tough on the elderly) and the tour would be almost impossible for those bound on wheelchair as maneuvering around it gets really tricky. Be prepared, with a good pair of walking shoes."
"This is an interesting palace & looked to me to be a lot like palaces you see in China. You don't need to spend hours & hours here, but it is worth a visit. But if you do come here, make sure you go to the secret garden. You can only gain access on a tour, but you don't have to stay with the tour. Just wander around & admire it by yourself if you aren't so interested in the history & dates. The garden represents 2/3rds of the palace grounds & you can comfortably see them in about an hour to an hour & a half."
"As the palace was fired and damaged and rebuilt, a few touch wasn't done properly (you would see the cement between roof tiles) but it's generally kept well. They have many language tours (English, Chinese, Korean), so quite convenient.

They include palace and garden which is 2/3 area, the whole tour takes about 2.5hrs, then you should go along the Insa-dong street with a lot of souvernir shop and restaurants. Insa-dong street used to be living area of the high rank officers in the monarchy, so you can find authentic korean food there.

Visitors will get free admission to the palace ($3000 won) on the last Wednesday of the month but it doesn't apply to the Secret Garden ($5000 won). It's very closed to Anguk station, so very convenient."
Arrived in time to join the secret garden afternoon tour. Interesting and informative with your guide. Walking uphill on some parts of the tour was tiring. Wear good shoes!
"The architecture of this palace is amazing and the location of this palace among the historic mountains andf tasteful surroundings alone make for an interesting visit. The artwork and brilliant carvings make this very special. If you are lucky enough to have a wonderful guide to explain its intricacies and to regale you with the wonderful stories connected with this palace, you surely will never forget your visit."
"I was told that the palaces looked similar after visiting a couple so I decided to just go for this UNESCO heritage site. Book early to ensure you get tickets to the Secret Garden (which are by tour only), these gardens take up 2/3 of the palace grounds and are quite lovely for an easy stroll and plenty of photo-taking opportunities. If you do not get a ticket for the Secret Garden, then turn up ard 9am on the same day and get the remaining tickets there."
"I opted to go on the tour of the secret garden that is part of Changdeokgung, and I enjoyed it. The tour guide was good at English, and it was really interesting to learn the history behind it all during the tour. I do have to warn you that there is A LOT of walking in the tour, so go prepared!"
"Must visit. Although a bit jaded from my visit to the Forbidden City and the Summer Palace in Beijing during the same trip, it was still impressive and beautiful."
"This was our first visit. After touring on our own the two Palaces, we were booked for the Secret Garden tour in English at 11.30am. Feeling hungry and knowing the tour wont end till 1pm, we looked high and low for places within the Palace that sells food.

Finally found a cafe but realized the cafe only served drinks. We quickly exited the Palace so that we could eat some waffles bought from a stall just outside the Palace.

So be forewarned that if your visit stretches beyond your meal time ...exit the Palace to grab a quick bite (the officer would tie a wrist band on your hand so you could re-enter the Palace again).

Thought the authorities are too strict on a no food policy within the Palace!"
"I always enjoy the tremendous beauty and harmony of this palace. This is one of the five main palaces in Seoul, known as ""Five Grand Palaces"" that are built by the ancient Joseon Dynasty. Gyeongbok Palace is the largest and the most famous royal palace, and the symbol of ""Shining Happiness"". And I always take a bit of that happiness back home when I come here. This is a good experience!"
"Quite a disappointing visit to the highly talked about secret garden.
Restricted visit to secret garden with only entries with tour and not allowed free roaming.
No flowers and ponds are not maintained. Streams were dry and required own imagination of audio support.
Uphill and downhill slopes and steps can be challenging as tour guide walked speedily.
Shoes only"
We picked the tour that included the Secret Garden. Definitely worth the visit. The guide gave excellent explanations in good English.
"Such an interesting place to see. We had a tour there but decided to go it alone as it was in Korean. This said it was easy to get around and beautiful to see, make sure you get there early as some parts of the palace and gardens are closed off after five and wear comfortable shoes as it is a lot of walking."
"A mini-Forbidden City. Well worth the visit, especially to the adjacent Folk Museum. And, not that far from the hotel."
"Originally constructed between 1405 and 1412, it was Korea's centre of power. It contains Seoul's oldest stone bridge along with a throne hall, royal office and a wonderful secret garden. Catch the Changing of the guard at 2pm each day except Mondays when I believe the Palace is closed."
"Loved the authenticity of Changdeokgong Palace. Beautiful grounds and well-preserved architecture. But do note that the Secret Garden Tour is quite hilly. My mother had problems with the slopes and steps (weak knees) but it has a serene and beautiful park-like atmosphere. Ladies, wear heels at your own peril!

Also, although there are ramps in place, the palaces are not really wheelchair friendly."
"There are lots of palaces in Seoul but this is probably the best. It's a good idea to go early to try to minimize the crowds. Unfortunately, like most of the palaces, it is largely a recreation thanks to the Japanese occupation and the occasional fire. The elements near and on the water are my favorites. It's worth spending 3000 won for the audio tour guide. If you can try to see on of the King's inspection shows."
"We chose to visit Changdeokgung Palace (a UNESCO World Heritage site) instead of the majestic Gyeongbokgung Palace as we read it was a palace closer to nature as compared to the grandeur of the latter palace. True enough, the atmosphere of the surrounding areas were of peace and tranquility even with visitors (locals and tourists) streaming into the grounds. We had booked the Secret Garden tour online which gave us access to the larger grounds behind the main buildings of the palace. A very calming visit as compared to the hustle and bustle of busy Seoul."
"do not miss the secret garden tour. the garden is marvellous and you'll need to book the tour. you can book it before you arrive online, or try your luck at the ticket booth when you arrive."
Very interesting and well maintained historical palace. We enjoyed seeing the changing of the guards.
"Beautiful palaces and gardens. Also very good to visit with children, because they can run around and there is no traffic to worry about. Make sure to buy your tickets (online) for the Secret Garden before you go, as this gets sold out pretty quickly."
"N37°34.955' E126°59.606' If you only have time to visit one of Seoul’s five major palace complexes, make this UNESCO World Heritage property your choice. Changdeokgung (meaning Palace of Illustrious Virtue) was originally built in the early 15th century as a secondary palace to Gyeongbukgung. Following the destruction of both palaces during the Japanese invasion in the 1590s, Changdeokgung was rebuilt and became the primary royal residence until 1872. It remained in use by members of the royal family well into the 20th century.

During our visit in August 2014, the palace compound was opened for the public, but for visiting the Huwon (Secret Garden) – a must – we made reservations beforehand through their excellent website, because their guided tours are restricted to 50 people at a time. On the time of our visit, the ticket office did not ask for our reservation at all.

The tour starts in the palace compound beyond the palace. It takes 10 minutes to reach the gate. We found the secret garden amazing: beautiful scenery of temples, ponds and gardens. Not to be missed."
"This place is great, it is well preserved, and the entry fee is cheap.
Don't miss the english tour guide, she gaves us a better insight of what each building represents.
The parade was nice. The place was not too crowded as we went on a weekday."
"3000W each to enter and English tour (only 1 at 2.30pm). No English maps etc. We have visited many temples in Korea - Busan, Sockcho etc. This was uninspiring. Too much dust and open space, some pleasant vistas but the backdrop of hi-rise is a real annoyance. Very tricky to get real quality photos here. I had to focus on close-ups. Very average for the price...."
There are english speaking tours on offer at this temple which was great. The temple has an interesting history and secret gardens.
"Really gotta give it to Koreans for this well-preserved palace. The redone paint is just about the right amount to keep it antique and not shabby for looking. The palace was home to imperial family and court ladies but it served as the main palace in the late era of the Choson dynasty.
There are a lot of birds on the ground, look out for drops!"
We went there twice. It was their National Holiday and full of life and excitement and best of all if you are over 60 (or is it 65) you can get in for free. A must see and splendid to walk around. If you see Korean's dressed in Hanbok (their national dresses) they do not seem to mind being photographed at all. It was a wonderful two days spent there.
"Its worth a visit to the Changdeokgung Palace when you are in Seoul. Its not crowded with tourists, its surrounding is peaceful and quiet and it has a nice garden which you should visit. Its called the ""The Secret Garden"". There is a guide which will bring you around the garden, explaining the history. The tour will take around 1.5 hours and it cost KRW5000. Make sure you tour the palace and the Secret Garden when you visit this place of interest. It will take approx 2.5 to 3 hours if you do the palace and garden guided tours."
"One of the places you should see while in Seoul. However, unless you have a few days in Seoul, if you've seen one palace, you've kind of seen them all."
"The palace is a very nice place, and with much less people than the major palace in Seoul.
Some of the buildings and gates are original and dating from early 15 century. 1 hour to 90 min should be ok for a good visit.
The tickets are cheap, as all the major attractions in Seoul, for this one for example the entrance is around USD3"
"Palaces on Seoul were built in pairs, so this is one of the oldest Palaces that was built as the twin of Gyeonghuigung. It is interesting to watch how the European architecture blend with the oriental one, in the leisure pavillion for example. Also in October the European style part of the Palace will open as a museum."
This place was good to see. However the place itself seems to have been repainted and it does not look real. The colours were too bright and the bricks were perfect. It didnt have that historic feel to it. They may have furbished it but just wasnt the same.
"Breathtaking palace! I saw many palaces and parks and wasn't impressed by Korean architecture before. But this palace chAnged my opinion! Not monumental, but amazing! Not world famous but very unique !"
"I was amazed at how large the palace grounds were. Through every gate another expanse appeared. Beautiful architecture, lovely views plus the contrast between the ancient and the modern as you view Seoul's skyscrapers in the same frame as the palace. Plan to walk a lot! Highly recommend."
Or maybe I have seen too many palaces. We did the English tours of palace and garden. I wish the guide had not made it seem so much like work for her and for us. But it was ok. Just not great.
The buildings here were so well preserved. It was like they were just built. It was so big we weren't able to see everything. The garden tour was really nice too.
Beautiful architecture. Like stepping back in time. Strolling through the gardens so serene and peaceful. A must during any visit to Seoul.
"You can see the Palace from the Far, there is a great wide avenue/boulevard leading to it. It takes your breath away even from the far.

It gets even more impressive as you get closer and see all the intricate details of the carving. And then you are blown away by the news that what you see here is only a small portion of what the actual area of the castle property is.

We were extremely lucky as without planning it we got to see the change of the guards by the front gate. Makes you feel a part of that era for a few minutes.

It is very important to try and understand at least a tiny bit of the country's culture, and this is the perfect place for it.

Plan your trip here in the morning or towards the evening, as it can get extremely hot around lunchtime. That is of course if you are visiting Seoul in spring or summer."
There was a play happening at the same time we visited. It gave us an insight on how the days were lived during the days of an emperor. There are locker services available but the toilet is quite a walk from the main entrance!
"I am expecting it to be the usual well tended garden but its not. It is a hiking trail in a hill with forest trees, small pavilions and lotus ponds. This secret garden was intended as a place for the royal family to relax and for the early Joseon kings to have his military exercise and archery contests.

A natural and authentic historic place to visit. It is compulsory to join their free guided tour. Do check out their website for the guide timing, http:http://eng.cdg.go.kr/guide/guide_cost_01.htm"
"We visited Gyeongbokgung before visiting Changdeokgung, and we like the layout of Changdeokgung more. There was a royal cuisine event and actors demonstrating the meal time ritual of the emperor, which was interesting and was a nice touch. However, the secret garden was a let-down, but I did have a good workout walking through it."
"Beautifully kept grand palace located in Jongno-gu, Seoul. The palace itself is superb but the best part is the Secret Garden hidden behind its walls.
The garden was used by the royalty to take summer leisurely strolls and it has dozens of quaint buildings hidden within nature.
Take one of the English guided tours (book ahead on their website) and get a sense of the calm and beauty that occupy the 72 acre area.
This Joseon Dinasty palace was one of the highlights of our trip to Seoul."
We came early and I recommend you do the same. The palace is beautiful and the guides are good at making sense of it all. The secret garden was really outstanding and a must go. Tip: Get the combined ticket that includes the secret garden and several other palaces. It saves you a lot of money if you are planning to go to at least a few of them.
"The palace is beautiful and the garden was also very nice. The architecture feels like a blend of Chinese and Japanese style. The palace ground is actually very large, so allocate about 1 hour minimum to see everything. We took the Secret Garden tour to see the back gardens and it was worth the 1.5 hour walk. The walk was peaceful and the English guide was entertaining, but I think it would be a little too taxing for the elderly given the slopes and the summer heat. In comparison to Gyeongbukgong, there are some similarities in architecture, but this palace feels more genuine. The skyline of the palace is very interesting, as it is right in the middle of a modern city against tall glass buildings. :-) A must-see place for first time visitors to Seoul."
"This is one of the best tourist spot Ive been, a definite must visit when you are in Seoul. When you visit this place, make sure you go to the free tour at the Huwon."
"Changdeokgung Palace is one of the spots I like and show off to foreign travelers as a Korean. Huwon, the rear garden, was designated as a World Cultural Heritage by UNESCO. I am very proud of it and it is worth visiting here. You can feel the natural beauty itself fully."
I visited the palace on a weekday and found that it was much less crowded than the Gyeongbokgung Palace which was nice since this allowed for time to stroll around and take pictures. The whole complex was very beautiful and it was really interesting to see the original-type architecture of Seoul. I didn't do the Secret Garden tour but found that I really enjoyed the palace regardless. Definitely worth the admission price and there are brochures and information boards throughout so you get an understanding of which buildings were used for different purposes.
"We came on a weekday and luckily bought back to back palace and garden tours. Being a unesco site the beauty and history of the place will be obvious very quickly. The guides are very professional, sometimes funny, and it was $8 a great value. You will need good shoes, the guides accommodate for all abilities and advise appropriately for strenuous segments of the secret garden tour."
"You can visit it now with an entrance fee aside from that needed to enter the palace itself. Though every last Wednesday of the month the palace entrance is free. I have been inside the Deoksugung Palace which is closest to the town center, Changdeokgung is much bigger and with an English tourist guide (scheduled), I had a better appreciation of the history of the palace i.e the history of rooms, space, engravings etc. My group wanted to have our own free walk in the Secret Garden because we were short of time but we were not allowed too – seems that visitors have to follow the guide once inside the garden. It is quite huge, to make sure the queen was not bored or/and having a feeling of melancholy being forbidden to step outside of the palace. Almost like being outside, it’d be more beautiful in the fall or winter."
"This great palace is situated in a beautiful garden, it is large and shows how power was executed centuries ago. Very well restyored after the Korean War"
"if you wanna visit the palace and the secret garden you will pay 8.000 won (around 8 usd). the visit of the secret garden lasts 1,5 hour and i guess it's quite worth. you can step back in the past and you enter the green heart of a huge city as seoul. i recommend the visit"
"I was expecting good of this palace. The facilities are amazing, It makes you feel like you;re back on the old times. I love how they had keep it. Totally worth it and the price as well, Good places to show also."
"I have not seen Changdeokgung in the daytime, so this review is strictly about the Moonlight Tour. I was looking forward to the tour with great anticipation, as it is only offered to foreigners six nights a year, with a limit of 100 tickets per night. I made a special point to be online and order tickets the minute they went on sale, that's how much I wanted to take this tour.

The tour was offered in English, Chinese, and Japanese, and attendees were divided into groups accordingly. That part was good. I expected the pathways, buildings and garden to be illuminated (not brightly so as to recreate daytime, but at least so that we could see what we were being shown) but sadly, this was not the case. A small number of attendees were asked to carry paper lanterns as we walked the grounds, and there were a few lights on the buildings, but I couldn't really see much. The pathways were unlit (the few paper lanterns scattered about were ineffective), and the ground is quite uneven, with random obstacles on the path (something which looked like pipe vents, at one point there was something that looked like an empty concrete pond, completely unlit, which someone could easily have tripped into), and we were marched from building to building very quickly. There was a lot of hiking up stairs and then down stairs, all stone, all uneven, all unlit. What could have been a pleasant walking tour felt more like a march in the dark. We were ""treated"" to a tour of the rear ""secret"" garden but were unable to see anything - I mean absolutely nothing. So what was the point of taking us through the garden? I'm still not sure.

When we reached the pavilion at the end of the garden, there was one building which was beautifully lit, with a large (unlit) pond in front of it. A musician played a traditional Korean gayageum, and we got to sit and listen for about 10 minutes. This part of the tour was quite lovely.

Tea and traditional Korean sweets were part of the tour, but the tea was served in paper cups - take one as you walk past a table, and keep moving - and the sweets were handed to you in a (very nice) fabric bag. I didn't expect a formal tea ceremony, but I also didn't expect a paper cup. This was just one more disappointment.

From there we sat as an audience in front of a stage area, where we were treated to another lovely musical performance consisting of several different types of performances. This was the highlight of the tour. If this had not been included, my rating would have been ""poor"" rather than ""average."" After that, we had to walk about 15 minutes back to the entrance, with no guidance, minimal lighting, and, once again, hidden obstacles.

Cost: 30,000 won per person. I would not recommend it. Go in the daytime, walk at your own pace, and you will undoubtedly get much more enjoyment for much less money."
I personally like this place more than Gyeongbokgung as it's less crowded. Walk around slowly and take some nice pictures.
I went to the 10.30am tour and so glad I did. I learnt a lot and the guide was amazing in traditional dress. Can definitely recommend (and very cheap to enter with the tour for free!). I didn't do the secret garden but I heard that's beautiful too.
"We went here for the Huwon Tour last cherry blossom. It's like going back in time and seeing what it's like in the past.
History and Nature sighseeing is a great combination.
Relaxing place inspite of the long walks...."
"It's a beautiful palace with a beautiful garden called
Secret garden. Not as big as KyungBok Palace but more charming n it is really pretty in the spring. In the fall, the colors of the trees n the fallen leaves will take your breath away."
"While living in Korea, we traveled to and visited many sights. The palaces located in Seoul make it easy to travel a short distance to be transported back in time when emperors ruled. This one is beautiful in many season but can be challenging for those with physical impairments due the change in elevation grades and types of pathways. And the admission cost is perfect for me as I'm a shoestring-budget tourist, by choice.

If you have time before visiting, find The Sword with No Name on Netflix and you will learn the story behind Japan murdering the Korean Empress at this palace. (Some characters are fictional but story is accurate)."
This is a great place to see some of the history of Korea. They have preserved the site perfectly. Great photo ops.
Look I have to start with a disclaimer and say that old palaces and the like tend not to be too much of my thing. That said I did enjoy the trip here and really do recommend taking the time to make your way here if you are in Seoul. The guides are really very knowledgeable and the gardens within the grounds of the palace are well worth checking out. If not for any other reason that you are in a busy and bustling city yet are in what is really a quite secluded and serene garden and nature walk. I suppose it is the juxtaposition that is most striking about it.
"Its a beautiful palace with a huge amount of grounds and wasn't overly crowded. I have to say despite its beauty I did find it a little bit samey in design/architecture without much variation from the style. Its worth a visit, and get a guide if you can because its very thorough and informative. Takes about 1-2 hours to look around. There is access to the 'secret garden' but it costs more so we didn't go. Try and go when its sunny as the colours on the buildings are better! Near to Insadong and other palaces/temples. This is easy to find (its huge) and is about 10-15 minutes away from various metro stations."
"Did Changdeokgung Palace as part of a day doing several palaces. Arrived late afternoon and I was surprised how few people were there.

We missed the changing of the guards but still enjoyed our visit. I really liked this site and we spent a very pleasant couple of hours here. Well worth as visit."
"i love, love this place . It's an amazing palace that is very well maintained. visit the secret garden its beautiful."
"This was the first palace we visited because it is a UNESCO world heritage sight. We paid US$7 to get in. I was surprised to find very few visitors in the place. I would have thought this was the most popular palace in the city but, apparently, it is not. Maybe it was because of the weather too. It was drizzling on and off.

The grounds of this palace is not that large so we were able to see everything without tiring ourselves. There was a free tour and although we did not join we were also able to ask the tour guide some questions. Most rooms are accessible/visible which is a good thing; visitors can take photos of the insides of most structures. My favorite place there was the structure near the secret garden that the tour guide said housed the last royal family of Korea.

We did not go to the other areas that required a separate entrance fee."
"Be sure to see the changing of the guards on the hour between 10am to 4pm (could be 6pm). It is quite a sight to behold, the palace is quite majestic but it has become very touristy for those that do not enjoy sheer numbers of tourists"
"My wife and I planned on taking in the entire palace, but after the Secret Garden, we were just too tired and it was starting to rain. If you do take in the Garden, plan on 90 minutes. The walk consists of hills and small lakes/ponds in the area. It is worth the time, I plan to go back and take in the palace."
"It's an amazing palace that is very well maintained. If you visit in the morning, most of the other visitors haven't gotten up yet. I also recommend the tour of the Secret Garden, even with the additional fee. You can take a tour of the palace, but the signage is so comprehensive, we didn't feel the need of the tour."
"This is the temple you need to visit while in Seoul. It is really big and you can spend hours there just walking around looking at the amazing houses. So different from our ""western"" styles of architectures, so its nice to see how it looks like inside of the temples."
"It is one of the temples you MUST see in Seoul. The place is huge and you could spend a whole day inside. There are many different temples, parks and ponts and you can walk inside for hours. It is always crowded though. Come during the week not at the weekend or on holidays!"
"the palaces in this area all look the same, and they all look chinese... i thought i was in korea? just kidding... but if you've been to the marvelous palaces in japan or china, these ones in seoul can't compare. just go to gyeongbokgung and spare yourself the other ones"
"It was nice, however the buildings were very similar.
We paid for out for single tickets to go round this, without realising if you are looking to do all of the palace in Seoul then you can get a ticket which allows you access to all for 10,000KRW (£5.50 ish), which we later got. This was my least favourite of the ones that we visited. Very busy and crowed.
We didn't attach ourselves to a tour at first as we thought we would be able to have a look round, but half way round we caught up with the English tour and carried on going with them. The tour guide was very informative and spoke really good english. I would advise going with a tour guide, or you will not understand what everything means!"
"Having recently been to china and japan I'm a bit spoiled when it comes to temples, shrines and palaces. The one Seoul is really nice and larger and well worth a visit. It is however not as breathtaking than other, similar places in Asia."
"very beautiful place. you can stay here for half day, have a picnic, or just walk around ancient buildings and small houses, there is also many beautiful places to relax, to sit and enjoy beautiful view."
Beautiful place to relax and enjoy the nature and history! Also! When you will come at last wednesday of the month you will enter for free~ !
"We may fell the ancient ambience, starting the guard ceremony at the gate. the palace are so big area and you may walk as an exercise. The palace a bit empty inside. They should have human image with traditional cloth ."
"It is definitely a must-see when you are in Seoul. It is a UNESCO world-heritage and provides you with a good Impression of the Korean heritage. Make sure you also get to the see the secret garden, you need an extra ticket for it and tickets are limited per day as you need to be part of an official tour."
"Visited this place with my wife and 11 year old son. Cost us around 30,000 Won for all three to visit the palace and grounds and the Secret Garden which is only accessible by taking a tour and paying an extra fee. The guide mentioned they were doing extensive restorations and had not nearly finished. Thus explained the run down appearance of most of the buildings and the algae filled ponds inside the secret garden. This place is on the UNESCO World Heritage list of historic places which makes you want to visit. Then you realize there are 1007 places in the world on this list. In any event I am not sorry we went as it does represent a historic period in the history of Korea. The day we went it was over 90 degrees F or about 33 degrees C. Very humid as well. The secret garden tour was longer than it needed to be but with so many people and some hilly terrain understandable. The location is about 300 meters from the metro station so it is convenient. If you are in Seoul it is worth a visit but don't expect to be awed."
"Coming here via subway is easy and convenient. Stepping into the compound is like watching a Korean drama coming to live except for the missing actors and actresses. There are lots of self explanatory boards about each hall and room. If you want to go to the secret garden, you have to pay additional fee."
"It is very big and traditional, a must see if travelling to Seoul. We had a guide and he told us many things, he was booked through Kim's travel."
"We just came to Korea from Japan and agree with a previous poster's sentiments. We did find the palace and gardens very underwhelming because of two reasons. The first being that the garden didn't appear to well kempt with algae covered ponds and paint peeling all over. It wasn't a place of beauty. It was nice enough. On top of that there were too many rest points for people who may be tired. This meant a 45 minute tour became a 90 minute one.

I recommend that you get the combination ticket if you visit another palace in addition to here. It costs 10,000won. You have to join a tour to go to the secret garden. We booked on the tour an hour beforehand. The tour group is very large. There are also palace tours, which may have added information and context to the palace.

Ultimately, for us it was underwhelming so adjust expectations if coming from Japan. That said for a few pounds or dollars you get to wander around a place of history."
"One of the many palace in Seoul. Changgyeonggung is just next to it, and connected (but separate admission fee)

More in my blog: http://photofreak-alvinz.blogspot.sg/2013/02/korea-trip-25-jan-4-feb-2013.html"
Large palace and grounds which give time to reflect on what came before the modern high-rises and efficient metro. Well preserved and representative of Korean palace architecture.
Having visited several palaces in Japan - we found this one underwhelming. You really are not allowed in anywhere - and there are not a lot of furnishings. We did the secret garden tour - which does not live up to the hype. It's just a bunch of pavilions - and waiting for the group to catch up.
The palaces in Seoul are very beautiful and colorful. We paid our admission and also paid for the tour of the secret garden. The garden tour was very long but very scenic. Had pictures taken with girls dressed in traditional Hanboks. there is alot to see here and alot of pictures to be taken.
You will learn more about the history of the palace and the royal families if you take the tour which is included with admission. There are 2 English tours daily. The guide was pleasant and knowledgeable. You need to purchase a separate ticket to visit the Secret Garden. You should also go on a tour to gain a better understanding of how the garden was used. You should wear comfortable walking shoes and bring water and perhaps a hat during a summer visit.
"The palace itself is interesting, but lack of any identification of what the buildings were or their significance to the historical period has you looking at a lot of buildings that all look very similar. Once you've seen one or two, you've seen them all. The Secret Garden is also interesting, but it too has many of the same structures without much difference in their historical value. It was interesting but not worth 90 minutes. Guided tour is large group with single guide, you can easily miss our out the naration."
"4 palaces of Seoul = Must visit
Secret garden of this palace is magnificant too.

You can feel the true beauty of Seoul and modesty of Korean ancient kingdom.
Highly recommended."
"Another must-see when you visit Seoul. You must join a guided tour (not so many) but if you don't care about the commentary, you may as well join a Korean tours (every hour). Make sure to visit the Secret Garden (a dense woodland). You can buy a cumulative ticket for the 5 Palaces of Seoul."
"Really enjoyed walking the grounds, seeing the change of the guard and reading about an incredible part of History. The grounds are quite vast so be sure to wear comfortable shoes. Walk the gardens, go in and out of the buildings. Bathrooms are located in the museum in the center of the attraction. Really good coffee shop in there too."
Just Wow to a different culture. I liked an architecture there and there is a lot of space to just walk and rest
"This palace visit was worth seeing. We used a tour guide that did not speak English very well but my cousin said this is not usual. The information he provided was helpful in understanding the nuances of the palace. One of the palace exits lead to a view of the Capital building.

Hint: Bring an umbrella on hot days as it can be very hot and will take a few hours to view the palace and grounds."
"Excellent, very much worth a visit, if you are interested in Korea's ancient history. Ground can be a bit uneven so watch your step, very good."
"We joined the english guided tour to visit the secret garden. The tour was 1,5 h and the guide was good at english and told lot's of interesting stories about the palace and its former inhabitants. You should wear good walking shoes, which I didn't because sometimes the path is a bit rough. There is only one possiblitity to buy water and visit the toilet during the tuor and its just in the beginning so be aware of that."
"Are you wondering whether you should pay the extra 5000 won to visit the Secret Garden? The answer is yes. The English guided tour is 1.5 hours - our guide was friendly and spoke good English. Thing about guided tours is they point things out to you that you wouldn't have known or noticed otherwise. You can't get into the Garden without a tour anyway. The rest of the palace is pretty, or at least a lot prettier and shadier than Gyeongbokgung palace."
"The palace is huge and peaceful. Try to get there as early as you can, it would be a great place to slowly relax and walk around with no one to bother you. You can apply for an English tour guide to bring you around and explain."
"I have visited most of the Seoul palaces, and in my opinion Changdeokgung is the best one
Only problem:
In the other palaces of Seoul you can walk by yourself and take your time
Here you have to wait an go in only with the guide and other tourists"
"This palace was amazing. The changing of the guard is worth watching, the marching band announcing the change. The grounds were fun to explore, the buildings beautiful and colorful. It is a great cultural spot to visit if you want to get the true Korean experience."
The palace shows traditional korean architecture and is built in harmony with the landscape. It should be visited if you are interested in traditional culture and local history.
"No doubt this is one of the most beautiful city's attractions the Changdeokgung Palace is always open and follows the opening hours from about 9 am to 5.30 pm. This is spread on an huge immense area, I think the correct running time visit it's at least about 3 hours - to visit the entire area, this is divided into two parts, the royal palace with many other small huoses and Secret Gardens. The Secret Gardens has an extra charge if you would like to visit it requires to book a guide included in the price, this guide gathers together about 50 people at a time in a specific location and you can not wander around the gardens without a guide.
Experience unforgettable"
"Not all palaces in Seoul are the same. This one is really well-maintained and there is an app to help you navigate around the palace. Better still, wait for the English tour guide to bring you around. Greatly recommend the place."
"We went on a guided English tour to the palace secret garden and was amazed by the beautiful structure and stories of each areas. The guided tour was very patient and friendly in explaining every details to us.
The place was soo huge that we did not have enough time to explore every areas. The nature in the palace makes you feel at ease and it actually makes you feel like you were back in the jo seon dynasty if theres a hanbok to wear haha.
If you like exploring historical buildings and stories, Changdeokgung Palace is amust place to visit in your korea trip list."
Changdeokgung’s rear garden. There are some of the many pavilions and fountains that occupy the garden. The most beautiful time to see the garden is during the fall when the autumn foliage is at its peak and the leaves have just started to fall.
"beautiful wooden building and beautiful garden surrounding, very uniquely place.
one of which includes UNESCO world heritage"
"I went in the morning so it was very empty to begin with, I could take my time and I enjoyed the luxury of fewer people in all my photos. Interesting if you've never experienced Asian palaces before, architecture is beautiful and stories and interesting."
Very nice place to go in Seoul. Impressing buildings and you will like this place. It´not to overcrowded even at the weekends.
"We made sure to research online and pop by the palace at a timing when there were free English tours given. The tourguide's English was understandable and I believe we had a rather interesting time there.

Nonetheless, it has been a year since I last went (late review is late), and I can safely tell you that I recall nothing from my trip to the palace other than the fact I've been there. So, I suppose while it made for an interesting stop, it wasn't memorable.

Drop by the palace if you have time, and if you really want to be able to cross it off your list. If not, I believe there can be better ways for you to enjoy your trip in Seoul."
The palace area is quite extensive and we enjoyed the changing of the guard ceremony and the peaceful lake surrounds.
"Palace was similar to Gyeongbukgung Palace, with the addition of Biwon, also known as Secret Garden. Secret Garden was overrated and the sights was the same throughout the garden- pagodas and ponds everywhere"
"Not far from the Australian embassy, this palace is huge! Don't miss the changing of the guard ceremony - highly entertaining and different to any other guard changing you will ever see! I'd recommend a guided tour to appreciate the history of the palace and get a better understanding of its uses over time."
"Highly recommend the tour of the Secret Garden but due to the timing of the tours, please be prepared for hot weather and a tan. Wear comfortable shoes and for walk on sandy hill/ grounds. Bring along water to hydrate.

As the tour might be tire, tour palace grounds before the tour."
"This the cream of the crop of the 5 Korea palaces not least because it was awarded World Heritage status in 1997. It was actually a visit of two halves .... the Palace buildings and then the large ""secret"" gardens located at the back. Both of which require entry fees. Walk in via the oldest still standing bridge in Seoul to enjoy many palace buildings which seemed very authentic despite some major rebuilding. Then the gardens - delightful - glad we commoners can now go in!"
"This was one of the better palaces we’ve visited in east asia. I highly recommend the guided tour through the secret garden (Huwon). The secret garden was the highlight of our visit to Changdeokgung and was well worth the additional entrance fee. The secret garden is created with minimal alterations to the surrounding woods which gives it a unique natural feel. The tour lasts 1.5 hours. You will be required to walk up a few slopes during the tour. So if you happen to visit in summer on a sunny day like we did, be prepared for a little perspiration or perhaps avoid the midday tours.

Outside the secret garden, I personally didn’t find the palace buildings too interesting. Having already seen the Forbidden City and summer palace in Beijing, I found Changdeokgung to be quite similar in terms of architecture and layout of the palace buildings. Of course, there will be subtle differences between Korean and Chinese palaces. As with many east asian non-functional palaces, you only get to walk on the outside for the most part. There are very few indoor exhibits to illustrate what the inside of the palace would have looked like in its heyday. However I would still recommend visiting this palace if you are interested in asian architecture. The palace buildings are decorated with intricate designs that shouldn’t be overlooked."
I would say this palace is a must visit. It beats the main touristy palace. It's situated in beautiful grounds...be sure to visit the secret gardens...it's quiet and one of the most beautiful palaces I have seen on earth.
"This palace is a partial reconstruction. Much of the original was destroyed during the Japanese occupation and by fire. It is enormous, and you get a sense of the wealth that must of have been concentrated in the hands of the rulers. However, you view the buildings only from the outside, sometimes through open but roped off doors. The original furnishings were carted off long ago. The best part of the property is the garden which requires a separate ticket. There are an interesting range more and less formal pavilions, and some great landscaping."
"It's vast landscape and arrays of building is just nice to see and take pictures of. For 3000KRW, Quite a walk as well so better plan where to go first so not to waste energy. Try joining one of the tour guides at the beginning. The secret garden tour is a guided one and tickets cost another 5000. A worthwhile visit as the secret garden is more picturesque and awesome."
We liked this place. Recommend to go to the Secret Garden - ticket also includes a tour (and there's also an English speaking guide - check the time when tour starts at the ticket office)
Beautiful grounds. Interesting architecture. There is a beautiful pond as well. There is also a changing of the guards display every 15 min in the front. Inside is also an art museum but I think the exhibit changes every few months.
"Seoul, Korea is filled with breathtaking views and gorgeous, historical palaces. I am an Asian Historian, so I go to all of them. I recommend any and all of the Palaces in Korea for the beauty and the historical information."
Its amazing to find the similar architect as in Beijing China. The lost garden is interesting to walk through. I loved the big Mulberry tree. The biggest I ve ever seen in the world
"Huwon (후원, backyard palace) was really beautuful. Even though it was hot day, I feel fresh and cool. Because Hueon is under the trees and shade.

If you want to see real palace be sure to Huwon of Changdeokgung palace in Seoul, South Korea."
"This is my second palace tour in Seoul and while the throne hall is not as ""grand"" as the one in Gyeongbokgung Palace, it has its own charm and I love it!.

The palace is not that crowded or maybe our guide simply took us on places that were not part of the official tour given by this place. I'm glad I signed up for this free tour and because it's a small group, we get much better chance to ask more questions and stray away from the usual pack of tourists roaming around. I love the fact that some areas are really quiet where you can simply sit down on an open balcony and admire the beauty of its surroundings.

The structures of this palace is great and true to its description, it follows the natural topography of the site instead of imposing themselves upon it. I also love the short hike on the natural garden at the back of the palace."
"This palace is much more beautiful than it's big brother to the east. Changdeokgung has a more cobbled together feel, and somehow a more Korean feel than the large rectangular layout of Gyeongbokgung. The gardens are a highlight. Try to get on a tour of the back garden if you can, but if you miss the slot just wandering around the palace grounds is a treat.
Especially good in spring and autumn."
This was an amazing piece of history located in Seoul! Once you walk inside the palace walls you do not realize you are in the middle of a bustling city. The buildings are perfectly restored and the history surrounds you! The throne room is beautiful! It definitely made me want to learn more about the Korean history. There are two small gift shops located on the grounds as well with books in both Korean and English. The whole family enjoyed the visit.
One should see this if in Korea for the first time. It is a wonderful look into the past! The grounds were beautifully maintained and if you can catch the changing of the guard (check with your hotel depending on day and season) it makes for wonderful pictures.
whow -really impressive and perfectly restored- it is a most if you really want to enjoy all of it -take ample of time and idepending on your taste a tour guide or at least a good guide book -so much to learn and to discover
"Its an intersiting sight and I enjoyed touring it.
Overall highly recomnded.
My only reservation is that its all a very new restoration. I expeded a ""real"" historic site.

Tip: Dont miss the folk museum. It is by the palace with free admition. Very intersting with stuff from traditional life in Korea"
Great to see in Seoul. A must see for anyone visiting and people staying a long time. Great photo ops and some cultural history to read.
"This is the best preserved palace in Seoul so the guide books tell us. We were a little disappointed. We went on an English tour. Our guide spoke very good English but she started her commentary to quickly. There were many places where the group had to move in single file and with the best will in the world it took time for the whole group to gather. In the meantime the guide had started her commentary when about 6 people ( out of a group of 20 or more) had arrived so we missed quite a bit.

Although the buildings were very interesting they were completely bare. It would have been good to see some of the rooms furnished appropriately. Another day I visited Unhyeongung Palace which is just down the road and although a lot smaller I found it more interesting because many of the rooms were furnished and even had mannequins of the royal family of the time in them.Tthis palace was free but we paid a modest amount at Chagdeokgung Palace."
This was a really lovely palace and it was early morning so cool for June. Beautiful gardens and worth the extra time to walk through them on the separate tour if you have the time.
"Maybe my favorite palace in Seoul. The main attraction is the secret garden which is amazing.
You can only enter the garden with a tour group, and the tour is an hour and a half long. The tour is also a bit of a hike so make sure your ready for it with good shoes and water.
A must see in Seoul but make sure your ready for a long walk."
"This palace is easy to reach. it Placed near Bukchon. so you could visit this palace also after visiting Bukchon.
you have to pay around 3.000 Won for Palace Tour and 5.000 Won for Secret Garden Tour.
for secret Garden you have to use guide tour, cause entering by your self is not permitted.
they also have english guide to guide you during tour around this palace. they will tell you everything they know about this palace.
you can also visiting the secret garden of the palace. It need a lot of walking so be prepare.
use your sport shoes of flats cause some of the pathways are slippery.
have fun!"
This is my favorite palace. It is really scenic and peaceful. Definitely take the Secret Garden tour. It is beautiful!
"Disclaimer: We didn't take the secret garden tour. It was really hot and we're not big into long, guided tours. The Palace and Grounds (minus the secret garden) were very average. It felt like the dozens of other palaces and temples I've been to in Asia. I can't speak for the secret garden tour, but if you're just planning to visit the regular palace and grounds, don't bother. It's really nothing special."
"There are some many things to explore in this palace, regret not wearing warm enough, should have spent more time exploring the secret gardens too ..."
"Nothing special except the secret garden,, but it is a very long tour if the weather is hot,, we couldn't complete it. It is worth a visit."
"The Secret Garden or the Rear Garden is what makes Changdeokgung Palace one of the most beautiful palace in Seoul. The lush greenery and the fresh air was a wonderful respite from the summer heat. The pavilions which peaked out of the lush trees made the place all the more lovelier. Do remember to buffer time as the entrance to the Secret Garden is a walk from the entrance of Changdeokgung and one can only enter with a tour guide. Tours are unfortunately not as frequent as one would wish. As the tour takes about one and a half hours, one is allowed to turn back anytime one wishes as the tour will end at a different exit from where it started. That turned out to be a nice loophole to turn back and enjoy the beauty of the Secret Garden uninterrupted and to take pictures without people in them. If you only have time for one palace in Seoul, do consider Changdeokgung and her Secret Garden (:"
"TICKETS - buy a group ticket for all 5 temples for 10,000 won instead of separate to save money

Beautiful Temple, very similar to Gyeonbokgung and Changgyeonggung - if you are interested in Temples then its a must see, if you are all templed out and dont have time then skip this and see the main Temple (Gyeonbokgung) its much more touristy - they also have changing of the guards here which is pretty cool to see"
"First of all, the museum is not really tourist-friendly, There is no audio-guide, explanation signs are few and far between and, the most disconcerning, there are only three English tours a day with quite long waiting time in between. Also, the court rooms and decorations on buildings are in desperate need of dusting =((

If you plan to visit the other palace, you can either skip this one, or inquire about Secret Garden tours in advance and time your visit accordingly."
"We did not buy a ticket to Secret Garden, because u can enter a garden only with a guide and guided visits executed every half an hour and lasts for 90 minutes. We didn't have time for waiting. Outside of the garden is just an average temple."
We did the standard tour which was interesting but the secret garden tour was the standout. Allow 90 minutes for this and there is walking involved. Beautiful natural gardens and an interesting story behind each building. Can only be seen on a tour.
"If you are into palaces and historical places, well this place is the right place for you. Its well furnished, and has a very good feel of tourism into it, and has a lot of good background stories and history. Though the tour guide is a bit rusty in English, at least they are friendly and always willing to help."
"I joined the Secret garden tour as I missed the free tour. The secret garden was great and the tour guide was great. But I believe it would be much more interesting to listen to stories for the palace rather than the garden. Nevertheless, the tour and palace is worth seeing."
"This was our first tourist site on our trip to Sth Korea and it proved to be a good one; not just because it is free to enter on the last Wednesday of every month (that was just shear coincidence), (normally it 10000 won = 10 AUD) but it allowed you to wander through the palace grounds at your own pace. The palace grounds are vast which absorbs any crowds well, so you don't get that feeling you are being rushed or even pushed aside when wanting to take that special pic. There is a tour of the secret gardens (in English) at 11.30, which takes approx 90mins, it is informative and nice but if you were pushed for time you could give it a miss. Overall, well worth the time and it took us approx 2hrs plus the 90mins for the secret garden."
"Changdeokgung Palace is a charming historical place that should be on everyone's Seoul itinerary. While Gyeongbokgung Palace is the more popular and larger attraction, Changdeokgung offers a more personal and intimate experience because of its smaller (but still expansive) compound and the lovely Secret Garden.
There are two guided tours here - the outer main buildings and the Secret Garden. I highly recommend both. With so much history and information to absorb, it would be an injustice to the place if you walk around on your own. The Secret Garden, by the way, can only be accessed via the official guided tour. Our tour guides on both tours were outstanding and spoke excellent English. Their knowledge was, of course, extraordinary, but they also made great effort to talk clearly and slowly.
The buildings of the palace were most interesting to me.This palace as I understand it was mainly for living more than ceremonies. It was fascinating to see living quarters of royalty as well as those that served it. Spanning centuries, the palace remained in use until the last century. The tours took us not only through the buildings, but indeed through time.
The Secret Garden was fun but busy with scores of people joining the tour. While hearing the tour guide commentary was difficult at times, we did get the chance to see some striking pavilions by pools and walk along tree-lined paths that really made my day. Anecdotes and tidbits delivered by the guide enhanced a really good visit."
"The Palace is something interesting for first time visitors to Seoul, but make sure you don't miss the Secret Garden, it is the best part.
There is a schedule of guided tours for the SG, and an extra fee - but it is worth it!
A great place for photos, especially in both Winter & Fall."
"The Secret Garden is a beautiful area that is only accessible via the guided tour. A definite recommendation from me for this, as there aren't really many people roaming around since we travel in groups, and the scenery is just gorgeous. Timings between groups are spaced perfectly as well (as we came out of one area of the Secret Garden that had only one exit/entrance, we saw the next group reaching the stop just before entering the same area. Absolutely no clashes between groups). The guide will also warn you when the walking gets tougher (steep slopes and lots of steps) and will allow you to head back to the entrance if you choose to do so. Note that booking can be done online, or at the entrance itself. The online booking system stated no free slots, but when I went there there was still space, so that was a pleasant surprise.

Did not have enough time to take the guided tour of the palace buildings, but I recommend you to do so too, as you would definitely miss out on the stories and a lot of the details worth noting, and every section may start to look the same after awhile.

Also, taking the entrance fee of the palace + the Secret Garden tour is 8,000 won. If you are visiting just another palace or the Jimyo Shrine, it will be a lot better to take the combination ticket, which is just 10,000 won. This includes the 4 palaces and the Jimyo Shrine.

The cafe outside and inside have reasonably priced drinks."
We spent about four hours at this palace. The secret garden is beautiful but not for people unable to walk distances or climb stairs. We enjoyed our visit very much. It was the first palace we visited on our trip.
We came here on a Tuesday as found big palace closed! We enjoyed wandering round the palace without a guide as it is well signed and as we wandered we found more and more places and buildings. It is quite exposed so suntan cream or umbrella advised. Be aware too that there is no food available or advised inside the palace grounds though there are drinks. We also took the Secret Garden tour with a guide which was lovely and peaceful in spite of other groups being there. It was a big group but even my hard of hearing husband could hear the guide well as she had a microphone! It is well worth a visit to see these lovely buildings set in this wonderful woodland garden setting.
"We were disappointed. Although this site is nicely preserved, there wasn't much to see. There was an extra entrance fee for the secret garden, which according to the guide books was the gem of this site. We didn't go in unfortunately. Strollers? Impossible to lug up the huge stone steps in front of every building. Families with young children need to be better prepared than we were."
"This palace is a place for reflection and solace. Just strolling inside gives soothing and healing. I have been to a lot of palaces around the world. European palaces boast magnificent architect and fine arts, and those of Asia show religious sensibility. No other places, however, gives healing than this quiet palace. In particular, secret garden is awesome with its unique structure, beautiful flowers, and calm atmosphere. There is no such a similar palace outside."
"Can't expect to meet that beautiful garden in the middle of Seoul City..
Every season has different color
I am sure you will love this.. Garden.."
"1st trip to Seoul and the 1st place I visited was this palace. Was told it's one with the most history and has numerous locations where famous Korean dramas were shot.

Awesome surroundings, make sure you go for one of the English speaking tours (free) and bring an umbrella / apply suntan on a sunny day - hardly any shades, you'll get burnt... I know coz I did :)"
"It is easy to find fault with the Palace but that would be missing the point.
The site is readily accessible, good value, and interesting in its context.
We were not on a tour and found taking our time to wander where we liked a more relaxing approach and signage was adequate.
Restoration and reconstruction efforts have resulted in an historical 'oasis' amongst the hustle and bustle of modern Korea. For certain, it would be nice to walk around inside the buildings and see fully furnished interiors but that is unrealistic for large numbers of visitors, the wear and tear would be too much.
We found it interesting to discuss the similarities and differences with other Asian palaces we have visited. The setting and the landscape both contribute to the experience."
"A smaller palace as compared to Gyeongbokgung but nonetheless, the place is beautiful. No wonder it is a UNESCO site. I highly recommend that whoever that comes to Changdeokgung to take up their guided tour (Both the palace and the Secret Garden). There are schedules to the guided tours depending on the language, so it would be good if research is done before heading to the palace. You have not seen the beauty until you have been inside the Secret Garden. The Secret Garden is not opened to the public and you can only enter if you opt for the guided tour. It is my second time there, both times during the spring, and I simply love the peace and tranquility there. The tour guide showed us pictures of the Secret Garden during autumn and winter and it is simply amazing. It is one of the must go when in Seoul."
"We took the Seoul City bus tour (I highly recommend) and stopped right at the entrance of the the palace. Tours of the palace and Secret Garden are provided in different languages by guides in traditional garb. The tours are scheduled throughout the day so, it would be wise to look up times before you get to the palace. However, it is still quite enjoyable touring sans translator. We had a translated tour of the garden and wandered through the rest of the palace on our own - I don't feel like we missed out on anything, you get plenty of history on the garden tour.

Everything was very well maintained and I highly recommend a visit!"
"The history surrounding Changdeokgung is very interesting, so highly recommend a tour if you are going to do this one. The Secret Garden tours are about 2 hours apart and are conducted in different languages, so some times you have to wait a bit to take the tour. This was one of my favorite sites in Seould, I think visitors would find it highly interesting."
"Some fantastic and very well preserved buildings here, that give a great insight into the past and traditional architecture. However still urge you to get a tour guide and to make sure you get there at the right time to also visit the Secret Garden.

My only comment is that none of the buildings I saw are furnished... so this is not like visiting an old manor house.... its the buildings themselves (and their remarkable stories) that you come to see and hear.

I did find the juxtaposition of the new city buildings to be quite representative of how things have changed... how once there would have been huge open spaces and now the city crowds right in."
"It looks just like the rest of the Palaces. Structures almost the same as the rest of the Palaces. So it is advised to study the history / stories so that you know what you are visiting.

Secret Garden, needs to be guided by tour. It is not possible to walk on your own. So why at the first place allowed us in without telling us I was rushing for time so did not really enjoy visiting the Secret Garden. Was chased out by rude officers while seeing locals wondering the garden by themselves."
"This palace was the best that we saw in Seoul, mostly because we took the tour. I don't always like tours but there aren't that many places with the history and this tour was really well done and perfect for the surroundings. The secret garden tour is a must do...it is beautiful and great for pictures. Together, the tours are about 2 1/2 hours (60min for the palace & 90min for the garden). One thing is that especially during peak season or holiday times, you need to reserve early. We got luck as we were there 1 weekday and were able to get tickets because all the others were sold out weeks in advance. If you only do one palace in Seoul, I recommend this one but if you have time to do more, it is great to be able to compare them."
"A wide area fulls of historical values and can be seen through the buildings itself. Old palace, gates brings a precious values attracts a lot of people from all over the world."
"In terms of history and architectural layout, Gyeongbokgung scores better than Changdeokgung as a grand palace. However, the Huwon or Secret Garden of Changdeokgung is undeniably beautiful, a must visit if you are in Seoul during autumn or winter. I visited the Huwon on 7th Nov 2013 and the trees burst into a blaze of fall colour, utterly beautiful and stunning.

The guide told us that Huwon showcasing its best during fall and winter. Huwon can only be accessed via guided tour and limited number of tourist per tour. It is advisable to buy ticket online first."
this place is amazing and full of history. pretty crowded the day we went but definitely worth the trip!
Traditional Asian style of palace. I had luxury to visit this with a local guy who told interesting stories. I would suggest to take one of the guided tours. You can spend hours here - but weather should be good as there's quite some walk outside.
You have to purchase the upgrade for the Secret Garden. So beautiful!! The English speaking tour guide was a joy to walk with.
"Royal garden is a must see, great architecture style reflecting the long history of Chosun dynasty."
If you'd like to do the 10:30 general tour and the 11:30 Secret Garden tour - make sure you give yourself a least half an hour of queing time. And pack some snacks. The palace was really majestic and the Secret Garden tour was quite lovely. The tranqulity of the gardens really seem other worldly relative to the hustle and bustle of the city and the queue.
"Visited this palace after a leisurly stroll through Bukchon Hanok Village. On Saturday at around 1 p.m., expect long lines! I waited for around 25-30 minutes before getting to the ticket counter! So it is advisable to come early, as other reviewers have noted :) Palace tickets are 3000 won, while secret garden tickets are 5000 = 8000. Once inside, you are immersed into a maze of beautiful, colorful buildings, nature and history. There are a few sign boards explaning the background of some buildings, also in English (however not as many as at Gyeongbokgung Palace. After having seen the previous palace, this was basically a lot of the same, and the two experiences seem to blend together, so if you have more than one day in Seoul and would like to see both, it is recommended to see them on different days to maximize taking-in ability :)

Overall, however, it is a very nice palace and definately worth seeing!"
"It was closed when we arrived in the late afternoon, but that whole area is nice to walk in, go walk towards Insadong as there are them traditional korean style houses in one neighbourhood. it is very safe to walk in the dark."
"Go early, really.
Plus the 'audio guide shop' was 'sold out' within the first hour we arrived! Until we asked a Korean lady who still managed to get them - the guides are actually available NEXT to the bureau de change! Plus you are required to place your passport with them as a deposit - But they do double check before returning the passports to you which is assuring.
The place - just average for me - nothing much to see and gardens were just okay."
"Very clean and well-maintained. This is my favourite out of the other palaces in downtown Seoul. The secret garden is really beautiful and must be visited. I was told that you can only do so with a guided tour, but when we were there it was open for public visits for two weeks. I can imagine coming back here again to view the scenery against the backdrop of the different seasons. Overall, one of my favourite sights in Seoul! Tip - please come prepared to walk, so a good pair of hiking shoes is recommended especially if you plan on joining the tour. It is not very disabled-friendly as it involves steep terrain and uneven surfaces."
"If you only have time to visit one palace in Seoul, this should be the one. It is more personal and beautiful than others - with wonderfully maintained buildings, including the large formal buildings for coronations, the blue-roofed building for government functions and the less formal private buildings for the king and queen to host dinners. The secret garden is absolutely beautiful, especially if you can visit at a time when it is less crowded."
"clean, tidy and informative, the palaces of Seoul are worth a visit so spend some time and see a few of them"
"Such a beautiful place. This palace was recommended to us over a visit to Gyeongbokgung Palace as it's meant to be prettier. Obviously we went with this recommendation and whilst I can't compare, I can say that we were not disappointed. We made it in time to take the secret garden tour - the only way to see the gardens and the back of the palace, including the prince's private get-away and the servant quarters. The tour guide was was full of really interesting facts and it gave us insight into how Koreans lived in that era, eg. raised rooms that were cooler in Korea's stinking hot summer's. I really, really wish that the library was available on the tour, however we could only look up at it. The courtyard with the pond and the library is stunning. We could've stayed for ages, but we were so tired from walking around. Take some snacks as the shop there only had drinks!"
"The palace is a beautiful sight to behold in the spring. The architecture and ancient trees make any picture you take Instagram-worthy. If you are a bit of a history buff, be sure to sign up online for the English tour of the Secret Garden (Huwon) that happens thrice a day where the 1.5 hours guided tour takes explains the history and culture of the palace. It's also good for a look at the beautiful pavilions and libraries within the Huwon. Until May 11, those signing up for the secret garden section are allowed to stay within it past the guided tour bit. Camera trigger- happy folks will love this place! Location-wise it's walking distance from Anguk-station Line 3, and can spend your time exploring Insa-dong or Bukchon-ro before or after."
The palace complexes are very peaceful and broad places. It takes a while to walk around but you notice that the buildings are fairly empty. Beautiful for pictures. There are also small differences in each one and English markers are placed throughout...
Nice heritage place and scenery. Went in April and happen to see all the flowers. Love the architecture of the palace as well.
The gardens are incredible. We've got great pictures and our kids had a lot of fun running through them. We were lucky and arrived when the English tour included in the ticket started. We recommend to call or research on advance on the schedules so you can take it. Then you can stay after the tour to take pictures without people on them. They told me fall is great due to the colors of the trees. Would like to go back for that.
"This palace is an easy walk from Anguk station on the orange line. Adult admission for the english language palace tour + secret garden tour was around 18000 won. There is an english brochure for 500 won. We took the 10:30 am palace tour followed by the 11:30 garden tour. The garden tour was 1.5 hours long. You can tour the palace on your own but to see the gardens you must be with a guide.

The guides wear traditional hanboks and both of my guides spoke good english. The palace tour is interesting and there was enough information without being overloaded with trivia. The garden tour however was more about the scenery. The lady talked about the functions of the different areas of the gardens but it wasn't very compelling. Also it was more enjoyable to not be in the throng of 50 people that were on the tour and to straggle behind.

I found this palace more interesting than Gyeongbokgung and it is much larger than Deoksugung."
"How to get there: Anguk Station, Exit 3

We toured Changdeokgung last April 15. Our tour guide informed us that unlike the Gyeongbokgung, Changdeokgung is more of authentic Korea-style palace. Inside Changdeokgung are another attractions which are the Secret Garden and Huwon, wherein you will pay for another entrance fee.

Entrance fee for the Changdeokgung is KRW 3,000. But with the Integrated Royal palaces (IRP) Ticket for KRW 10,000, you may visit Seoul's 4 palaces and Jongmyo shrine as much as you want for a month."
"Each of the five main palaces in Seoul have been burned to the ground more than once over their lifespan. Some 600 years old, and with enough original (sic) buildings remaining, this palace is a great place to visit.
When there, you must visit the 'Secret Garden', which is not at all secret, but a glimpse of ancient Seoul, now a bustling metropolis of up to 5 million people.
If you have time, visit all of the palaces. They are all within walking distance of each other and there are some fantastic Hanoks you can stay in in the area between them (Bukchon Hanok Village)."
"Go visit this first before you go to Gyeongbokgung. If you take the English tour, the script is almost the same. Even though this is not the main palace, this seems to be bigger. It's worth to pay the extra fee to see the Secret Garden. Have your comfortable walking shoes on because it's quite a trek."
Its a very nicely preserved temple.very long to walk. You must take a guide to understand .one of the top tourist place.
"What I love about Seoul, is the contrast between the old and the new...modern buildings then smack in the middle is an well preserved piece of history. I am not usually a history buff but since I bought the palace ticket packet I felt that I would be miss out if I don't visit this palace. I felt that this palace a little bit more intimate than Gyeongbukgong..if a palace can be called ""intimate"". I was here primarily for the secret garden tour and my ticket pack already includes the tour. You cannot go on your own, even if you have a ticket ,as they try to limit the number of people, they only have limited tours per day so take note of the tour you want based on the language and be there a few minutes early. Be prepared for a little walk, as the garden winds up and down slopes and hills. The guides tell amusing stories about the names of the buidlings and how the old king named them. I was there end of March so the trees were pretty bare but I could just imagine how beautiful it would be in spring and fall. It's mostly dirt road so it is hard to push strollers or even wheelchairs. Bring water and go to the restroom before going on the tour, as there is only one store and restroom facilities in the middle of the tour which lasts about 1 1/2 hours"
"Changdeokgung Palace is much more tranquil than the other two major palaces of Seoul. It is surrounded by lush gardens and greenery, which even in the winter’s snow can make Changdeokgung look remarkably picturesque, rivalling perhaps even the wintery sight of the incredible Ginkaku-Ji temple in Kyoyo, Japan.

The main garden here is called Huwon which is 78 acres of amazing tranquil greenery. Depending on the season, you can see snow, autumnal leaves or possible some cherry blossoms.

Changdeokgung is the longest-serving royal palace in Seoul, and this made me want to visit it to see what the fuss was about. I enjoyed an hour or so looking at the intricate architecture, but to the untrained eye you must remember that a lot of these palaces and buildings within them all look very similar, so unless you have a particular interest in Joseon Dynasty era palaces, then I think you should prioritise your palaces, and thus I must recommend Gyeongbokgung."
"Our first palace visit in Seoul was Gyeongbokgung. That was a great introduction to the Joseon dynasty, and our visit to Changdeokgung added to that experience. The history of this palace is covered extensively elsewhere, and all the practical information required is in the excellent KTO page http://english.visitkorea.or.kr/enu/SI/SI_EN_3_1_1_1.jsp?cid=264348

We bought an Integrated Ticket of Palaces which covers Changdeokgung, Changgyeonggung, Deoksugung, Gyeongbokgung and Jongmyo Shrine. This was excellent value at 10,000 won.

This time we managed to join an English speaking tour, and we learned so much about life in the royal palaces in that era. As with Gyeongbokgung, there are seats dotted around, so you can bring a picnic or rest your weary feet.

The English tours to the palace are at 10:30am and 14:30, and the English tours to the Secret Garden are at 11:30 and 15:30. We started with the 10:30 palace tour followed immediately by the 11:30 garden tour, and this proved exhausting, especially for my parents who are in their 70s. If time permits, my advice would be to have a break in between the tours by heading to nearby Insadong or Bukchon, with its art galleries, independent craft shops, cafes and restaurants.

You could even consider returning on another day for the Secret Garden. On no account should you join in another language group for the garden tour, as visitors all have to stick together and you are not permitted to wander off on your own. You will be stuck for 90 minutes with a guide speaking in a language you do not understand.

Take this visit at a leisurely pace. This is Seoul at its historical and cultural best and it would be a shame to factor in Changdeokgung as simply one more thing to cross off your Seoul 'to do' list."
"After 7 weeks of touring Asia and SE Asia, palaces and temples really do begin to blend together in one's memory. But if your palace and temple viewing time is limited, then Changdeokgung Palace should be on your list. It's majestic and a large area, fully giving you the feeling of how royal families of Asia lived their secluded lives. DO NOT MISS the Secret Garden here, which requires a separate ticket for the 11:30 a.m. or 1:30 p.m. English-language tour. Get your ticket before tour time as they do limit the numbers that are allowed in. The tour requires a fair amount of walking, including some small hills/steps. The serenity and beauty of this huge area gives your further insight into the lives of emperors, beyond just enjoying the beauty of the area. Tours of the Secret Garden are available in English -- our guide's English was excellent and she did a great job of helping us understand this gem. Enjoy!"
"Definitely worth the visit and inexpensive ticket price.

l recommend the small extra amount for the ""Secret Garden"" guided tour, although be prepared for a lot of walking. The entire Secret Garden grounds are very large, and tour is 1.5 hours long. You can bail out whenever you feel like though, and quickly explore on your own way out."
"While most of these palaces look pretty much the same for the untrained eye, I can recommand the Moonlight tour at this palace. Nice lighting, enjoyable performances and a great tour guide. Have a look a the Korea tourism website to see if one is available when you visit / depends on whether there is a full moon or not."
"We visited on a free-admission day to the Palace and paid for the Secret Garden tour.
The Secret garden trees were mostly bare in March.There is nothing of much interest if you compare this to the other grand gardens of the East or West.The guide(in English) for the palace was pleasant but the guide for the Secret Garden was a bit snotty and it is a long long walk so beware"
"The Palace is very good because it was preserved very well, you can see S. Korea's stories inside this palace."
Rather huge palace grounds with gorgeous cherry blossoms. Enjoyed the scenery and cool spring weather. Must try the sikhye drink at the cafe. It's delicious.
"I went on the Secret Garden tour with my mum after we had looked around the palace (book in advance for the tour). It was quite long but very informative and good to get away from the palace crowds for a bit. It really didn't feel like you're in the middle of a cosmopolitan city when you're standing in a pavillion next to a pond. Really beautiful. Just wish that there was more to see in the buildings as, apart from the throne room, everything is pretty much empty."
"I love the layout of this palace and garden.
Tips: Pls exchange your ticket for Secret Garden in advance before time start; otherwise, you may miss the tour if it's got full. It is not allowed to visit the Garden by your own. English guide tour starts at 11:30 am., 1:30 pm, .... This palace is closed on Monday."
We were terribly lucky to visit during cherry blossom time. The guide was very helpful with the history of the palace buildings and garden design. The gardens far out shine the palace.
If you're going during spring or fall...then arm yourself with extra batteries for your cameras/phone because the place is sooooo pretty.
"I liked how they preserve the beauty of the palace. How can you not love a palace which holds a secret garden? I won’t hesitate to come again here in autumn just to enter the secret garden. I also want to be here when it’s spring. Flowers blooming all around, this place will be magnificent! Here is where the drama, Jewel in the Palace, was filmed. Unfortunately, the kitchen area was under renovation."
"Worth the visit of you are in Seoul. The guided tour of the secret garden was good, though a bit of a walk"
"It's amazing palace, beautiful, worth for visiting. It's a second time in South Korea, but never been here before. Overall it' s a attractive place, a lot of tourist around the world. Very nice weather now."
"I have been 5 or 6 times within the last 25 years to the Forbidden city in Beijing... so I must say that this Palace looks small in comparison. But it is still very nice to visit and take photos. I went there a Saturday around 10:30 and it wasn't so crowdy, unlike any palace in China! This is the thing I like most compared to China, not having 100's of visitors walking and shouting next to you.
Also I liked how the Palace was renovated, you can still feel the age and history of that place. In China, everything they restore just look brand new, as if it was built yesterday.
What I didn't like was that there was barely any furniture so most of the rooms were empty.
I didn't visit the secret garden.
I took the subway to go there, very convenient. I visited Jongmyo shrine first, then walked to the Palace."
interesting it was relaxing to walk around and get lost in the culture the snow blanketed the large grassy areas and it was magical the horse carriage ride is a novel way to travel
"Very nice palace with beautiful garden especially in spring season.
this is the best palace to see, the second I love is Teoksu Palace (덕수궁) with European-like garden."
I went to see the Huwon (Secret Garden) and even though spring had not fully arrived it was still beautiful. A great place to relax and stroll through. I hope to come again in spring or autumn.
"I took the secret garden tour in the winter. It's nice, but the guide showed us pictures of the same spots in the fall and spring, and those certainly look like the better time to go!"
"We took the English-speaking tour of the Secret Garden and it was one of our favorite tours. Our guide's English was very good which was helpful, and the grounds are just beautiful. One can see why the gardens made this palace a favorite during it's time. Book the tour online, in advance, because it fills up. Otherwise, go early and hope for the best."
Lost a camera but it was found and turned into lost and found....nice people....good place to take young children.
"I learned that blue tiled roof are for the King. Not as good as China's Forbidden Kingdom, but its Korean Palace, Korean culture. learnt. Easy to go to."
"Pre-book your Secret Garden English tour at 11:30am on their website before you go. It can be done easily and at no charge. Pay at the ticket office when you reach the palace. You need to pay for the Secret Garden Tour plus the tickets to the palace. The guide speaks very good English. It is a 90-min walk with some slopes but even my 8-year-old could manage without any problems. Although the palace was rebuilt after being damaged several times during war, all the efforts to rebuild the palace are commendable."
"Having been to the Forbidden Palace in Beijing... nothing else could really compare, so I was a bit biased! This palace was very easy to find and easy to get to which was great. The inside was quite nice too, although it is mostly empty rooms... There wasnt that many visitors when I went so you could see everything and take decent pictures without a swarm of people in your photos.
However, I was rather disappointed that they had 'sold out' of tickets for the secret garden! It was the main reason I went... I don't really know how tickets for a garden could sell out... anyway... so you've got to go super early to get tickets for that! I think I went around midday and there were no tickets left.
Anyway, this is quite a nice place to go for history and photos.
Theres a small coffee shop and souvenir shop inside."
"Enjoyed our guided tour of this awesome Palace and hear about the history and the architecture. I am so glad to have seen this
UNESCO World Heritage Site."
It is an absolutely must visit place for every traveler in Seoul. There are English tours available for the palace and secret garden. The tours cost about 3000 and 5000 KRW respectively. The secret garden is very attractive as it is spread over huuuge area and you get to be in the nature and historical place at the same time.
"Very nice experience and nice introduction to Korean culture and history. The guides provide very good information. The secret garden tour is good but the garden itself is not comparable with the gardens of royal palaces in Austria, France, UK, or Egypt but still very exciting. What could be distinguishing about the secret garden is that is really is ""very natural"" or in harmony with the environment."
"The palace is similar to Gyeongbokgung palace but the Secret Garden is well worth it, even in winter you can appreciate it's design and beauty. Without a guide you would not understand it's meaning.
You can book a place on a tour when you first arrive at the Palace entrance, even if you have a combination ticket to get you in. The last English tour was at 15.30, it takes 90 mins, a bit steep in parts but it's not rushed so it's easy."
"Tourists usually flock to the Royal Palace just down the road - and for good reason. Where that palace is grand and majestic, this complex is the verdant escape with more intimate hidden charms. A visit is incomplete without a walk around the Secret Gardens. There are small ponds and streams that snake through the property. Absolutely stunning and each season brings a different perspective. You will know you are in the right part of the grounds if you hit a second barrier requiring a second ticket to walk the grounds."
"Directions: Anguk Station (exit 3) or Jongno 3ga Station (exit 7). I alighted from Anguk station and walked for (if i am not wrong) about 5-10 mins before reaching the entrance of the palace.

Admission fee: 8000 won (inclusive of the secret garden tour, else it is 3000 won for the palace)

Free English tours are available for the following timings:
Palace: 1030am, 230pm lasts about 50mins
Secret Garden: 1130am, 230pm, lasts about 1hr 40 mins

As we reached before 10am, we took the Chinese tour at 10am for the palace. The tour guide speaks good chinese and explained clearly of the historical and significance of the palace.

We then rested and took the 1130am English tour for the secret garden. The tour guide also speaks good english. For the secret garden, there are steep slopes and also stairs that you have to climb. I love the secret garden for the tranquil-ness and it also allows you to take a look at how the royal family live (e.g. the place the prince/emperor studied, the place that they took a walk, the place they rested, the place the national examination took place etc etc). The place is really quiet (of coz, as it is only restricted to the tour) and it is such a nice place to have a walk if possible!

Although the palace size pales par to the Gyeongbokgung, I super love the elegance and tranquil-ness of this place! Even if I come Seoul again, I might visit this palace again!"
"My first time at the palace was in winter of last year, so it was a rather grey experience. However, I really enjoyed taking the English tour of the ""Secret Garden"" section of the palace and was happy that it was offered. There are other areas of the palace I did not have a chance to explore, but that will be remedied soon when the trees and plants are in bloom.

When you take the tour, be prepared for a bit of a hike. Though the majority of the areas are paved, we weren't entirely expecting to be out of breath toward the latter end of our trip."
it was a nice walk through the grounds though in winter the gardens were not as impressive as it would have been compared to other seasons. Was about similar to Gyeingbokgung Palace.
Loved visiting this interesting place. its not expensive and is interesting and informative. Lots to see both inside and out.
"Very similar to Gyeongbokgung, this palace has well kept and accessible buildings. There is a lot to see in terms of architecture, art and interior design."
"went during the winter season, so its really romantic in my opinion. the bare trees and the stories the guide will share, if you ever catch korean dramas, the scene comes out exactly when the king is emo-ing. really cool place to be, just be prepared to walk non stop."
"Beautiful architecture retains painting only available to royalty- simply beautiful! Tour guide Sue Chung from Cosmojin.com (suahc@cosmojin.com) is a fantastic (Korean and English speaking) asset to the city of Seoul- what a great ambassador! She loves history and is eager to share her knowledge.
The azalea gardens will be spectacular in March or April! We did not get to see the ""secret gardens"" and will have to return."
"we visited in November so it was very quiet which despite the cold was actually very nice and peaceful as it felt like we were the only group around! we bought the combination ticket which allows entry into several palaces including the famous secret garden in this palace.

I would definitely recommend to book a tour of your language of choice as this makes the walk around much more interesting instead of walking around an empty palace! The tour guide was very informative and spoke great english.

I enjoyed the secret garden the most and it is possible to get some beautiful shots here! we managed to even catch some autumn red leaves!

if travelling in the winter do make sure to wear comfortable shoes and wrap up! the palace ground tour lasts for 1hour and then the secret garden tour for 90 minutes."
Visited Gyeongbukgung back in 2006 and thought we should visit this palace as well since Changdeokgung is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. But I didn't see much difference between both palaces (building and the grounds). Didn't get to visit the garden as we missed the last English tour which is at 2.30pm. Probably we should have come during other seasons as the palace looks bleak and melting snow was dripping from the roof during winter.
"The Secret Garden sets this palace apart from some of the palaces in the area. Unfortunately, it is mandatory to join a tour to get to the garden pond."
"This is one of favorite palaces in Seoul. The garden and pond area are a must-see! Unfortunately, when we visited the pond was under maintenance and was drained. This was very disappointing but the palaces and garden area was still very beautiful. I would definitely recommend a tour because the grounds are beautiful on their own but the stories make it so much more interesting. There is quite a bit of walking but it is mostly flat so I found it fine to wear sandals but be prepared to walk a lot."
"It's a UNESCO World Heritage Site and the grounds and buildings are lovely. Nice architecture and craftsmanship. From what I've heard, do try to see the secret garden. We'd missed the English speaking tour and there wasn't another one for the rest of the day. Still recommend a visit here. You feel like you're not in downtown Seoul as you walk around the palace and it's grounds. Very peaceful."
"We visited this Palace after having seen all the others in the tour books. It is the best of all the palaces and now I wish we would have done this one before or instead of others. My daughters felt like we had already seen enough palaces, ""that they look similar and even though this was the biggest and best of all of them, they felt over palaced"" if there can be such a feeling. THEN we went on the English Tour of the Secret Garden. Incredible. What a hidden gem behind the stone wall. Even in the winter it was a special place and you could imagine it full of flowers and foliage in other seasons. Loved hearing the tour guide explain about the library and pond and pavillions built for the various views. Would love to come back again and see it come to life in color. But even in the winter, don't miss this garden tour."
"..which combines the Palace and the Secret (Rear) Garden. English tours start at 10:30 (or 11:30am), days need to be checked"
Go to the secret garden during the fall. We went during winter and the tour guide kept apologizing and showing us pictures of what the place looked like in fall.
"Perhaps it was because I missed the English-speaking tour by 10 mins (and I didn't want to wait for the next one which was an hour and a half later), I wasn't too impressed.

Everyone told me the secret garden is the key to the visit, but without a guide, I couldn't enter. It was such a shame.

Overall, the palace is well-perserved, the architecture of the building is beautifully crafted and the surrounding is clean and serene. Even in the freezing winter, the palace managed to keep me walking for over an hour.

It's easy to get to Changdeokgung Palace with the subway, just drop at Anguk Station, get out of the station from exit #3 and walk 5 mins to the entrance of Changdeokgung."
"On a cold day in January, we saw only 2 other visitors BUT one could spend several hours viewing this lovely area on a nice day and we spent over an hour wandering among the many buildings and open areas. It was last reconstructed in 1867 and illustrates well the architecture of a Korean palace that originally dates back to 1405 though it was completely burned in 1592, restored in 1610, and was the main palace for the next 20 years. It is lovely setting, well laid out and it reminded us of Beijing's Forbidden City in miniature. There is a small but welcoming craft shop/coffee shop which gave our feet a break and gave our bodies a welcome waming. A real MUST for a visitor to Seoul."
i visitted on the first day that i visit seoul. this palace quiet beautiful but i think it's similar with other palace that located in seoul. i would like to recommend it to people who love history and heritage place. if you are.. then it would be great place for you to visit
This palace is in the city but has been preserved and enhanced. The modern city all around only adds to the sense of history and the way things change. If you are in Seoul don't miss the expierience.
This one is smaller but very beautiful. It has many quiet places. The cafe us nice. Traffic is not heavy. It snowed when we were there! It was magical.
"The free English guide made a lot of difference for this palace, which would have otherwise been similar to other walk-through palaces in Seoul."
"I went to all three palaces and this was def the nicest. It is remodeled and seems to have some sort of structure. I wish I took a tour as I don't know much about what I was looking at. There are small signs here and there, and large signs with lots and lots of info. I also wish I was able to book a secret garden tour which was not available to be day of because it seemed all the tour groups had booked it. Nearby is a children's museum which was fun for me.
If you're short on time, don't bother with the other palaces. It is the most expensive one, but the best. Also nearby is Bukchon Village (traditional Korean village) and to the other side the Modern Art Museum."
"This was our first palace in Seoul, and the nice thing was that it was not as busy as Gyeongbokgung, great to stroll around and explore on your own. Again, beautiful buildings, very colorful."
"Can spend around 2-3 hours here, I did the secret garden tour which is longer than it needs to be but it is worthwhile."
"On 26 Dec, this was a perfect day to visit Changdeokgung Palace since once we arrived there, it started to snow!! It was so beautiful and it was the first snowing for me. Really really romantic~~
As I registered for the secret garden trip, I needed to hurry to the entrance of the secret garden inside Changdeokgung Palace. (The secret garden was required to register since not more than 50 people per each visit. Registration was easy, just visit their website and choose your language. http://eng.cdg.go.kr/main/main.htm) It was heavy snow at the first 30 mins and then it stopped. Views were wonderful! It was a bonus of the trip.
The tour guide was very funny and informative to explain the attraction inside the secret garden. Many Korean drama were filmed at here! It is good to visit.
The location is easy to find. Near the Palace, there is a subway station - Anguk. It is wonderful to visit Changdeokgung especially the secret garden!"
Make reservations for the tour as early in advance as possible - they sell out quickly and we ended up doing a tour in japanese and didn't understand anything but wanted to see the secret garden
"I was totally drained after the visit to this place but was happy and jumping like a kid who had just visited Disney land because to me the place was way above anything else I had yet seen in Seoul. While purchasing the ticket to the palace, be sure you get the one that also includes the secret garden because apart from the palace and its grounds, secret garden is what you must actually head for. The whole palace complex and the secret garden takes a whole lot of your time and spread over a massive area requires you to be in at least tolerable shape for all those climbs and walks but if you are dreading the physical part, just finish you visit with the palace grounds and the palace itself which in itself is a beauty not to be missed."
"It is amazing to walk around the palace knowing that it is older than the US. The place seeps of history and untold stories of princes and princesses with all the regal functions of a palace court. Oh the stories these walls could tell, only if they could speak."
When visiting Seoul this is one of the places you must see. A beautiful historical site. When possible visit this site during spring time.
"A huge palace.
Well maintenance and tidy.
So many visitors coming to see the ancient palace.
The building was very artistic."
"If you are about its nice to see.. don't go out your way to see it, it's lacking charm and is all too new"
"Always thought the palace is a little more grand from K-dramas but it was a tat disappointing.

However, the Secret Garden tour pretty much salvage the somewhat disappointing tour. Treasures are in the garden!"
Worth a visit especially for a first trip to Seoul. It takes an hour to two to explore the palace leisurely.
"The difference of this palace is its Secret Garden, that you can visit only with a guided tour, for a very small fee. Check the hours for English tours before going there.
You can also go just to enjoy the peaceful and quiet atmosphere too.

The sweet plum tea in the souvenir shop after walking through the place is really nice!"
"We had the palace on the ""to visit"" list and it was definitely worth it. We went on a weekday so it was relatively quiet. It's quite a large area to cover but 2 hours was for us enough to see and read everything there was to know about (hope we didn't miss everything though) The entrance fee was 3000 Won and we bought a guide map for another 500 Won. In the little shop/restaurant we bought a hot chocolate and on our way we went. The buildings are very colorful and the grounds are well maintained. Easy to get to on the subway. If in Seoul you can't miss this!"
One of the 4 Seoul palaces on UNESCO heritage list. They all do end up looking similar.I was there during winter season and it's still beautiful!
"If you have visited the other palaces, you cannot tell the difference of Changdeok from the rest. Though the palace is much serene compared to the others."
"A very large complex. Like everything else, a short walk from the subway. There is a small fee to enter the front grounds, another fee to enter the back palace and another fee to tour the Secret Gardens. Did not tour the Secret Gardens. The back palace tour does not get you inside the ancient buildings but you can look in through windows and doors. One of the larger green spaces in the city. Beautiful and well kept grounds. Saw pictures that the Secret Gardens are even more beautiful but that will be for the next trip."
"Having been to 3 palaces already on previous visits to Seoul, on this trip, I was persuaded by friends to visit Changdeokgung. I was very happy I did. There is no colorful changing of the guard, but the grounds are beautiful and immaculate. There is a lot of ground to cover and lots of buildings to see, but we did manage to get around to all of them. You will be walking on a slight incline as you make your way around the palace, so take your time if you are visiting in warm weather. We paid 3,000 won to get in, but did not pay the extra fee for entrance into the secret garden. The buildings are well maintained and colorful. There is a lot of history here, and there are descriptions in English to describe the buildings. Go early as there are many school groups visiting right around lunch and afternoon. To get there, take line 3 (orange line) and get off at the Angguk station, take exit 4 and walk straight ahead. Cross over the main street, there is a dunkin'donuts on the corner and another short walk and it will be on your left. There are bathroom facilities and snack shops on site. I can not say it is my favorite Palace, but the grounds are beautiful and worth a visit if you have a longer stay in Seoul. (make Deoksugung your first stop)"
"Hit this temple first and buy the 10000 won combination ticket (about $10) If you only have one day in Seoul these palaces, with lunch in insadong (between all of them), and a visit to the temple (right next door) are all you need...but it will be a long day! The english tours at all of them are 11 1 and 3 with changing of the guard on the hour. I would definitely take the tour so you know what your looking at. An added benefit to this palace is out the back gate is the blue house (the presidents house). As you can see a visit to this area of Seoul offers so much."
"Another one of the 4 Seoul palaces on UNESCO heritage list. After a while, they all do end up looking similar. As usual, I liked it because I like the historical surroundings, but can see why others did not like it."
"This is a beautiful palace and attached garden right in the middle of Seoul. Seoul benefits from having many imperial palaces right in the middle of the city, still in good condition today. Do visit the Changdukgung palace (you can now buy a multi ticket that gets you into 5 palaces in Seoul, you will save money). And do the Secret garden tour once you area inside!"
All palaces are very historic and majestic and are fun to visit including having special events like arts shows and holiday celebrations
"For those who love and appreciate culture, I believe this is the right place for you to pay a visit.

I was there during winter season and it's still beautiful however it's kinna dangerous because it is very slippery.

Visited THE AWESOME 'Secret Garden'. I was alone during this tour but I don't feel lonely at all. The English palace tour guide is really friendly and take really good care of us.

It is a worth tour in the Secret Garden. WORTH IT!

I will definitely come back again. Thank you for your Hospitality"
"The Royal garden(secret garden) of Changdeokgung is located in the center of Seoul, so it is very easy for tourists to visit there.We can see the other aspects of Seoul: calmness, peaceful, green, a lot of trees. My number one recommendation in Seoul is Secret garden of Changdeokgung Palace."
Buildings very well preserved and maintained: English speaking guides gave very comprehensive history of buildings and gardens as well as of the people who lived in them. Lots of photo opportunities with autumn colours
"If you only have time for one palace in Seoul, choose Changdeokgung over the rest as it has a beautiful secret garden which is a gem in the middle of the city. It's so peaceful in there that you won't believe you're in the middle of the modern bustling city of Seoul. I went in the fall where the leaves have turned gold and orange, making it even more picturesque than ever.

You need to be part of the tour (various languages) in order to visit the garden, and numbers are controlled. So, go early or have someone from your residence call ahead to make sure you get in the tours. The guide is extremely knowledgable and very humorous, highly recommended!"
The secret garden is really amazing. But don't see it during winter because everything is frozen. I visited it in January and I feel like I have to go again to see the real beauty of the place. The best time to see it are probable spring and fall.
"Great tour in english at 10am, perfect to learn more about it - don't miss the secret garden tour right after, great colors in autumn!"
"only 20 min walk from my hostel, this palace is the right choice to visit. especially if you don't have so much time to explore seoul. changdeokgung is not very big, but in my opinion, the environment feels intimate. fortunately, i visited this place in autumn, where the folliages were so pretty--green, yellow, orange and red under the bright bule sky! i highly recommend to take tour to the secret garden. the friendly and nice guide will take you to explore the beautiful garden and building that the prince used spend his me-time in the old days. prepare your body, and wear the comfortable clothes&shoes, for you need to walk 1,5 hr, up and down the hill."
"The area around the palace is really nice. It is worth going to and you'll experience lots of the Korean culture. There are lots of Koreans going round the temples so it looks like they like going to see their own temples.
its worth going to and its really pretty"
Have been here before and I specifically wanted to see the secret garden in autumn. It did not disappoint. The colours were wonderful. The secret garden is on a separate ticket to the Palace ticket. Well worth the extra money. They run tours in various languages. English tour runs twice a day and has a limit of 100 people per tour.
"The Palace and the surroundings especially the garden known as "" The Secret Garden' is especially beautiful especially in the Autumn with most of the trees changing foliage and displaying their magnificent colours at that time of the year. Awesome photo taking opportunity.
Try to be present when the English speaking tour is being conducted as that will give you more insight into all the pavilions and buildings in the large garden. The guide will point out several interesting aspects of the garden which you might miss out on your own.
Rest of the Palace buildings are interesting but nothing special unless you like history and architecture.
There are 2 tours being conducted, one for the Palace and the other for the Secret Garden."
"This wasn't too bad and cheap to enter. Worth a visit if you are I the area
We didn't see the gardens, but it appears that May have been the highlight."
Go in good weather. See the garden but beware the long walk needed much of it up/down steep hills. Need a guide booklet really.
"The secret Garden here in early November is simply breathtaking. The palace too is quite impressive and it is definitely worth taking the tour. There are only 2 tours a day in English and if you take them back to back you'll feel rushed - especially the palace tour becomes rushed because it leads right in to the Secret Garden tour. I suggest taking the 10.30 tour of the Palace, go and have some great lunch and come back at 1.30 for the Secret Garden tour. Also the light is better in the garden in the afternoon for photographs - which I am sure you will want to take."
We took a guided tour to visit this palace during the second week of October. It is a beautiful place and the weather was good so we enjoyed the tour. One of the place that one shouldn't miss when visiting Seoul.
This is another must see of Seoul. But wait for the regular guided tour. It all makes more sense if a guide shows you around. I took the English tour and the guide was simply great.
"You will get more out of this if you take a short guided tour. The secret garden is worth joining to get the most out of your experience here.

Few tough short hills so wear your walking shoes and carry a bottle of water."
"We went on the english tour (1 1/2h) and it was so pretty. There were around 50-100 people on the walking tour, and we had a guide dressed in a hanbok bringing us around the Huwon secret garden. Big, curled trees, still ponds, painted gazebos/houses. It's more of a park than a garden if you ask me. But definitely beautiful."
This palace was beautiful! Make sure you time it correctly so that you arrive in time for the guided tour of the secret garden. You can only enter via a tour.
"I have been to this Secret garden Winter last year. It was wonderful and special experience.

I would like to go there again this year. It is difficult for me to book a secret garden ticket in advance. I am lucky to have booked 3 adults tickets for chinese language tour in 9th November. However, I want to adjust my flight a bit and will not be free on that day. I am looking for someone to exchange my tickets with another day tickets."
"This one is less crowded than the bigger Gyeongbokgung but is definitely worth visiting. Be sure to catch the free English tour for a better appreciation of the palace, the history of Korea, and the lives of the royal family.

Within the Changdeokgung is the Secret Garden (separate fee; with tour guide), which for me was overrated, and can be skipped as there is not much to see. Given all the walking (up and down slopes and stairs) that I did, the garden wasn't just impressive enough."
Nice palace for a restful visit. Specially nice in late afternoon. Don't rush and enjoy a nice walk to feel the beauty of the place.
"Once you've seen one palace, you've essentially seen them all. Changdeokgung has a 'secret garden' but don't expect too much, it's really more of a small forest with some forgettable pagodas scattered around. It's pretty, but not a must-see. If you've only got time for one palace, choose Gyeongbokgung.

However, Changdeokgung is very close to Insa-dong, a fun neighborhood for souvenir shopping, so if you want culture and shopping all at the same subway stop, this might be your palace."
"Warning: The Secret Garden tour involves strenuous up and down hill walking. Elderly, disabled, those with young children beware. There are no more self guided visits to the Secret Garden on Thursdays - only guided visits. Actually the Secret Garden itself is slightly overrated and not worth the time. A few pools and buildings you can't enter and lots of trees with no view. If you are short of time skip it. In fact if you have seen Gyeongbokgung palace this one is optional - more of the same thing."
"If you are going to visit the palaces in Korea, just choose one would do. The Changdeokgung is a UNESCO World Cultural Heritage site. The grounds are pretty big, but apart from the structure of the palace buildings, the insides are pretty much empty.

The admission fee is 3,000 KRW, and if you would like to visit the secret gardens, that is an additional 2,000 KRW (please check their website as I did not choose the secret garden option).

If you have made it to the Changdeokgung Palace, do not miss walking through the Bukchon area (next to the palace). Go to the information counter to get a Bukchon map. You can even catch a different view of the palace grounds from Bukchon."
Historically this palace of one of the most well known palace as it is located in the center of the city. Many traditional activities performed daily such as palace guards and marching band. Fun place to visit.
"Despite fires and foreign conquering, the palaces tell a faithful story of the unique Korean heritage."
"changdeokgung palace is connected to changxigung palace. the hightlight is the secret garden.

in the secret garden, you will found that the gardens are all connected. the hostel for female servants and male servants are connected too. this supposingly not to be happen in any of the palace in ancient years ago. so i believed there were a lot of stories in this palace in the ancient years.

the design of changdeokgung palace is a bit different compare to gyeongbukgung but the color of the building are almost same. Some crafting of the hut were designed with lotus, we know that the religion during that time is buddhist.

there are the warming system for most of the building(especially living room) in the palace and all doors can be hang up during summer or during ceremony /festivals.

the palace is not very big, just enjoy the natural sight and immagine the happened stories of this palace."
Well preserved palace and an easy visit. It says that you have to go on a guided tour but we entered around 3:30PM (no English guide at this time) and were able to enter and walk at our leisure. Nice walk for a cool day.
"You can buy a combined ticket and visit here, it is nice to see how a korean palace is different than other asians, but overall the tour is not very interesting..."
"We spent a couple of hours wandering around the palace grounds and doing the secret garden tour. Unlike most palaces/castles in Japan, in Korea you generally can't go inside the buildings, so keep in mind that you'll be outdoors the whole time when planning a visit. The extra 5000 won for the garden is worth it, and going on a tour helps you get the most out of the experience. The English tour guide was very knowledgeable and included interesting facts and anecdotes."
"Hearing about the history sure made the visit to this palace pretty interesting. Again, historically South Korea is fairly young, ad post the war etc, most constructions including this one seem fairly new. But worth a visit"
this palace very near from my hostel.. and i like this palace.. not a biggest one but i enjoy touring in this palace..
"The palace was so beautiful and well-reserved. I had a great tour here, very interesting and informative. And the fact that besides being a tourist attraction, this place also used in many famous Korean films. I would love to watch some of them."
"If you want to learn something about Korean history, this is the right place. Well preserved palace complex with beautiful buildings. Definitely don't miss Secret Garden. I can recommend guided tour when you learn some interesting facts about life in this palace."
Beautiful palace that is wonderfully preserved. Was here for an hour since I was on a quick paced tour! So take your time to enjoy the site!!
"Easy to get to from the orange subway line. Price was less than $4 for the self tour, not inclusive of the secret garden. We were time crunched and read the signs and took in the expansive palace by ourselves. Explored the palace in approximately 40 minutes and took great pictures along the way"
"This palace was a large collection of buildings in good repair and full of interesting information about the ruling families. Be siure to sign up for a tour of the ""Secret Garden"" as you need to have a guide to see it and its well worth seeing."
"the Palace is beautiful and i love the secret garden very well.. a best place to relax and breath some fresh air.. by visiting the secret garden, u need to pay extra and there will be a tour guide to explain for the whole journey.. you can choose your preferred language session which include English, Chinese, Japanese and Korea of cause.. :)"
"Though I thought the Gyeongbokgung Palace was more interesting and beautiful this was certainly worth going to if you enjoy a peaceful walk through pleasant, well-maintained greenery. If you're short on time maybe skip this one but it was something my son and I enjoyed. It's quite a large area and wasn't too crowded when we went which also made it a nice experience."
"The gates to these types of palaces are very ornamental and impressive. Once inside the palace walls you will be amazed of what little city noise can be heard. Well preserved, well maintained, and well manicured the grounds are fantastic rich with culture and architecture. If you want ideas for an ornamental garden this is one great place for you."
"I so love koreanovela and this is perfect pic location to show your friends (truthfully for my own satisfaction )you've actually stepped on where the , hallyu star filmed there dramas."
"The kings of Joseon dynasty built five palaces within the fort walls of Seoul. One of them is extinct. Of the other four, Changdeok Palace is the best. Unlike Europe and Asia, these palaces lack grandeur, artistry or ornamentation. They are simple wooden structures with traditional curved roof and expansive botanical garden for a refreshing sojourn."
"Changdeokgung is the place to be for a family in the right weather. The Secret Garden tour is absolutely amazing, the tour guide is friendly and enthusiastic. The specialities in The Secret Garden tour are rather sparse, however, for maximum viewing pleasure, I would recommend going in spring or whenever, preferably when the cherry blossoms would bloom. In addition, The Secret Garden Tour is a must for those interested in the Chinese occupation of Korea, including ancient architecture and beliefs as it is ultimately an insight into the Joseon Dynasty.To sum it all up, this place has many great tourist attractions, great for taking photos and delving into the interesting past."
"Impressive grounds and very peaceful. You don't need to join a tour for the grounds, but you do need to for the secret garden. The secret garden is huge and the tour took 1.5 hours, very interesting and worthwhile. The grounds themselves are not as extensive as Gyeonbokgung Palace and because there is no grass, it'snot as pretty in my opinion. However, right next door, as in the next street is one of the traditional 'villages' with the traditional houses. Yes it's a bit commercialised with a 7 /11 shop frontage and various other businesses, but you get the idea of how tiny the houses are/were and the narrowness of the streets in the old days."
"I actually prefer Changdokgung Palace more than Gyeongbokgung Palace as it is more peaceful and quieter. There are not many tourists too. The secret garden is worth the 5000won as you can see a different part of the palace and there will be guide touring you around. The tour is about 1.5hours. English, Chinese and Japanese language is available. Do check out my blog to read and see the pictures, have fun!

"Amazing palace. Make sure you catch a tour for the Huwon Secret Garden. It lasts 1,5 hour and it is an amazing environment."
The palace in itself is very nice and easy to walk around in an hour or so. It's not the best palace in my opinion but what makes it stand out is the secret garden. You will need to join a tour to visit the part of the palace as it's closed off to the general public and a ticket costs an extra ₩5000. The tour lasts around 90 mins and is very informative. You get to see some awesome buildings and get a feel of how royalty really lived. Highly recommend this place!
"When I went in 2006, the tour group was small and intimate. I could hear everything and see everything. This year, the tour group sixe limit increased to 30pax and it was too crowded. Too many ppl trying to take pictures while you try to admire the structures. Kids running around and making noise while the guide was speaking. However, it still retain its beauty and is still amazing to look at."
"I always loved to watch the Korean Period Drama hence this is on top of my must visit list in Seoul. Entrance fee is cheap at only 3.000won and 5.000won for a guided tour to the Secret Garden. The pamphlet that have the introduction of the sights cost 500won. I would recommend getting one before starting so that you know what you are looking at.

Unlike the fancy palaces in China, the palaces in Seoul are more plain but I still find them interesting. I thought it would be nice if they could add more visual or relics so that we could understand better how the living was in the past. However, this might spoilt the historic feel and become more commercial. during my visit, I see more korean students than mass tourist."
"Lovely place and very interesting.
Easy to get to by either walking or train.
Enjoyed watching the guards at the entrance to the palace.
Cheap entry fee."
One thing I didn't expect to see in Seoul during my 5 hour transit tour was cherry blossom/sakura trees and they were in the palace grounds. I liked seeing the elaborate architecture with colorful roofs. However I get to go into the Secret Garden much to my disappointment but seeing the pictures of it were still very beautiful. If I remember right I saw a shop where people could try on traditional costumes somewhere inside this palace.
"magnificent palace grounds, interesting structures, plenty of history. another must see palace besides Gyeongbokgung."
"it's a palace where they shot the drama jang ok jung.....bought ticket also to the secret garden(optional)......you have to bring the map to go around the palace....they have about 14 to 16 spots to see in the secret garden.....to enter the secret garden, you have to book the time with the tour guide ( we chose english guide).....it was a very long ""journey"" in the secret garden...make sure you dont wear high heel shoes becoz we have to go up and down the hills..... the garden also is very big n full of history.......better think first before you buy a ticket to the secret garden if you dont want to walk about one hour in a group, climb hills and listen to the history of the garden."
"Since I only have limited time in Korea, I decided to visit only the best places there, including this palace, since it's said to be the most beautiful one, among others. But since I didn't visit other palaces, I couldn't objectively compare. It's a beautiful, grand, and majestic complex of palace indeed. I bet it's better to visit it in autumn, so that you could enjoy the view of autumn leaves. I came at summer, so the surrounding's all green, which is also beautiful, actually. Too bad I didn't take the tour to Secret Garden since it didn't match the schedule, but I guess the most beautiful part of the palace is hidden in Secret Garden.

Use the running shoes, since the complex is so huge. Better wear a hat and bring an umbrella if you visit on summer. From Anguk Station, take exit number 3 and just go straight. It should only be 300-500 m walks. I took the wrong exit and had to walk over 1.5 km before I could find the Donhwamun gate."
"With 5 palaces in Seoul, Changdeokgung Palace (창덕궁) is the place to be if you want to admire the pretty spring/autumn blossoms set amidst a historic cultural backdrop (that and a good workout with all that walking!). Famed for its gardens, Changdeokgung Palace’s Secret Garden (Biwon 비원 / Huwon 후원) is the place to be if you want to admire some pretty spring/autumn blossoms!

Having a guide is great for understanding the history and hearing the stories come to life. Of course, there are guide books and signage, but nothing beats having a guide narrate to you while you take in the scenery and historical architecture around you. The admission for the Secret Garden Tour is an additional ₩5,000, but well worth it. You can always purchase the Secret Garden Tour on the spot, or you could reserve online.

After all the walking, there is a rest stop within the palace ground. The toilet is clean and the rest stop has some pretty neat souvenirs, there is even free wi-fi. Do check out my blog for more on my experience and pretty spring photos at Changdeokgung Palace!"
"Very beautiful place and well preserved. They offer free guide tours in english so you can enjoy the history of the various nobles that lived there. The area is huge and ""green""."
"I felt like I missed a lot of the fun by not having a guide to tell me all the kingdom gossip -- and somehow my printed guide didn't have enough information about the place.

To go to the Secret Garden it is compulsory to follow their guide (tours in English at 11am, unlimited number of visitors), and that has its ups and downs: the bad part was that having one guide to an unlimited number of people can be a bit confusing -- plus being in a tour group isn't always that fun; on the bright side, the guide told us a lot about the history and the architecture of the place, which is always interesting. Worth the visit, even if you don't like to be surrounded by a zillion tourists."
"Once again this is a stop for the Seoul tourist bus, and is a well kept property. Could use better information maps to help find your way around."
"This is a great palace, easy to get around, with many great stories about royal life to hear. Make sure the guide tells you about all the palace intrigue."
The palace is beautiful but you visit here to see the garden. The tour takes 90 minutes and the walk is lovely - exactly what you would expect to see in a Korean garden. Lily ponds and a very peaceful atmosphere. A nice way to escape the busy downtown and spend some quiet time in a traditional Korean setting.
This is a very good place to visit in Seoul. The palace is beautiful. The secret garden is the another place that you must have to see.
The architecture and the grounds were amazing. The history of Korea can be seen from the surroundings. My brother-inlaw took us and we watched the changing of the guard. It was a real treat for all visitors.
"A visit to this palace made a film titled 'Jumong' very real. I visited the several sections of the palace and the secret garden. The palace is situated on a vast land of several hundreds of acres. The fish ponds, streams and relaxation sites of the old king. The examination center, where the king is the 'invigilator'. The beautiful structures especially the roofs are just too wonderful. The Juniper tree that has lived almost a thousand years. I will recommend this place for relaxation and at the same time a place to learn about the history of the ancient Kings. They enjoyed life more than any modern king could venture."
"Entering this palace is such an amazing contrast from the past-paced life of modern Seoul. The moment you step through the front gates you are filled with a sense of serenity. I arrived two hours before my guided tour of the Secret Garden, and spent every second exploring the palace. Every intricate detail is beautifully maintained or restored. The Secret Garden tour is a must, you will be astonished at how easily you can breathe when you enter the area away from traffic and the cluttered city. Also, the architecture and symbolism throughout the garden is stunning- make sure to pay attention to your tour guide or do research beforehand. I recommend paying the extra 2,000 won ($2) for the 4 palace tour. You will be saving a significant amount, and Gyeongbokgung Palace is a 10 minute walk away. Make sure to grab some inexpensive and amazing street food on the way!

The palace is also close to many art museums and other monuments- plan for a BIG day!"
"we really feel disappointed because we didn't have much time to explore secret garden. i heard this one is the highlight of this palace.
we know this palace from rooftop prince, one of korean drama.there was not many tourist visit this palace.
this palace is near with buckhon hanok village"
"Do visit and take the guided tour of the Palace followed by the hidden garden tour. Total cost was about $8US or you can get a combined ticket for $10US which allows you into 4 palaces!
Great history and beautiful gardens! Take an umbrella with you if visiting in the summer as the sun is very hot!"
"I visited the complex with a friend. We bought the ticket for the four palaces and the shrine, which costs us 10.000 won. For European measures quite cheap.
The place offers a lot of buildings with different functionalities. It is nice to get around and just take some photos. You always have some tourists around you."
"This is one of Seoul's highlights and aside from seeing the palace on a normal tour I would recommend two specific tours, both of which need to be booked well in advance:

1.Tour of the Secret Garden - perhaps the most beautiful place you will find in Seoul, being the private garden of the kings, a large, hilly and wooded area with lakes and pavillions.

2.Moonlight (full-moon) tour of the palace, which occurs just two nights a month, and comprises the palace and parts of the Secret Garden, ending in a traditional stage performance of music and dancing, with Korean snacks and drink provided. The whole experience is magical."
"This palace is a UNESCO World Heritage, and once you're there, you can understand why. The architecture of the palace is astounding, especially how it blends in with nature. I took the secret garden tour, and I would really recommend you to do that. It costs an extra 5000 won, but it's definitely worth it. The tour guides (well, at least the one assigned to my group) have a vast knowledge of the history of every single building in the complex, and explain it all in a very good English! (Though tours are also available in Japanese and Chinese.)"
"This is a UNESCO World Heritage site so I labelled this as a must-visit. To enter the complex, you must pay 3000 Won. Upon entering you'll see the palace said to be favored by the Joseon-era royalty. The area is tranquil and the greenery around the area gives a calming effect. However, that calming effect will be shattered when you discover you have to pay another set of fees to see the Secret Garden and/or the Changgyeonggung Palace.

We made the mistake of going here first before Gyeongbukgung, since Changdeokgung doesn't offer the 2 for 1 Palace deal. If you plan to see both palaces, go to Gyeongbukgung first.

After touring the palaces, Innsadong shopping street is near enough where you can grab a bite or a few souvenirs."
"It was okay and if you have extra time to spend here then visit other wise I will advice you to visit only any one palace and then enjoy Seoul's local markets and pubs as they were much more enjoyable to me; however, you might find it different."
"Beautiful place and very well preserved. I recommend joining the 45 mins guided tour, break for 15 mins then followed by another 1.5 hr guided tour to the Secret Garden within the palace grounds. The guide will show you the Secret Garden gate during the tour. Both places require admission tickets so if you intend to visit the other palaces too then get the integrated package. Bring an umbrella if you are visiting during the wet months as there are not many shelters when it rains."
"We visited this beautiful palace and grounds as part of a tour and I would highly recommend doing it with a guide as the history and details are much richer if you have a professional guide to help you see what is there and to appreciate the history of the place and the country.

The architectural detail is amazing and the grounds are immaculate. I wish we had more time to spend in the Secret Garden but that's for another trip."
"No wonder it's a Unesco World Heritage. The palace is well-restored. You'll learn a lot about the history of Korea here. It's a huge one too, so better to go about with the tour guide, or you'll end up not seeing everything the Palace can offer. The secret garden is also here but requires another entrance fee, so we didn't see it. I heard it's really beautiful inside. If you're not much into palaces, like me, visiting one will be okay I think. Since most palaces are under the Joseon dynasty, they practically look all the same to me."
Great place to visit during your vacation. You will have to walk a lot to see all the palaces and grounds but it is worth the money you pay to visit it
"So, there are 2 main palaces in Seoul and they're not that far apart. In fact we walked from here to the other one, Gyeongbokgung. But I feel that we ran out of time trying to see both places on the same day with 2 kids in tow. Changdeokgung is the ""newer"" palace out of the 2 and it seems most of the history of this palace dates back to the 1800s & early 1900s. As is the case for both palaces, many of the structures were recently rebuilt due to the turbulent history of wars and occupations that had damaged or destroyed a significant part of the palace original buildings. There were also destruction from fires and such. Still, they are indeed very beautiful and will give you a good sense of Korean culture, art, and history. Somehow we were not able to see every single part of Changdeokgung. I think you needed to hire a private tour guide to get to the inner sanctum areas. So, we only got to see the main buildings. There was a general tour in English that starts at 10am every weekday, I think, that we took. Anyone who paid the regular entrance fee can just join that. It was curious that most of the buildings were largely empty on the inside, even the royal residences. There weren't any furniture or other things inside. Most every structure were just empty. It's hard to get an idea of what they were used for if the tour guide didn't tell you. The pamphlet does give you a decent amount of info. I suppose. Definitely go see both the palaces if you have the time. They're the main attractions in Seoul for sure."
"Not too many tourist as the main palace and we had ample time to take in the architecture as well as the landscape.

Worth to take the guided tour of the Secret Garden if you enjoy nature."
"The tour of the gardens at Changdeokgung Palace was one of the highlights of our recent trip to Seoul. The grounds were absolutely stunning, our tour guide was informative and humorous, and it was absolutely worth the visit. Of all the sightseeing we did, this was the one stop not to be missed."
"Joined the Korean secret garden tour and the guide did a great job of explaining each structure and tried to involve the participants by asking questions. It was a 90 minute tour and there were some steep slopes and climbs.

As I went in the summer, the weather made it uncomfortable to tour, but I'm sure it'll be a lot more pleasant in autumn when the autumn foilage is in.

I prefer Changdeokgung as it appears more peaceful to me than Gyeongbokgung."
"Of the palaces this one might require the most walking (if you visit the Secret Garden) but it is spectacular! I can't wait to go back in the fall to see the leaves and enjoy it without the heat. Our guide in the Secret Garden had the best English of any Palace guide I've heard in Korea. She did a great job!

Note- If you go on the Secret Garden tour with a stroller or wheel chair you will be asked to return a different way from the rest of the crowd to avoid a long series of stairs. This is cool because that means that you are allowed to be alone in the Secret Garden section (under the steady surveillance of CCTV cameras ofcourse)!

Remarkably stroller friendly and bathrooms were clean and easily accessible.

Look into buying the book of tickets to multiple palaces. It's a great savings!"
It is a unique attraction especially if you appreciate traditional architecture. It is a great place to visit and understand more about the history of Korea.
This is a great place to get in and go at your own pace and see alot of Korean Natural History and make sure you get yourself ready for walking cause this place is big!! A great place to go even during peak season times cause you can pick and choose where you go and what you see.. Im not a tour group person at all.. i think that its too commercial and i feel like a number instead of a guest... Enjoy this place its worth the trip
"Did the 1 hour English tour and spent another 30 minutes walking around. Love the feel of this palace. The tour guide informed that only about 30% of the buildings that were original have been restored, but even despite that, I loved the feeling of being in a maze in what buildings were there. It is not so huge, but even with so many tourists, you could easily find a secluded area that gave a great sense of solitude. The tour was quick enough to be engaging, but no so long that you were waiting for it to finish. I really enjoyed visiting this Palace and hope you do too!"
"The palace is actually a number of building across a huge campus that combine multiple styles of Korean royal history. The secret garden is a separate ""hike"" and is offered as an additional tour. Wear comfortable walking shoes !"
"Visited 2 major palaces of the Korean kings, this one and Gyeongbokgung. The latter resembles a smaller scale version of Beijing's Forbidden City, this is more like the Beijing Summer Palace. Choose this one if you can't see both. The English language guided tour of the palace was very informative. The separate ""garden"" tour is worth the effort -- it is really an extensive park with numerous pavilions of interest. Beware that it involves lots of walking up and down some steep slopes compared to the palace tour."
"I wanted to know more about the structures and the people who lived in them. The site is well preserved and wasn't very crowded. If you like architecture and history, then this will interest you."
"Although impressive you start to realize that kings and queens here leave in absolute harmony with the environment ,something unusual to what I am aware of"
"Changdeokgung was one of the five grand palaces in the last Korean dynasty. It is close to the main place. While lacking the majesty and symmetry of the main place, the palace blended well in the natural surroundings. It might be more fun to live here, since it came closer to a royal garden. You have to pay extra to see some attraction after you enter the main entrance."
"After a few Palaces they can become a bit of the same kinds of things BUT everyone of them has something special about it that another does not have. Its there ""Gem"" and each one has one, the ""Secret Garden"" is the treasure spot for Changdeokgung Palace. It's BREATHTAKING! There is no point in going here & not doing that tour (no privet tours of the garden) it's a must see."
"The palace buildings were colorful; the gardens beautiful. The tour of the Secret Gardens was nice but a bit long. It is definitely worth it, but you can opt out halfway through."
Why not check it out and learn a bit about Korean history. It is well worth the pocket change for the entry fee.
This place is so calm and beautiful unless you get to meet group tours. The garden is very pretty and I recommend for couples since it's a romantic place to date!
"The Changdeok palace is one of the finest palaces that I have visited in Asia. This should feature in your top 3 things to do in Seoul and for me, rates higher than the more famous Gyeongbokgung palace. I greatly recommend t that you take the English tour (10-30 am and 230pm). The guides are well informed, articulate and entertaining. I suggest that you take the subway. Prepare to spend 3 hours between the palace and the secret garden (3,000 won). Do carry water as the walk can get demanding especially is you visit in summer. Get off at the Anghok station on line 3 (station 328) and walk on foot from exit 3. Its a ten minute walk to the palace. The architecture is asymmetric beauty and is beautifully constructed in harmony with the topography. The secret garden tour is worth visiting and I must add that this palace is a UNESCO world heritage site. Its also remarkable as to how well restored the place is: considering that it was destroyed after the Japanese invasion in 1592."
See the palace and garden tour - about the best in Seoul for history/culture. Compared to many other Far Eastern cities there is not that much left in Seoul so this is as good as you will find.
"If you only want/can do one palace while in Seoul, do this one. It is much prettier than Gyeongbokgung. Yes, do the Secret Garden tour though I was a bit too early for Spring's arrival."
A very good choice to understand the historical culture of Korean people and kings while you can enjoy the unique architecture.
"We visited Changdeokgung in June of 2013. We went there on a guided tour and spent around an hour at the palace. We started out watching the changing of the guards, which I can only recommend! It was great to see the guards in traditional clothing and the ceremony itself was great to see. After that we walked from the South to the North gate and saw the main points of the palace - the King and Queen quarters, the courtyards and we finished at the pond near the North gate, where we took beautiful pictures!
Having a guide with us was great - but going by yourself to just stroll around the palace would also be great. This is a Seoul-must see!"
"fascinating place. Tour well worth the time and cost. Lovely grounds. Furnishings in buildings are a bit sparse, but that seems to be the norm with Asian palaces"
"A must visit !
I felt the culture out there in this place.. I do recommend it to everyone visiting South Korea"
"Incredible palace. The garden was beautiful. The tour in the Secret Garden is what made this a succesful visit for me and my family. We thought it seemed a bit long lasting 90 minutes, but it is definitely a must. English guide was sweet and informative."
"Went on a cultural trip and learned so much about the history of this palace.
The tour guide spoke English well, but some words were muffled at times, as she spoke a little fast.
Lots of walking, and some steep hills, that you can opt out of walking, but all in all I got some great pictures, and had a good time."
"It has more history, its better maintained, but its also smaller than Geongbokgung palace, which I prefer.

The tours are a better here and will give you more appreciation of the history.

The hidden garden is worth the side trip too, if you like a good walk through the gardens (forest).

Lots of places to visit within the area too."
"We joined the English tour and I appreciated the history of Korean dynasties. If you have limited time, you may skip other palaces and pick this one."
"i didnt have high hope for this palace due to the grandeur gyeongbokgung. boy was i wrong. its simplicity, closeness to nature and quiet beauty i feel is the reason why the korean kings long abandoned gyeongbokgung palace as the primary place of residence and work. i went just after it rained and it didn't have many people. perfect for just sitting down at the thrown hall and just appreciating its history. i recommend the daejojeon (queens bedchamber) for its wall art. Please go for the huwon garden tour, either in English or Korean. its a wonderful little hike and the forest area dotted with pavilions and ponds and libraries are well worth the my to seoul. note wear good shoes. the hills in the secret garden are steep."
"This is easily the most interesting palace in Seoul, and I saw them all! Don't miss the Secret Garden (separate admission)."
"A working palace till the last of the Korean Royalty succumbed to old age some 20 years ago, lends poignancy to these buildings from another age. There is paid entry, but the guided tours are free, and well worthwhile. The tours are timed to link smoothly with the Secret Garden tours. A must see in Seoul."
"The secret garden tour is very nice, but you need to be into palaces and the like. Not a must see for everyone. After the tour enjoy a cold tea at the Craft Shop on the grounds. The teas are syrupy wonderfulness!"
"The only UNESCO World Heritage place in Seoul, but very similar to the other palace except for the Secret Garden. The garden is very beautiful but unfortunately it's still a restricted area only accessible via large group tours- 85 minutes long - only 3 in English each day so check before you go. Natural forest garden w/royal structures & ponds. Had streams & falls that are mostly dry now. Not a manicured garden. Nice to escape city heat in summer- must be spectacular in fall foliage."
"you have to do a tour to the palaces from Seul like a essential part of your trip. All this palaces are very similars, and are the remnants of its traditions, a haven in a ultramodern city."
"This palace is HUDGE! its so beautiful you should spend one day here, the main palace is the biggest palace in Changdeokgung Palace. be there before 10:00 am cause there is a show, the show is about the guards guarding the gate of the caste.. Very interesting how they move Dont miss this! There is a subway station that stops at the palace, Keep in mind that the subway station now was part of the palace but was destyod cause of the war. They also have a mesuem about Changdeokgung Palace. The king and Queens clothes, the car the use to ride, the food they use to eat, their books, letters and so on. Did I mention the secret garden? The secret Garden is a hidden gem.. you can only visit it with the guided tour (90 minutes, W5000 or $3 US) In the palace they do have audio guids as well so you can walk arond and they would tell you what is this and that. They also a english tour for free. at certain times only"
"This is my second times visiting this palace.Since I am alone and nobody is holding me back, Instead of blindly roaming the palace alone, I decide to join the Palace tour + The secret garden tour. Both in English.
For the palace tour (KRW 3,000), the guide is and old lady, clearly explain the history of this palace and all. I think, if times allow, it is better you join this tour because it is a waste to only look at this beautiful buildings without knowing the story behind it. But, if you too concern about your time (ya, there is a lot to do in Seoul in 1 day), you can skip this.

Just after I finished the Palace Tour, I continue with the Secret Garden Tour.
It will cost you KRW 5,000. I have to warned you, it is not and easy tour, because you will hike up a small hill, do a lot of walking here. A good and comfy shoe will help you a lot. But do not worry so much because the guide is good enough to arrange sufficient stop for you to catch your breath. On top of that, if you are not able to finished your tour, just let her know, and she will point you the nearest exit to you.
Just for you to know, this Secret Garden is not actually a garden, it is more to a forest behind the palace. So, if visiting a beautiful forest is not your thing, don't go. As for me, it is worth a visit."
"Changdeokgung Palace is nice and worth a visit. Beautiful 14/15c architecture, many buildings and large grounds. The Gyeongbokgung Palace is definitely more impressive and worth spending double the time there. Beneficial to have a guide to bring the stories to life."
"The palace can be reached by subway line 3, Anguk Station. Take exit 3 and walk straight about 5 minutes.

The palace grounds are huge and there are a lot of buildings to see. However, unlike Gyeongbokgung, there are very few buildings with anything inside them. Definitely worth the visit but we didn't spend anywhere near the time we expected to there.

One note that if you go on a hot day, there is a lady who has a little kiosk on the street (about 1/3 of the way back to the subway) who sells beer and soft drinks. There are lots of benches nearby to enjoy your beverage."
"the secret garden is a real gem. you can only visit it with the guided tour (90 minutes, W5000), so make sure you're there in time to take it. the palace itself is beautiful, and is best seen independently (just use the guide provided for free at the entrance). if on tight schedule, this palace is a better choice than the larger-but-not-more-interesting Gyeongbokgung.
after your visit take a short walk to Insadong-gil for the tea houses, street food, and people-watching."
"Beautiful! We were there in the morning around 10.30 am on a weekend and it is not that crowded yet. The palace apparantly was used as the background for the K-drama Jang Ok Jung and I felt like I can hear the theme song in my head while I walked thru the palace ground (no kidding). So romantic. The Secret Garden you need to pay for a guide tour tour before you can access, so make sure you check with the ticket counter first before just buying just the entrance ticket. The mandarin speaking guide is so funny and we were so sad the tour ended. A must visit."
"Took a free guided tour offered by the city of Seoul and pleased that it was only the tour guide and myself. A lot of the buildings are closed to inside inspection, but the outside exteriors are impressive. They do offer guided tours in English during the day and my less than three dollar admission ticket was easily purchased."
The palace is interesting and in good condition. The best is the park being like a forest inside the city. It's quite and relaxing change comaparing to Seoul traffic.
Nice but nothing unique after seeing G- Palace. Look the same. Visit if you have time. Take a guide. No brochures or guidance available.
This place looks like you are in some kind of fairytale.Different architecture. Many colors and patterns.
"Booked an English guided tour of the Secret Garden, but you don't necessarily have to follow the guide if you prefer to explore around on your own. However, I wouldn't recommend that because it's quite interesting to know about the extra historical facts told by the guide.
Trees are everywhere in the palace which provide a good shade and cools the surroundings. Take your time to appreciate the natural beauty and architecture of the pavilions, gardens, ponds, etc."
"Would recommend the palace visit if you want to get a quick flavour of Korean history. Make sure you get a self guided booklet before you enter the grounds. Without it, you will not appreciate the significance of the palace. I know I have been there twice, the first time without the guide book."
"We went to the palace and secret garden on May 26, 2013. The English speaking guide was knowledgeable and was easy to understand. She did a good job at explaining royal life in the palace and its buildings. The tour lasted one hour which I considered appropriate. Then, we went to the second phase of the tour: the secret garden. The secret garden tour lasts 1.5 hours. You will see many pavilions and a lot of greenery. I found this part of the tour a let down as I was expecting more blooms and colors. Maybe there are more colors at a different time of the year. Meanwhile, the male guide was relatively easy to understand. He seemed to be pretty knowledgeable too. Overall, the secret garden tour was OK for a walking tour... Enjoyed the palace tour more... Happy travels!!"
Too little décor to review... perhaps more rooms with olden Korean equipment or pictures of emperors to be shown!!
Our first time here we were on a city tour and so our stop at this palace was too short! We came back the next day after booking the English walking tour of the Secret Garden which is incredibly expansive and takes up most of the grounds at the palace. I would highly recommend this tour for anyone who is interested in learning more about the architecture and history of not just this Palace but of the country and royal family. The secret garden is only open to those who are on the tour so make sure to book ahead of time!
"We visited the palace on a bloody hot day yet it was still a great experience. Better weather or season, then it'd be even better. Great history, tranquil atmosphere and beautiful palaces. Go for the combination tickets that will allow you to go to this palace, its secret garden, changgyeonggung palace, gyeongbokgung palace and yonmno shrine. Make sure you visit the Secret Garden located at the rear of the Palace - and you can only enter it by guided tours - there are 3 English tours / day - check the time table. To get to the palace, get to Anguk subway station."
"it not so far from Anguk subway station, you can have a english tour guide who will show you a palace with the history information."
"This palace is not the largest, but I would say prettiest as it contains the ""secret"" garden of the court. The entrance to garden is separate and has time limits, but it is beautiful."
"We were here for the blossoming of the azaleas, and the timing could not have been more perfect. This is a place where the weather matters a great deal to how much you will enjoy it. It's a wonderful green oasis on the outskirts of an enormous city. Bring extra batteries for your camera, and don't miss out on the Secret Garden. (And try to pop next door to the other palace too - they have a beautiful white greenhouse!)"
"This huge palace is set on almost 10 acres, it's a haven of tranquility in the middle of the city centre. There's a very nice little souvenir shop which sells items you will not find elsewhere.
The secret garden can only be visited with a guided tour so make sure to check the times table. It is absolutely worth it though, it's an amazing place full of history in a beautifull and tranquil setting."
"If you had to pick one palace to visit in Seoul, it should probably be Changdeokgung combined with the Secret Garden tour. A good afternoon plan would be to visit Changdeokgung, take the Secret Garden tour, and then continue into Changgyeonggung. You can get into Changgyeonggung directly from Changdeokgung (or vice versa).

Changdeokgung has beautiful palace grounds and buildings. You can choose to go on the tour or just wander around on your own. We actually started on the tour and let ourselves fall behind to continue on our own. Make sure to find out the times for the Secret Garden tour. As far as I know, they only let groups in at scheduled times for organized tours. You definitely don't want to miss that part. It's beautiful back there.

The cost is 3,000 KRW to enter Changdeokgung or 5,000 KRW including the Secret Garden. Like I said, go for the combination and make sure you know the Secret Garden tour start times. (And then after that, Changgyeonggung will cost you another 1,000 KRW to enter)."
"This is really a huge huge huge palace to cover which gives us a sense of tranquility when we are slowly taking in the magnificent sight of what it has to offer.
Did not take up the Secret Garden route though.
Just be prepared to have a solid pair of walking shoes to bring you around ^-^"
"If you have half day, it is a must to see in Seoul. Prepare to walk a lot and make sure the battery of camera is fully charged."
The tour groups are huge so very hard to hear what the tour guide is saying. The secret garden is the best part but be prepared to walk a lot. There are quite a few hills.
"I paid for the secret garden tour. It turned out to be a little disappointment as I visited the palace in early April in which the garden is full with deciduous trees. But the scenery is still great as building structure is really beautiful and it feels like you travel back in time. The tour guide did show to us how the secret garden looks differently in other seasons, seems like i have chosen the worst timing.

I signed up for a Chinese tour due to time convenience to visit the secret garden. I visited changdeokgung on the 6th day of my 7th day trip. In which, my leg is super tired and painful due to the non-stop walking, walking and walking for the past 5 days. I couldn't really follow the pace of the tour guide towards the end of tour and can't really listen to what he is talking though he is using a loud speaker.

So, I do advise everyone to wear their most comfortable shoes while visiting changdeokgung. Or maybe it's just my stamina problem?"
"I like this more than the popular Gyeongbokgung Palace. It's also an UNESCO site with less visitors.

Definitely worth seeing. There is Changchenggung right next to it but you must buy admissions separately.

Buget 2 hours for both palaces."
"Great place to visit! We went on a weekday so it was quite empty apart from a few tour groups. The building and grounds were amazing, well worth a visit. However, it was absolutely freezing when we went as it was snowing- so I would advise you to wear a few extra layers!"
we were there on a Sunday morning the climate was beautiful hence this palace is crowded We had to wait a little to get in Looking around the area the price of the ticket is worth In fact there is a separate ticket to Secret Garden OK. When you walk around you really feel the sadness of destruction of the palace in WW ii. If you time constrained and have little time to visit a palace then select this. I must mention the staff there are very courteous and helpful.
"If you do visit the secret garden or on a secret garden tour, and plan to visit any other palace or the shrine, it is well worth it to buy an integrated palace ticket which covers all 4 main palaces, secret garden and the shrine. Once you have that integrated ticket, and booked a secret garden tour, just go to the ticket booth about 10 feet from the secret garden entrance and show your reservation and exchange your secret garden entrance ticket from integrated ticket booklet to a tour ticket. Very painless.

The secret garden is worth a visit, and if you have the time and can visit at night, it sounds like it would be a great experience to visit the secret garden under the hanging lanterns. Ticket can be reserved online as well. The tour is about 1.5 hours and there is one part where you will be going uphill for a bit, so dress in your comfortable shoes. There is only 1 spot where there is bathroom once you started the tour, so place your break accordingly.

I personally can't keep this palace apart from the other palaces when I am looking at my pictures, except for the fact that this is the only palace that has a secret garden. All the ponds and reading places are interesting. You will also visit the area where the king and queen have their separate quarters, with a room for the King's mother in between their bedroom intriguing. (there is a back door for the king to visit the queen however)."
"Like most Western tourists, we have no particular interest in Korean architecture or history but as we were in Seoul we decided to experience and learn what we could and did the morning guided tour of the secret garden in English and then toured the palace buildings and grounds on our own afterwards.

It was a worthwhile visit and tour but not particularly captivating and not nearly as attractive as, say, the gardens we toured in Tokyo but certainly a good learning experience nonetheless.

We went to three palaces and unless I refer to the captions that I made in the photos, I have difficulty in telling one from the other and hence my ""one is enough"" comment."
"First of all, The visit of the palace area reminded me of the forbidden city. It is smaller of course but still very large. They say only 30% remains so perhaps it was as big.

The garden area visit was amazing a huge area of great beauty where ancient buildings blend perfectly with nature. I visited early May when many flowers were in bloom very pretty.

Now here is the secret: The garden area is not a garden it is a heavily forested area with ponds but no flower or Japanese style garden arrangements. Basically just beautiful unspoiled nature.

Perhaps you can all now help me with a question of my own: Why is this is not the number one attraction on TA?"
Since everything Korean was distroyed before during and after WW2 they are now rebuilding their heritage with greet result. I was here 10 years ago during winter and now it has gained so much more. The whole building layout is a bit sparse but that is probably the way it was. a must see
"Don't bother catching a guided tour. You can go without a tour and discover the palace on our own. Especially the secret garden, that's the best part, which you'll need 2000 more for that ticket but worth it.! beautiful gardens, definitely you should visit."
The only secret garden in the palace. This palace is about building it to suit the environment. I's almost like hiking a hill except there are pavilions and lotus pond around the area
"Joined the English speaking tour which was stultifyingly dull. The Temples all look the same pretty much, so once you've seen one, well.. the Secret Garden is very underwhelming, especially if you've been to Kyoto or any Japanese Garden. I preferred the other temple down the road."
"I visited this place on a very cloudy day, but the whole scenery was still graceful. Unlike Western architecture, this Korean architecture leaves a lot of space for gardens, and sometimes really just space. You can walk around and just absorb the atmosphere. I have been here twice already, and I still feel like the charm of this place does not fade away at all."
"it's a fascinating place. I like this place more than Kyongbok palace. because it has beautiful scenery in the city center of Seoul. you may experience hundreads years ago in the a modern city.
If you're staying at a hotel in Seoul. you can access there easily. let's say you're in the city hall, take a cab, it will take 10Mins around.
and Join English tour guide in the palace. it operates English tour guide a day. It tells you about history of palace. before you get there, check the time table, and visit 30Min before tour begins.
Otherwise you will have to face long queue and may lose a chance of sightseeing.
Still uncomfortable, make a phone call to the palace operator."
Kind of forbidden city in smallest scale. Very well conserved. Worth visiting the garden area for a fee.
"This is our second time to the palace.What makes it more exciting this time is our visit to the Secret Garden - the rear garden of the palace. We were unable to book an online reservation last year since the reservation page was not in English. This time, it is and reservation was a breeze. Entrance fee to the garden must be combined with the palace tour- very cheap at 9,000 won. We went much earlier than our 1130AM guided tour to the Garden. Presented our reservation confirmation form to the cashier, paid the fee and went around this beautifully-preserved Palace. Unlike our last year's rain-filled visit, the weather this time was sunny yet cool. 5 minutes after 1130, our big group was herded to the Garden. It was enchanting. The trees, flowers, ponds, a few structures- almost every spot is picture-worthy. Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful!"
"I'm writing this review because after reading Lonely Planet and looking at the palace website I was confused about the entry details and I would like to set them out clearly for others. The information about Changdeokgung in Lonely Planet is wrong – I doubt the person that wrote it has ever visited this site.

Palace grounds - you can see on your own, you do not have to go on a guided tour. However, free one hour guided tours of the palace grounds are available in a range of languages and I recommend that you go on one - the content is interesting and the guides are good.

Secret Garden - you can only gain access by going on a 90 minute guided tour. At the time of writing English language tours start at 11:30 AM, 1:30 PM and 3:30 PM. I reserved a place in advance through the palace website and when I bought the combination ticket on the day of the visit I gave the reservation printout to the ticket seller. The number of places is limited to 50 in each tour and mine was full so it is worth the effort of reserving in advance.

The Visit Seoul Bukchon Hanok Village walk starts near Changdeokgung and I combined the Secret Garden tour in the morning with the 2pm Visit Seoul walk. (Visit Seoul is listed in the Tripadvisor Seoul Things To Do / Activities page.)"
"the changing of guards ceremony made it interesting. other than that, there isn't much to see and do. the small eating places by the gate are reasonable and tasty,"
"The secret garden was the highlight of this palace for me. It cost a little extra for the tour, but they offer the tour in many different languages and your guild is well versed in the history of the palace. Don't miss this site on your Seoul tour!"
"Sadly, the Secret Garden was closed the day we visited. However, the remaining buildings and grounds were awe-inspiring and very fascinating. As other reviewers have said, it's interesting to consider the history of this palace and imagine the lives that were lived here hundreds of years ago.

Also fascinating is considering the contrast of modern Seoul as you take in the skyscrapers juxtaposed with the ancient palace.

It's worthwhile to pick up the English guidebook on your way in and read about each area as you explore."
"Although the locals seemed a little unenthusiastic about Changdeokgung Palace its a fantastic tourist destination. The government has poured millions into restoring this cultural icon and once you escape the crowds its a wonderful place to just wander around and soak up the atmosphere. Particularly good in May with all the blossom and flowers. Especially liked the water surrounded Gyeonghoeru Pavillion.

One last thing, it is currently free to enter the Palace (May 2013) in celebration of the successful completion of the latest phase of restoration."
"The palace itself was beautiful but nothing new if you've seen the other palaces in Korea.With that said, the highlight was definitely the secret garden tour. Our tour guide was very funny and I enjoyed historical context and insights into the architecture and design of the gardens. It's a lot of walking so make sure to where comfortable shoes!"
"I arrived just in time for an English language tour of the palace (just under an hour) followed by a 90 min tour of the ""secret garden"" and think I benefited from doing the tours as opposed to simply walking around n my own. In terms of what there is to see this wasn't the most interesting palace I have ever visited but there are some aspects that caught my attention eg the underfloor heating system, it's a good way to learn something about Korean history and it makes for a very pleasant couple of hours."
"As palaces go, the buildings at Changdeokgung are pretty average. But the blooming flowers were quite nice when I visited in May. The ""secret"" garden behind is also quite good. The term garden is misleading -- this looks nothing like Chinese gardens. Rather, it's a huge park tucked away behind the palace. In a crowded city that lacks trees and park space, the garden is a peaceful oasis from the noise and concrete that dominates most of Seoul."
"The old citadel of Seoul is wonderful place to visit. There are many old structures mixed with the new one. But everything brings inside Korean traditional style. In the main square of the palace, some time a traditional show with Korean traditional costumes. Please see my pictures to imagine the place."
"As I observe the massive structures, exquisite details, and massive stone-laid courtyard in this palace and remind my self that these Koreans created this thing many many years ago, I cannot help but feel awed by the greatness of past Korean Culture.

Take your time, walk slowly, observe, think.

Think about the minds that design this place, the fingers that draw every line, the hands that place every roof tile, the shoulder that carry the tools and the materials, the backs that bends to place every stone.

Think about the thousands of people who exist before you and how, through what they did, proof of their existence is still here.

Beauty that is distinct from other beauties.

I was awed by the unlimited creative potential of the human race."
"It is interesting to see how different the western version of royal living is from the eastern idea. Make sure to take the guided tours because as a westerner, nothing is what we are accustom to when we think of kings. The first tour is one hour and the garden tour takes an hour and a half. You will want more time to explore on your own though so plan accordingly."
You need to book reservations at least a day ahead to visit the Secret Garden on a guided tour. Excellent English guide. A strenuous walk up some mildly steep walk ways -- we walked a lot during the 90 minute tour covering wonderful pavillions 5-600 years old and a mini forest where the Joseon royalty relaxed.
"I found myself wandering round this place almost alone. Very colourful and picturesque, with some good photo opportunities. There was what appeared to be a throne room with warning signs on the steps up to it stating no entry [for what reason I know not] but that didn't stop the few tourists from ascending and the employee on guard took no interest. There's a ""secret garden"" tour that you can take, which I chose not to. A garden's a garden, and I have enough of my own at home already."
"Although we never got to the secret garden, it was in Changdeokgung where we saw a blooming Cherry Blossom. The sun was out and the weather was perfect.

Changdeokgung is one of the UNESCO heritage sites. It is accessible by bus or metro. The palace grounds was well-maintained. There was one hall that still had the furniture and the palace fixtures. In fact, the palace was livable till a few years ago.

There are also food stalls in the area of Changdeokgung. It is a walking distance to the Bukchon Hanok Village."
Very cool to see a 13th century palace smack in the middle of the city. The grounds are beautiful and there are a lot of other structures to see. Cost to enter is very minimal
Secret garden entry price is higher but worth the hike during spring be prepare to spend around 2 hrs on the guided tour.
"Just wondering how palace look like, that's why I came. You have to buy separate ticket to enter the secret garden. No secret at all, but it use to be royal member garden in old days. The secret garden ticket come with scheduled English guided tour. Be ready to walk around 1 hour 45 minutes with the tour guide. Last tour is 3:15pm. Palace area just cover around 40% of the whole palace area include garden. Advise to wear comfort shoes."
"The access old and young people had to the park. The architecture was stunning And of course, the cherry blooms"
"I'm a Korean, born in Australia. Been to Korea many times but went for the first time only recently.
I loved it. If you're going to go, you may as well go to the secret garden as well. Be sure to get there in time for a free guided tour around the palace. English tour times are 10:30am and 2:30pm."
"There are a couple of palaces in Seoul. Both are different enough to enjoy separately, but you must see at least one."
I got in on an English tour and learned a lot of this country. Be sure to go on The Secret Garden tour as well.
"The palace was really nice, and it's especially great if you make it in time to see the changing of the guard. If you are traveling with a young child, you can get a free stroller at the entrance so you don't have to bring your own. However, it isn't 100% wheelchair accessible, so for the parts where we had to climb steep stairs, we took turns going to see whatever there was to see."
Join the English guided tour at 10.30am it will give you a better appreciation of the history of this palace. If you like history you may wish to include the secret garden tour but there is a bit of walking and climbing of slopes so be prepared.
"First of all, this palace (like most others in Seoul) is a recreation as the originals were destroyed many years ago by the Japanese. However, that said, its still a very good way to spend a couple of hours to see what the palaces looked like back then. We took the English guided tour and the guide was very informative and helpful. We even did the Secret Garden tour and like it as some of the more scenic buildings (e.g. old library/reading room building) are included only if you take the tour. There are about 4 or 5 palaces within a small area of Seoul but I think this is the prettiest of them all so if you only have time to see one, this would be my recommendation."
"We visited this palace in early April and really enjoyed our time here. Having already walked around Gyeongbokgung a couple of days earlier, we decided to take both tour options. You can visit the palace without a tour but the secret garden is only accessible with a guided tour. There are 3 tours per day in English (the website is very good and gives full timings on everything). We got there about 5 minutes before the English tour of the palace started and managed to buy tickets and still be on time. Entrance fee is entirely reasonable, especially by UK standards.

The palace tour started promptly and the guide was certainly not hanging around. We were marshalled off, had brief stops at each of the main points and marched on again. I felt a bit herded about but still enjoyed learning a bit more about the palace and culture therein. The guide's English was excellent but you still need to ensure that you keep close enough (the different rhythm and pitch of Asian speakers means you have to concentrate to understand everything). The whole palace tour took just under an hour and finished right by the entrance to the secret garden.
The secret garden tour started just after the palace tour finished. There were far more people in this tour than in the palace tour so I suspect not everybody went for the palace tour beforehand.
The guide's English this time was even better than the first one. In addition, we were given time at several stops to take photos, take in the scenery and just take things a bit slower.
The secret garden tour took the full 1.5 hours and by the end of it our two daughters were both a bit bored. However, this was largely due to the fact that it was only 8 degrees and drizzling. Having spent 2.5 hours outside, we were all getting very cold (despite wearing winter coats and gloves) so I suggest you dress up warm if visiting outside summer.
I would definitely recommend this place. The garden in particular is beautiful and you really wouldn't notice that you are in the middle of a busy city. Guides are very informative.
If you want to warm up afterwards, I would recommend the Nescafe Cafe across the road - very warm and the coffee is good too."
"We visited the two major palaces of Gyeongbokgung and Changdeokgung on one day, and the latter was far more impressive for its history and heritage, well qualified for enlisting as a UNESCO world heritage site. Our visit was made all the more interesting and informative by a well-experienced guide who was fluent in her command of English and managed to cover the massive ground in an hour.

The heritage design and architecture of the palace came across vividly as a visual presentation of the Korean history. As an ethnic Chinese, one could not but be amazed by the wide use of traditional Chinese characters for designated palaces and literary arts of display, and wondered at the historical link between the two countries. Indeed, there was even the feeling that the design layout of the Forbidden City in Beijing was being modelled here.

There was a separate visit to the Secret Garden which we also took; but that came through as a disappointment. Our early arrival just before the spring cherry blossom might have accounted for the lacklustre scenary; but the absence of landscaping and plain layout of the ponds as their centre-piece came out far behind the serenity and tranquility of neighbouring Chinese and Japanese gardens. Indeed, we abandoned the trip (which costed more than the visit to the palace) less than half way through.

I would suggest fo first time visitors: Go for the palace but not the gardens."
"Beautiful UNESCO world heritage palace, and rear garden with pond, seamlessly integrated with the natural topography. Nice and peaceful place to visit during a stay in Seoul."
"huge, very impressive. the architecture was very amazing , Elaborate roof designs, there were numerous school children on field trips; they were delightful and wanted to practice their English. Seeing their interest in their country's history was refreshing."
"This is a nice and smaller place amongst the others. It is UNESCO world heritage listed as it is said to have been note grated and set amongst nature.

It has some nice elements of beautiful trees and also not as busy as Gyeonbokung .. Good to have some time to enjoy, reflect and step away from the hustle and bustle of Seoul."
Visit this palace and join the Secret Garden tour. The tour lasts for 1.5 hours. There are several tours with several languange every day.
"The park is very beautiful, and definitely worth seeing. The tours are very good, but they they about one hour, so make sure to schedule when you go. The price is very cheap, so if you have the time, this is a must-see."
In the middle of a concrete city lays a variety of beautiful palaces that are laced with history and distinction. Do not miss visiting this palace during your time in Seoul.
The Secret Garden is the best kept attraction in this place. Can be seen only as a guided tour. Take any language tour if time is a constraint as all places have detailed English signs and detailed descriptions of the locations and the significance.
"I did both the palace tour and the Secret Garden tour. I liked them both and got a lot out of each but there was some overlap, so I might recommend just picking one. The Secret Garden is available only by tour, so maybe that one... Plan to walk a lot and learn quite a bit about Korean history."
"We chose to visit on a Thursday to avoid the compulsory guided tours on other days, but this was a disappointing visit. It is touted in many guides as the must-do palace to visit in Korea, but we found the place lacks atmosphere, and looks like a large empty film set. The following day we visited Gyeongbokgung Palace which is much more impressive, and would be the palace we would recommend of the two ""big ones"". This palace is at Anguk station, Line 3, Exit 3."
"It is amazing how the structures were well preserved. Palace tour that started at 10:30am took an hour with an English speaking tour guide. One should join a guided tour to truly appreciate everything you'd see and start your imagination on how it was for the king, queen and others. It is unbelievable to see the original bridge (abt 600 yrs old) that connects the palace to the outside. One will be surprised to see and know how and why the rooms of the king and queen are such. Will not elaborate on this so that you'd get the surprise as well.

The Secret Garden tour is an independent tour that immediately followed the palace tour. The Secret Garden is the palace's garden. It took another 1 1/2 hours to cover the whole area. Had another lady tour guide who speaks english very well. Could have been as good as the palace tour but since the group was so large (at least 70 persons), it was difficult to be near her at all times. Thus, we missed the information she gave for a particular area or so of the garden. It would have been better if there were several english speaking guides and divide the group.

I would recommend both tours."
"If the weather is good, this is the most relaxing and quiet place ever. Although it's in the middle of a bustling city, it is amazing that this national landmark has been kept so well. You can go walk around and learn about Korea's history, relax in the many sitting areas, and maybe even have a mini picnic under a tree. Highly recommend to wear comfy shoes and pack some snacks."
"It was great to drop by here. Although, I have to admit it wasn't all that impressive. I was more impressed with the Secret Garden tour, and would rate that separately, if I can. It is beautiful and old, but I would say not very well kept, maybe because of its ground coverage.what I loved most about this place was the beautiful ceilings they had and how beautiful the stone walls looked. A good 1 hour or less even for the palace grounds would be the time limit I've give on this."
"lovely buildings and a great place to walk around and get some cool photos. you dont really need a guide, but there are some tours if you wish - just take note of the times in advance as they are not that frequent. Especially if you need one in english - most are in japanese."
"Next to Gyeongbokgung, this palace is relatively smaller. What it lacks in size, though, it makes up in face value. Changdeukgung Palace is by far prettier and has more fascinating nooks. Take the guided tour through the Secret Garden for 8,000 won to see some of the more fascinating landmarks and learn more about the Joseon Dynasty's history. The tour takes about 90 minutes and runs at certain times of the day for certain languages. It takes a lot of walking, though, and may require a bit of a hike on an incline. The view is really pretty, though."
"Interesting to see. Well preserved, clean and beautiful.

The english tours are very limited. We arrived at 1115am. We just missed the 1030am tour and the next one was at 230pm. We could not go into the secret garden without a tour guide. The only English tour was at 330pm. You only need about 30-45 minutes to walk through the palace."
"Beautifully restored palace. They have a good online website which details the times of the various guided tours (english, Japanese, Chinese) which is complimentary on purchasing a entry ticket.

Try and organise a tour which is followed by a tour of the secret garden which would have been much more beautiful in spring or summer (spring was still 2-3 degrees when we were there this year)

I thought that the tour was a bit rushed - there were quite a lot of parts to cover in a relatively short span of time. However, it was an informative and interesting tour."
Very huge compound... should have a tour guide while visiting this place or else you wont understand a thingy... perhaps if you really a Korean movie fan you might have some idea what you looking at.
"Easy to navigate around the palace with free guided tour in either English/Chinese/Japanese/Korean and free map is available. However, you may find the area (regular tour, cost: 3000 won) small unless you buy the entrance ticket to secret garden (5000 won)."
"the walking tour to secret garden was a lil bit hard, especially for older ppl. i wouldnt do that twice for sure"
The place appeared much bigger than Gyeongbokgung but a lot of the rooms are empty. We didn't get to visit the Secret Garden because a tour guide is required to enter the Secret Garden. Note English speaking tour guide finishes around 2.30pm
"Most of my time here was spent on the tour of the Secret Garden. The admission to the palace was five dollars and the tour just three dollars. I loved the Secret Garden! I was amazed at how large it was, the tour takes 90 minutes. English tours are limited, so I recommend coming early. It's like a living history lesson learning about the kings and their lives. I did not take the palace grounds tour, but I've no doubt it would be interesting."
"It's really nice visiting this palace.
I was so interested since watching the korean film and visiting this palace is like dream come true.
Ou tour leader informing their tradition, we took picture wearing the traditional dress.
Overall were great!!!!"
DOnt forget to visit the Secret Garden which can only be seen through guided tour (90 minutes). Its not as big as Gyeongbukjung Palace but you can see its great restoration
"Of the 5 Palaces in Seoul, the Changdeokgung Palace was on top of my list of must-see attractions because of its UNESCO World Heritage listing. I joined a day tour in February that took us around the Insadong-gil area and the Changdeokgung Palace. It was unfortunate that we visited on a cold, rainy day, making it quite a challenge to do a walking tour (the grounds quickly got muddy). Nonetheless, we persevered and this attraction did not disappoint. The buildings inside the Palace complex have been beautifully restored. It's well-worth a visit, but to fully appreciate the beauty of this site, make sure you check the weather forecast before venturing out. Since I went with a group, we were able to get a discounted entrance fee of KRW2,400 (regular price is KRW3,000)."
The Changdeokgung Palace is within walking distance of the Noble Hotel and is the best preserved of the six palaces in Seoul. This is apparently the place where the last king and queen of Korea was killed by the Japanese during their invasion. It is a must see if you are in Seoul.
"Although we went it in late february, the scenery and housing was amazing. I would like to go back in the spring to see all the water features!"
"The standard ticket only gives you access to the main buildings of the palace. However, if you include a guided tour of the Secret Gardens, you get to see the rest of the palace which is beautiful. (total cost is 8,000Won per adult). You can only visit the Secret Gardens via a guided tour which is about 1.5 hours. English language guided tour of the Secret Gardens is only at 10.30am and 2.30pm."
"We walked along Insadong's main street and, while having lunch in Insadong, we realised from the map that Changdeokgung Palace was actually quite close to Insadong. We asked at the Tourist Information Office just to make sure. It took us about 10 minutes to get from Insadong to Changdeokgung Palace. I do recommend making this palace part of your itinerary if you are visiting the Insadong area or Jongmyo Shrine (another UNESCO World Heritage).
Changdeokgung is quieter and more peaceful compared with the huge Gyeongbokgung Palace. We visited during the new year holidays and there was no guided tour for the architecture part, so we only took the guided tour of the Secret Garden in English. Check out the tour schedule before you visit to benefit more out of your walking thru the palace. There's a Nescafe coffee shop opposite the entrance of the palace, across the road. Handy if you want some caffeine or if you want to rest your legs before or after visiting the palace."
"With so much of Seoul focused on the modern, this palace complex was a welcome view into the past.
Free guides in multiple languages point out key points and very helpful."
Staying nearby in Insadong it was a 15 min walk to the palace (the only one of the 5 palaces awarded UNESCO heritage status) on a cold but stunningly clear day. We went during the Chinese New Year celebrations which meant not all the guided tours were available but we paid W3000 to take the palace tour at our own leisure. Given the holidays it was short on visitors which ensured there was a quiet and regal reverence to our ambling from one impressive building to the next. There is limited access to the interior of many of the buildings but just from the outside you get strong sense of some of the pageantry of Korean tradition and the buildings have been kept immaculately. I can imagine that at spring this would be an even greater time to come when the Secret Garden and flora and fauna are in full bloom. With the rocky crags of the mountains as a backdrop then it makes for some great photo opportunities as well.A memorable attraction.
"You may see the life of both royal families and peers of Chosun dynasity. The buildings for royal family and the house for kings' wives except queens are built one by one in this palace.
This palace has different characteristics from other palaces in Chosun dynasity. Some part of the palace had very simmilar uses as Harem in Topkapi Palace in Istanbul.
This site is very close to Insa-Dong Street. You may come to this palace in 5 minutes from An-Guk station of No.3 (Orange) subway line."
"we stayed near this palace and visited. The entrance fee was also not so high from the European standard, but we enjoyed half day there"
A Palace in the middle of the city! This place has been maintained well. Its huge so wear some good walking shoes. The garden is another attraction (extra fee) but worth it.
"The most beautiful place in Seoul is Changdeokgung palace. I recommend you to spend at least 2 hours to visit this place with many building and history. The main palace is the most beautiful, if you want the perfect picture go to right side where traveler and guide there. it is the best spot for shooting."
"It reminded me of the forbidden city in Beijing. Beautifully laid out, stunning craftsmanship, interesting history and incredible location with the hills in the background."
"The best part of the palace was the free English-speaking guide (several times a day). The palace itself has some pretty architecture but a lot has been rebuilt over the years. There is the palace tour at W3,000, plus the HIdden Garden tour at + W5,000. If you're here on winter day I don't recommend the Garden tour, there are some nice gardens to see but not really extraordinary."
"I think if you only get to visit one palace in Seoul, you should visit Changdeokgung Palace. Go on the guided tour of both the main palace and the Secret Garden. The English speaking guide is really good, and gave a lot of good information on the palace and the culture. She gave us ample time to take pictures too. We learned a lot about Joseon Kings and what happened in Korea’s history in our 90 minute tour.

The Palace is also right beside the Bukchon Traditional Hanok Village. There you can see the traditional Korean houses, participate in Korean handicraft classes, learn to make kimchi and wear a hanbok. So you could probably arrange your day so that you can go to the Palace and Bukchon all in one day to drink in the culture of old Korea."
"Maybe I didn't enjoy it so much because it was freezing the day I visited the palace and all I wanted just hot drink, I still see it as interesting place.."
".We went on the English speaking tour at 2:30 pm on a cold day. The tour guide thought it was a warm day at 32 degrees fahrenheit (0 Celsius). I've been to other palaces before, but this was the first one that I had a tour guide. It truly enhances your experience to have someone give you background information about the history and culture and you'll appreciate the palace grounds more. The buildings are beautiful and a photographer's dream. There is a lot of walking involved because this place is big so wear comfortable shoes. It is not paved in most areas you are touring and you'll walk up steps and uneven ground. They have modern restrooms and a small cafe with hot and cold drinks if you need to take a break. The entrance fee is very reasonable, only $3 for the palace tour and $8 for both the palace and secret garden tour. The guide books and internet said that one of the English speaking tours was at 1:30 pm but when we arrived, it was at 2:30 pm. I don't know if they changed their schedule permanently or it was just that day"
"We came in December, winter season with -3'C weather, and a senior citizen, so we were not able to cover a lot of areas. We still had a lot of photo ops. It might be better to visit during spring or autumn though."
In general we are not so keen on tours but the palace tour in English was really interesting and due to our humerous tour guide very amusing. Without her we would just have taken some pictures of the place and left again. But the one hour tour gives you a better insight and knowledge about the daily live on the palace premises in ancient times. We enjoyed it and would recommend it. We skipped the Secret Garden tour though as we only had a few hours in Seoul but can imagine that this is also a great tour in spring and summer without the snow we had now in January.
"This palace is really cool to see and has some awesome Korean history, but everything is outside, so make sure you go on a good, comfortable weather day. I went during the winter and it was miserable."
despite a lot of tourists and locals all around there's places to enjoy the solitude. also the secret gardens worth the walk
"Everything was blanketed in a beautiful layer of snow when we went which made for some lovely photos. To go into the Secret Garden, you have to follow a tour. So make sure you check tour times. Otherwise you can only access the palace buildings in front (which was what we did)."
"the back yard of Changdeokgung, cost 8,000WON per person, worth going.all kiosks were designed differently, rooms designed with multi functions. its winter and it all covered by snow, but you could still imagine it was ever prosperously developed."
"Just fine. The palace was a mirror of their cultural background. Not much to see here, but if you're into their culture you can pay a visit here too"
"It is quieter and less crowded than Gyeongbukgung, but offered much more scenery. Please please please go for the Secret Garden (Huwon) tour within the palace. I went during winter, even though it was freezing cold, the scenery made everything worthwhile."
"very nice palace to spend a day there. easy access. Buildings and places are well maintained, worth to have a visit at this palace."
"I have been to Gyeongbokgung twice since it is the biggest palace in Seoul. However, not until i visited Changdeokgung one autumm morning, have i changed my mind.
The secret garden (huwon) in Changdeokgung is magnificent during autumm with the autumn trees in the surrounding."
"Beautiful enchanting gardens are the words that I could think of to describe the Changdeokgung Palace. It was my first day in Seoul and the uninviting rains kept me from going around during the morning but come afternoon, I decided not to waste the day by walking to this palace. The Secret Garden is amazing. With the burst of hues and wonderful structure, I immediately regained my will to go around and explore. The place is very photogenic."
"Maybe it was a winter thing, or they were doing a lot of construction but half the palace was closed. The area I could see was nice though, but I'd like some sort of sign saying it was closed so I could chose to skip it this time and come back another time (might still go back, its only 3000)"
"Changdeokgung is a bit different to some of the other palaces you can visit in Asia as it's configuration was not as formal and rigid as some others. A great place to explore and appreciate some of the history of the Korean Royal Dynasty. Shame you need to go on a guided tour of the Secret Garden, would prefer to just wander around."
"I went to this place on a whim and found it breathtaking. I highly recommend the ""Secret Garden"" tour but you have to book that in advance. I was lucky to find a tour guide who had extra tickets and was willing to sell me one for original price, not scalped. I also went in the fall and the leaves were BEAUTIFUL!"
"Very nice visit of a well preserved / re-buildt palace. In fact, it is quite huge, and if you are interested in korean history, you can spend the whole day, without being bored!"
"A visit to the Palace provides a good way to learn about the final Royal Dynasty in Korea, the unique archictecture, and the central role of Buddhism in Korean Society. The ""Secret Garden"" is not open all the time but is well worth a visit as well"
"This was the only palace I visited in Seoul - it covers a large area, including the Secret Garden. You can only enter the Secret Garden with the guided tours (which are done in Korean, Japanese, English...etc?). Check online for the tour schedule. To enter, you will need to buy a pass with the Secret Garden entry.

We were on a tight schedule, so we went with the Japanese guided tour (even though we didn't understand Japanese!), as we had just missed the English one. The Secret Garden is the filming location for a few internationally famous Korean drama series - the tour will include points of interest (if it's the Chinese and Japanese tour, as many Chinese and Japanese are hooked on Korean drama!)

There are many buildings in the garden - the servants quarters and small lakes. The surroundings are very peaceful - it's a very relaxing stroll through beautiful scenery.

A word of advice : Wear comfortable shoes and a hat. You'll be walking for more than an hour, if you want to cover the whole palace grounds."
"Although it was winter, the sun that came up on the day we went was just perfect! The trees on the grounds were blooming in beautiful colors - green, yellow, orange and red!! We had a great time just scouting the grounds and admiring the old palace grounds."
"Just like may other Korean palaces, we find this place interesting, but looking the same after awhile. Due to time constraints, we didn't manage to visit the Secret Garden (apparently the king hung out here), Big regret! We read reviews and realised that this is the main attraction of Changdeokgung.

Super near our guesthouse, like 5 minutes!"
"We bought the 4-Palace pass so we saw all of them and we liked Changdeokgung the best. It's a nice complement to Gyeongbokgung Palace (where you might pick up more Korean history and culture since it has two museums there). However, Changdeokgung was our favorite because the gardens in fall colors were magnificent. Do take the Secret Garden (Biwon) tour, being prepared for walking short hills. There you will see a multitude of small structures, water,
and views that delighted the royals. I don't believe they have a changing of the guard ceremonies like we saw at two other palaces, but purely for beauty you can't compare."
changdeokgung is a palace where king Sejo built a garden as a resting place for the royale family. i went there when the trees changed color so it was really beautiful. you have to pay for an extra fee if you want to enter the secret garden but it was worth it. should look up a schedule for the free tour around the palace that they provided so you can get a better grasp about the historical of the palace.
"I had booked for an English tour that includes the Changdeokgung & Secret Garden. I gotta say that I'm amazed by the beauty of that place. I visited Changdeokgung just before winter and managed to experience a combination of beautiful autumn leaves and frozen lakes. Despite the tiring walk, all exhaustion was forgotten when I'm mesmerized by dream-like sceneries and architectures. Inside the Secret Garden is definitely way colder than the outer places! If you have the time, the tour is a good experience & your only way to get a glimpse of the secret garden.. ;)"
Great rebuilt palace. But do not miss the Secret Garden which is not too secret. If the weather is wet do not wear good shoes. Muddy!
"This palace, the secondary residence of the Josun dynasty, has a less regular layout and better conforms to the ground and the surrounding. It is also more simple then the main palace and for this reason it has a quite beauty. The secret garden is a must visit."
"I really like in this palace. We got to see the old Korea! Well-preserved houses. I was able to see the bed of the queen of the Joseon Dynasty and the king's throne.=)

We went also to the Secret Garden. Well, it was a garden that is as big as a forest! Yes. A little bit tiring to walk around especially when you pass by the steep slopes. But it is a good place to take pictures and to imagine how the Korean royalties spent their free time. You can also see the maid's head quarters that are really small. We chose not to have a guide since we want to spend our time taking pictures.haha.

A must see for Traditional Korean Drama lover! I love this place! =)

**TIP: Try the bean cake and the fish cakes that the ahjumma sells outside the changdeokgung palace (near the ticketing booth). The bean cake is so yummy! We bought 50pcs (5pcs/ 1000 won)!"
"I visited when the trees had turned color, so the views were full of amazing colors. Many of the buildings have been reconstructed after various Japanese invasions and destructive fires, and as is typical of Korean buildings are rather austere, with emphasis upon natural elements, such as ""scholar trees,"" interesting volcanic rocks and a 700-year-old Juniper tree. There are some heartbreaking stories attached to the final Korean residents of these structures, after the Japanese had taken over the country, displaced the monarchy and turned Koreans into abused and scorned subjects. However, the simple beauty of these buildings and more importantly the attached ""Secret Garden"" with its small pavilions situated among natural springs, pools and former waterfalls in a sort of enchanted Eden (only for the enjoyment of royalty at that time) is worth the effort to be there on Thursday when tours are available. English language tours were at 11 and 3:30 p.m. There are other language tours throughout the day. All the main Korean palaces are in relative proximity to each other, although it doesn't seem that way based on the subway stations each one needs. For example, at the entrance to the ""Secret Garden"" is the back entrance to another palace (costing only 1,000 won to visit) Changgyeonggung. The main hall was rebuilt in 1616 and is the oldest extant hall in Seoul. It's not a large palace, having been built for dowager queens, but I witnessed an older Korean woman who was clearly praying at both the main hall and the several wells located in the precincts, so the site has special significance for some. If you arrive early for the ""Secret Garden,"" spend an hour visiting this palace and looking at 400-year-old wooden beams in the main hall."
I think this is the best looking palace of the many in Seoul. I enjoyed it very much. Very well kept and does not take too much time to get through the whole thing.
"This is one of the highlights of ancient Korea, amazingly to be found in the city centre - don't miss the Secret Garden, take a tour and immerse yourselves in the romantic history of the Dynasties ..."
"This is the second palace visited on a Saturday (after Gyeongbokgung Palace) and is the only World Heritage Site of the 4 palaces. Arrived around 1pm and spent about an hour here following the numbering of the buildings in the provided brochure. Ticket costs KRW3000 (~USD2.70) with an additional fee to visit Huwon. If one is keen to see this ""Secret Garden"" then advanced booking is best. It seems the regular ticket will allow one to see many structures in this palace complex, but cover less than half of the area (Huwon is rather large).

The brochure which came with the ticket is an excellent one and quite sufficient for navigating through the complex, with rather substantial information for identifying unique features of the buildings and understanding the architecture. Changdeokgung minus Huwon seems much smaller than Gyeongbokgung and takes a shorter time to visit. However after seeing much in Gyeongbokgung, this required a bit more effort to appreciate. Also, worth noting is that the crowds seemed unavoidable here, probably due to the small size of Changdeokgung, the fact that it was visited later in the day and on a weekend.

Thought the blue tiled roof of Seonjeongjeon was rather unique, but personally found the Nakseonjae Complex stood out the most because of its simplicity, reflecting the character of the King who lived here.

Overall, a very good visit to Changdeokgung, and a worthy inclusion to exploring Seoul. Note that this palace is closed on Mondays. Also there is a month-valid combination ticket to visit the other three palaces and Jongmyo shrine nearby. These are all within walking distance but would be rather difficult to properly appreciate in one full day.

If coming by metro, Changdeokgung is accessible by Line 3 (Anguk station) Exit 3."
"The Changdeokgung Palace is very close to the subway station, with 1-2 mins walk. The Palace is an ordinary one, if you expect a grand palace, Changdeokgung will make you disappointed. There is a Secret Garden inside the Palace, you need to buy another ticket for it, but I think the garden is not so interesting, compare to the imperial garden in China or Europe. The Changdeokgung Palace is a good place to know more about the Korean history, so if you haven't been there, it is worth to visit."
"Occasionally organizers plan a moonlight tour of this palace. The palace itself is wonderful and even if its not the night tour you will still enjoy your time. If you have the chance to do the moonlight tour, even though it is much more expensive (30,000 won) it is totally worth it. They tour you around the grounds and at the end there is an amazing performance of traditional Korean music, dance, and singing."
"Must be the size of the place. It's much smaller compared to Gyeongbokgung. And you definitely must try and fit in for a guided tour. Otherwise, it is boring by just looking at the structure of the buildings which are similar to the ones in the other palaces without the storyline."
"The palace is beautiful, full of colors and history. The secret garden is beautiful and worth seeing. You can only enter the secret garden with guided tour. Best to check the tour time before hand if you are planning on visiting the secret garden. The tour times are different for different languages."
"its a very beautiful palace, its a must see, nice gardens and open places, there is even a museum inside which is worth a see, taking a guided tour can be a good option to understand the culture better."
"This palace is smaller than Gyeongbokgung but has the secret garden. The garden is via guided tour only whereas you are free to visit the palace at your own pace or via tour as well.

I recommend you take one of the palaces free guided tours so you can appreciate the significance of the architecture and culture of Korea. Once you have done that, it can be translated across any other palace you may choose to visit.

In autumn, with the leaves the garden was beautiful and a must see. There is about 45-60 minutes worth of walking in the tour and the guide we had gave us about 5 or so minutes at each point to take pictures.

Really the fee is minimal, the combined ticket 10 000 won ($9 US) is really cheap and you can see the 4 palaces, secret garden and jongmyo shrine as well."
A step back in time to a classic era...the palace and grounds are a must see. Just walking around the manicured parks you can get a real flavour of times passed and the culture that surrounds you.
Beautiful surroundings and buildings...very similar to China palaces. Would really have loved to go in the Secret Garden but you need to be part of a guided tour to do this...why? Visited in November and the tree colours were spectacular...just wished we could have got full access.
This palace reminded me of New York City's Central Park. We rented ear buds and a device that explains the palace when you put a stylist on a picture. Watch out--the Korean school kids visiting on field trips all want to practice speaking English.
"This was the best Korean palace because of the secret garden area. Most palaces in Seoul are restored and not the original place, so it can feel very artificial and too open. Changdeokgung was the best because of the trees and ponds in their garden. The changing leaves in autumn were beautiful and really enhanced the little pavilions and original buildings in this palace."
I prefer this palace to all the other palaces due to its interesting layout as well as its secret garden which was breathtakingly beautiful in the autumn. But do note that some parts of the tour require walking up steep slopes.
"Beautiful palace with a lot of trees. We went in November and the colors of the trees were spectacular. It is a peaceful place no outsides noises. We were there quite early and almost nobody was there. There is a nice cafe and a souvenir shop. Overall it is well preserved palace, lots of colors. You can not compare it to the palaces in China, but still a visit worth while.
Easy to reach with the subway, exit Jongnam- 3 or Anguk. entree fee was 3000 won.
But to go to the secret garden without a tour guide was not possible. There is an extra fee for the garden. You can buy a palace-ticket for 10.000 won, and you can see all the palaces."
The guards at the palace are merely actors who help to re enact the scene during the.ancient time. Changing of Guards are on display every hourly.the Park is beautiful during autumn.
"This palace, now reconstructed, was built during King Joseon's reign in the 14th century. It served as 2nd palace from where he ruled while the rest of his relatives lived in Gyeongbokgung.It lacks the historical artifacts normally found in most palaces in Asia."
"I've been there for over 3 times. It's full of beautiful and stunning colours during autumn, green, red, yellow and orange around. I really enjoyed the secret garden, the rear part of the palace, quiet and peaceful environment, very good for a short walk and photo shooting. The palace provided scheduled guide tour with different languages, such as Korean, Mandarin, English and Japanese."
They have free guided tours in English but U need to be there before 2pm to catch the guide. Other languages available too at various times. Can visit the nearby Bukchon Village & Samcheong-dong area after U r done with this
Clever and sensitive use of its topography. Beautiful fall colors. Could do with more English signage.
"This is the second palace built in the 1400s. May of these buildings were also destroyed by the Japanese in 1910, but several also survived, and this is the complex that the last King and his court occupied before the demise of the empire with the invasion by Japan.
The building style is very similar to the 1st palace, Gyeongbukgung, but has several interesting features, including in-floor heating systems and the Secret garden. The English tour was worth it (no real extra cost)."
"I love this palace out of all the other palaces. You must not miss this one.
It's Secret Garden is a must visit. If you like having pretty backdrop for photos, Secret Garden's the one for you.
TIP1: English tour for Secret Garden is at 11am and 3:30pm but you can avail of the self-guided tour. You can roam around without all the other people. Plus, you can enter anytime.
TIP2: From Changgyecheong, there's an exit going directly to here. So you may go to both palaces in one day."
"Changdeokgung has a lot to offer, from the palace itself to it's Secret Garden (Huwon). It's better to set a leisure pace for this than breeze through the complex. Secret Garden was my priority when I came here. When I tried to make the reservation for the Secret Garden a day before, I was told that the reservation for my planned day was already full 2 weeks before (this reservation is for the guided tour). The lady was kind enough to let me know that I can still go into the garden without the tour, which I'm very grateful for. So, for those that unable to make the reservation, don't fret. You can still go in and maybe just tag along behind the guided tour group once you are pass the entrance."
"Lived in Korea from 9/1995 - 9/1997 and visited this palace and the secret garden back then. It is nice to see that the place is as nice, if not nicer. Take your best camera and good walking shoes. The tour to the secret garden runs about every hour. Unless you are a history buff and need ALL the details, I suggest you sign up for the next available tour and when you enter the Secret Garden area you can just leave the group behind and stroll at your own pace."
"The palace is uniquely Korean with architectural features worth admiring, including below floor heating. Geometric building features and colorful painting of eaves and external woodwork are to be admired. If possible, get a tour guide. See also the Secret Garden, which has English guided tours."
"The Changdeokgung is a magnificent example of Royal Palaces and buildings. A good couple of hours is needed to do the complex justice. For a slightly higher entry fee, the gardens are well worth visiting."
"Seoul tourism board arranged two special tours for tourists in October. You can walk around the ""secret places"" in the palace with tourguide, There's a traditional Korean show at the end. You will also receive souvenirs re the palace and Korea.
Don't miss it !"
"Old palace, offering tour guide! A must see if you want cultural tour."
"This is where the Korean royal family lived from the sixteenth century until 1989. You have to visit as part of a guided tour. Don't worry, they have tours in English. The palace is also a UNESCO World Heritage Sight."
"The palace is a great place to visit. I may not know what the history was behind it, but they were terrific buildings and just being in the middle of a major city but sneaking away to a peaceful area was quite nice. We took the walking tour. The woman was sort of difficult to understand but her English was correct. There were almost 100 people in the tour group. Be aware it is quite a walk. The tour talks about male dominance in the culture and how that is reflected in the architecture. Also be aware that the tour guide that we had wouldn't let us leave early. After 40 minutes, we got kind of bored with the walking tour. She won't let you leave the group, even if it is to go to the bathroom! It isn't the most entertaining walking tour but it is a beautiful place to visit.

Useful tip: bring some a drink. The gift shop is over priced. There are many mini-marts all around the area. This place is very easy to get to via subway/bus."
"First things first - you *must* go on a tour to see the secret garden. Look up the tour times and plan to get there in advance to secure a spot in the limited-party group. English tours, for example, are only twice a day when I went... and I missed them. (I should have snuck into Japanese tour with my elementary school vocabulary, but I just missed it...)

This palace has a very similar feel to Gyeongbokgung, but I think it's worth the visit. The topology of the area is different so the layout is different. I didn't notice an audio guide available, but the written guide was really great. This palace also backs directly into Changgyeonggung Palace, so it's easy to knock out two at once!

In the early afternoon, after plenty of walking, I dropped into the Nakseonjae Complex in the back part of the grounds and took a seat in the courtyard. It was such a peaceful place, resting on the stone step, soaking up the stories that must have taken place here hundreds of years ago. (Or even back in the 80's when the wife of the last crown prince lived there!)"
"In my last trip here was my first place that making my first impression was outstanding!!! it's amazing how they can maintain such a big palace with the huge garden( for me can be even small beautiful forest ) in the middle of civilised capital. Basically in the palace combined with 2main sections which is the palace and the secret garden(Suwon). I'd love to recommend wearing comfortable shoes and outfits, be ready to climb up and down some hills in the secret garden that u might skip if u have elders or small kid(Trolley can get through around 90% of the garden with some slopes). There is a guide tour for the secret garden with choices of either english or korean languages, only one thing that bothering me was tour guide she has such a perfect english great knowledges but not the politeness. Anyway overall is gorgeous palace, it's a must to place in Seoul!!!!"
The one thing that I wanted to visit whilst in Korea were the palaces as it brings so much history to the city. I wasnt disappointed when we went to visit and we managed to see the Changing of the guards too.
Great place to visit when you're in Seoul. You feel the quiet right in the middle of the bustling ciy. You imagine how Yi dynasty royalty and entourage felt here.
"This one is nice and set in a peaceful park. Very similar to the main Royal Palace. If you've seen that one and don't have a lot of time, you could probably skip this one."
"For somewhat who is interested in East Asia history, one must visit this palace. There is a very real difference between Chinese and Korean royal buildings. Korea's last dynasty Joseon, was Confucian in principle and practice, and I might add far more Confucian than later dynasties in China (where Confucianism originated).

This difference is apparrent in palace architecture and royal tombs. While the Forbidden City Palace is perhaps the most grand palace in the world, Changdeokgung is rather simple, not in a bad way. This is by design. Moreover, while Chinese tombs were designed often as monumental structures by the Emperor destined to abide there, in Korea the view was different.

Joseon strictly adhered to Confucian princliples, which are very concerned with humility, filial devotion, and the dignity of simplicty. Therefore, concerning palace and tomb architecture it was ideal to construct buildings that showed the dignity and honour of the dynasty, but equally important was humility in design. Feng Shui was also far more important than grandiosity, much time was spent by geomancers to select the best location for royal palaces or tombs. Changdeokgung is considered one of the finest locations of any building in Korea.

Changdeokgung encapsilates this philosphy better than any other Korean palace, and this is one reason it is a Unesco World Heritage site. For 288 years Changdeokgung was the primary palace of the very long ruling Joseon dynasty. Kings were born, numerous royal weddings took place, and royalty died in this palace complex. Kings wrote poetry in the secret garden, one famous poem is etched in stone here.

It is true some parts of the palace have been rebuilt after Korea's tumultous history during the 20th century, but there are numerous structures that are very well preserved. Geumcheongyo Bridge is the oldest bridge in Seoul and dates back to 1411. The oldest wooden buildings are from the 17th century, as the palace was burned to the ground in the Imjin War. Injeongjeon Hall, the most grand building of the palace was last rebuilt in 1804.

The secret garden is the most celebrated of all Korean gardens, in which harmony with nature is of primary importance. Much of the trees in the garden are over 300 years old, some planted by royalty. It should also be noted that IUCN designated the secret garden as a conservation area because of its diverse ecosystem and landscape, despite being in central Seoul.

I have taken 5 tours of Changdeokgung palace, all of them different. It is one of the most important historical sites related with the Joseon dynasty. If history is not your thing, at the very least you can enjoy the beautful garden and imagine a different age."
"Close to Gyeongbok palace complex, this palce complex was also the victim of a number of fires. What has been reconstructed is gorgeous, tho. A pamphlet accompanies admission, and, once again, it pays to review it. There is a separate admission fee to tour the ""Secret Garden."" No one is allowed into this area without a guide (free with price of admission). Once inside, you can wander around on your own, or stay with the group. The garden requires a lot of walking. Again, comfortable shoes are a must. There are lovely buildings, examples of a wealthy noble's house, a tea house, a library, as well as 300 yr. old specimen trees. When the weather is hot, this garden affords a chance to sit and cool off while looking at lovely architecture in nature."
"This is a must see in Seoul. It is a beautiful palace, well maintained. On the day we visited there were volunteers weeding the courtyard to maintain its pristine condition. A sense of history pervades the area and you can almost see the king holding sway in his official rooms. The contrast between the king's house and the rest of the palace is amazing.
The secret garden attached to the palace is another must see. The tranquility is wonderful and the garden is inspiring."
"The Palace is great, i like the decorations and the buildings, and the most amazing part, is changing the guards, it's so nice.
No way to go Seoul without visiting it."
"2nd palace to Gyeongbok Palace. The entire compound is huge, bigger than the first palace. Nice for evening strolls. Airy feel to the entire palace compound."
"Rated as one of the UNESCO world heritage sites, my friend had highly recommended me to visit Changdeokgung!

The palace was beautiful and if I remembered correctly, it's not as huge as Gyeongbokgung and was easier on the legs and more comfortable to visit during winter (snow) time. I love the huwon secret garden which you have to pay a fee for it. There are free tour guides at allocated times, so do some homework before going."
"Well kept heritage! The Secret Garden is a must visit!
The nature surrounding this palace is definitely amazing!"
"Although the Gyeonbokgung Palace is nicer to see, do not skip on this palace, because the changing of the guard spectacle here is amazing. Definitely something to see. The palace grounds are huge and the builidings impressive. However they lack the funrnishing and fixtures as seen in other places."
If you want to find out about the history of Korea this is an must. It is located within walking distance of the city hall district. We were lucky enough to meet a wonderful volunteer guide who took us around and explained the significance of the various sections. As with all the buildings we visited it is well laid out and spotlessly maintained.
"We arrived for the formal changing of the guard ceremony; fabulous drumming and costumes. The palace complex is very peaceful and beautiful, especially the formal state dining building surrounded by a pond, mountains in the distance. The painting of the ceilings and walls is stunning and amazingly colorful. The English guidebooks are most helpful. It's hard to believe you are in the middle of Seoul while visiting here."
"We went to this palace the day after we went to Gyeongbokgung Palace and we could really see how the tour guide makes a huge difference in the enjoyment of a palace. This palace was similar to Gyeongbokgung but it had an extensive ""secret garden.""

The tour guide we had knew her stuff and could speak decent English, but was impatient to finish the tour and so she kept hurrying us along and would start talking before everyone caught up. As a result, this wasn't as good for us as the visit to Gyeongbokgung."
"A beautiful palace that is unique in Asia for its orientation not to cardinal directions but in harmony with the local site. It is easy to see why it has been designated a World Heritage Site. The provided maps and well placed signs make exploring on your own easy, but the provided tours in different languages are well worth joining as the guides provide additional information. The optional ""Secret Garden"" tour is also exceptional, but can only be seen by joining in one of the provided tours. The palace is also conveniently located to see the Changgyonggung palace next door and the the Jongmyo shrine. We were able to see both palaces, the garden and the shrine in one day with a bit of planning on the tours. The combination ticket that you can purchase at any of the palaces providing access for all the Seoul palaces, the Secret Garden and the Jongmyo shrine is also a good value if you plan on seeing 4 or more of them and it gives a detailed list of when the tours occur at each of them."
"Like so many attractions in this part of Seoul you feel as is you have been transported back in time when you arrive at the palace. There is a bit of ground to cover so give yourself enough time to walk about the area. The only detraction is that the English speaking tours of the secret garden(its mandatory to take a guided tour) are only at certain times, so be smarter that and time your visits here accordingly."
i was taking city tour in seoul and the tour guide took us here to see the palace that the king and queen used to live. it is quite nice to see what kind of palace that the emperor used to live. the tour guide also explained to us about the history about the place. it is quite entertaining to see the historical place like this.
"This palace is within walking distance of our hotel in the Insadong neighborhood. It well deserves the UNESCO World Heritage designation. We took the English Speakers tour and had a wonderful time exploring the hidden garden, though not really hidden. The place is huge and takes some time to see, so bring water and enjoy a very unique experience. And don't skip the hidden garden tour. It costs a few won but well worth it."
"after Gyeongbukgung that is, and by this time I was staying just across the road :-) As it smaller and more intimate I sort of found it more interesting, particularly with quite a good English guide for explanations. The Biwon/Forbidden Garden however seems really only an opportunity to charge you more money (you have to go on a tour) as it is not really all that stunningly different or spectacular - would not go there twice, let's put it that way."
This palace is built in harmony with its topography. The private rear garden which is known as secret garden is place not to be missed with beautiful pavilions and ponds
"The palace is well-preserved and rather grand.

Take the garden tour if you can, the garden's beautiful :) Be prepared to walk quite a bit though."
"This palace complex is gorgeous and set into a leafy hillside.
Take a tour of the secret garden behind the palace complex. The entrance to the complex is 2 minutes from the metro station. Definitely check this place out. It is beautiful and very romantic."
It's a UNESCO treasure. I love all the detailing in this palace and its ground. It feels like travel back in time.
nice ancient structure.situated in seoul and showing the ancient Korea and its art of making a huge complex for its emperror.
"Being May (late winter), the trees and flowers were not in bloom yet. I'm sure it would be worth going in other times of the year, especially the secret garden. No probs with our baby's pram.
We couldn't understand the ''english'' tour guide! It probably would have been more informative with the Korean guide with my limited Korean."
"I only visited this palace because I had extra time in Seoul and had half a day to spend on this palace, Insa-dong, and the Buchon villiage. Do not expect a grand palace as Gyeongbokgung. If you want to visit, come for the history not for the sight.

Unlike Gyeongbokgung which is connected to the subway station, the Changaokgung is a bit of a walk from the subway station. Just when I thought I missed it, there it was. This palace does not boast a large foot print and does not have as many grand structures as Gyeongbokgung. There is no guards nor ceramoney. There is not much to see really. The english tour is only about $3 and the guide tried her best and made the palace tour more interesting than it was.

There is a secret garden behind the palace, which occupies most of the land and requires a seperate entrance which I will described below. The tour costs $5 and the tour guide also did a great job. However, the garden is similar to our community garden back home, with a few traditional Korean structures scattered around. It is a hilly garden and not the best for the physically challenged.

If anyone is planning on a day tour to cover this palace, the secret garden, Insa-dong, and the village, one needs to be fit. If you are like me who only hikes 2-5 miles a day, I recommend skipping the secret garden (or the Changdaekgung all together) and use your time and energy for other things more exciting in Seoul, which are plentiful. You can read about the history of Changdaekgung without spending precious time here."
"For us - this was average palace in Seoul. It is same as other palaces in the city, but admission is 3 times higher (I know - it is UNESCO). That was reason for only 3 stars."
Worth a visit to get an idea of Korean history. The guide was excellent and the visit lasted about one hour.
"The rebuilding of the palace is well done. It does not feel like a rebuild, but feels authentic. Taking a tour is a good idea, because many of the buildings look alike. A tour helps you know what you are viewing...."
Liked - love the old buildings and the history behind them
"You can stretch your legs, walk around outside, and forget you are in a very big city. Take the guided tour. Nothing too exciting, but it is beautiful, and an oasis of peace in this large city. I fell in love with my gorgeous tour guide, LOL."
"This palace is far more beautiful than the nearby Gyoungbok Palace, as it is harmoniously built into the mountainside (by design), and offers beautiful gardens (Secret Gardens) as well. Beautifully restored and well worth visiting. You can enter some of the buildings.

Recommended: Take a free, guided tour, either from the Palace (times posted upon entry) or by reserving one at the Korean Tourist Agency (http://www.visitseoul.net/)."
"You can get into this palace through a gate in the palace next door. The buildings are not as interesting as in the neigbour palace, and the decorations are fewer. The best thing about is the huge garden with big trees and a charming pond."
"The palace is just beautiful against the different backdrop of each season. Bask in the different look and color the palace when it transforms itself during each season. It is also worth purchasing the extra ticket to the Secret Garden. You can only enter the garden with a guided tour. Learn about the ""secrets"" of the palace and the life of the imperial kings of the Joseon Dynasty."
"Not an impressive place, but the mandatory conducted tour of the gardens is informative."
Nice palace. The Secret Garden tour is worth the extra 90 minutes if you have time.
The courtyards seem to go on forever and there were many interesting architectural wonders to see. Always wonderful to learn a little more about the different aspects of Korean architecture. I would definitely recommend getting a guide here
"Good to read up first and focus on the chambers that you intend to visit.
A guided tour would be good to explain in details.
Wonderful experience to witness the change-of-guard possession.
Take it easy, savour the rich culture, close your eyes and envision the time the Officers were standing according to their ranks.
I did not walk around too much but the ancient buildings, vastness, how sommers were being kept cool (by lifting doors in hanging horizontal positions) were a marvel."
"Overall Changdeokgung Palace is a nice place. However I personally dislike the secret garden tour. It is a 1& half hour walking tour and the walking is really killing. Most of the time, we are walking uphill at a 80 degree angle which is very taxing on the knees.
After the secret garden tour, we are too exhausted to go for our shopping."
We took an English speaking tour here and were VERY impressed. The palace grounds seem to go on for ever! One beautiful building after another. Our guide was informative and gave us little interesting facts about the colours used on the buildings and the number of small statues on the roofs. Definitely a must-see!
"If you're palace hopping in Seoul, this one is highly recommended -- there are quite a few buildings to check out, regular English tours of the buildings and the Secret Garden, and plenty of spots for interesting pictures. You can check out the buildings unguided, and that would take up less than an hour (depending on how short your attention span is). I didn't get a guide and that's probably why I left thinking it was a pretty place but without much insight on the history (brochure was pretty thin and mostly served as a map).

Re Secret Garden, when choosing an exit option, the ""never before trodden"" one is okay -- they say it's hilly and long but it didn't feel like it was more difficult to walk that way than the ""retracing your steps to the entrance of the garden"" route. Budget 1.5 hours for the Secret Garden if you're guided (in certain seasons, you can wander about unguided). English tourists on the 11:30 run -- bring a sandwich and a drink! It's a huge garden, and you can't get lunch inside.

While there, see the Bukchon houses and Insadong -- these top tourist spots are all near the Anguk Station."
this is one of the palaces that are unique in the Korean history with its amazing and different architectural outline. the english interpretation was great and it provides an intrusion into the Korean culture beyond what we know already.
"There were very few signs translated into English so a little hard to understand the history. It was all very clean but just a little sterile? It was compulsory to take a guided tour to get to see the ""Secret Garden"" but unfortunately, they were all full so I missed out on that"
"we had an english speaking guide, although she was rather hard to understand, was a very different type of palace, not the usual gold around the place, alot of ornate paint work and all wooden, very interesting"
"Apart from the size, I'm not impress with this palace much. The style are similar to other palace in Seoul. It's also very crowded, so full of people rushing to follow tour guides."
"Very lovely, colorful urban setting. Lots of schoolkids on field trips, some in period costume to learn about their heritage. Very clean, well-maintained palace in the middle of this huge, modern city. Visited with HanaTour during an 8 hour layover."
"The highlight of my visit was the Secret Garden, it is really beautiful and green. Enjoy the walk and take time to sit to admire the view from the pavilions."
"The palace itself is average. You cannot go inside any of the buildings, but the grounds are well kept and the exteriors are well renovated. The guided tours are awful, so don't waste your time. The guides rush from location to location and begin speaking as soon as they reach the next spot, but before the majority of the travelers have caught up. Even with a microphone, we could not hear what one of our guide was saying she spoke so softly. The groups, especially for the Huwon, are massive, so that also makes it challenging to keep up and hear your tour. Also, the guides dictate, verbatim, what is in the pamphlet they hand you when you buy your tickets, so you could easily have a much more enjoyable self-guided tour on your own schedule. While we were able to tour the Huwon on our own, I do believe for the most part, you are required to be with a guide. The Huwon was beautiful and we thoroughly enjoyed our time there photographing it. Do not expect your typical floral garden- there are very few flowers in the Huwon, which our friends were disappointed to discover. The garden features nicely maintained buildings, some small ponds and lots of greenery on well shaded pathways. The Huwon is a great stop in Korea."
The others were much more pleasing to the eye. Still important part of Korean history.
It is really fascinating to step into such a polished home that used to house a king.
"Paid 8000won for a palace+secret garden tour. There are tours conducted in various languages, we attended the English one.

It was alright, to me all the palaces looked the same! Both the exterior and interior..

If you enjoy a walk in nature, then you should probably visit the secret garden... lots of trees and plants."
"This palace certainly has a lot to explore. But you do not need to know the history because the buildings are magnificent without knowing the history.

There are a number of buildings to work around and a plethora of things to learn - if you are interested take a guide from the front and work slowly round each building.

The gardens look wonderful but we spent so much time wandering through the buildings that we ran out of time to investigate the 'Secret Gardens'."
"The size of the palace is impressive, and if you take into account that the secret gardens are also part of it, you will definitely have things to see for a couple of hours. We did not visit the secret garden, because the reviews said that it's not the typical garden full of flowers. And we thought that we pretty much saw the korean style garden around the palace itself.
However we also visited the Changgyeong palace, which you can get to from inside this palace (entrance next to the meeting point for the secret garden). From there we headed to the Jongmyo shrine, which was about a 15 minute walk.
Besides its size, I personally didn't find anything outstanding about this palace. I have seen other asian palaces which were much more adorned - I honestly expected more design (inside and outside) that what it actually had. However the buildings are well maintained and the surrounding area / park is clean. The place is very dusty, so by the end of your visit you will most likely have to clean your shoes."
We did a tour around the palace which was interesting. Although we were disappointed in the lack of colour of the place. Especially after visiting castles in Europe
"There are about 5 palaces around Seoul. Read up on them, pick carefully, and go to some, BUT NOT ALL as much is replicated. For a deeper insight into them, take a guided tour at one, but no more."
its easily go to by subway.. palace is big and clean...
Beautiful- how I wished though that visitors of the palace can automatically gain entrance to the secret garden. Tickets to the garden are limited to 100 per day. Too bad that the garden's selling site over the web is in korean only.
"Worth a visit and to the secret garden, probably best with a tour guide. Watch it, on this trip the English tour guide went at 2.30pm"
"Good any time of the year, the autumn leaves are spectacular. Guided tours only in the most secluded gardens, scheduled by foreign language tours. Need to check schedule ahead of time."
"We hit this and the Jongmyo shrine right next door and the grounds were beautiful, even on a rainy day. The park was extremely clean and open. There's only one day a week (Tuesday I think) where you can enter and tour on your own. Otherwise you get stuck with a tour guide and even the English tour guides don't really speak English well. Still worth the trip, especially since it's less than $5 to get in and you can always break away from the pack a little and see the sites at your own pace."
"This is my favorite part of Seoul. Not as busy as the Gyeong Bok Palace, and more beautiful than any other palaces. Must tour the garden. If you don't have time to walk for 90 min in the garden, just skip this place."
Building were nice. The secret garden was closed during our visit. Nice if you have time to walk around and enjoy the peacefulness.
I have always love to see old architecture building with historical value.
A very large site with numerous buildings and gardens. Maps and tourist info provided allow for easy navigation and understanding of the palace buildings and grounds. Well worth the time and a nice break from the hustle and bustle of the city surrounding the area. Spend about 2.5 hours - not enough time to see the gardens and plan to return someday.
"We very much enjoyed our visit to Changdeokgung Palace but more so our guided Secret Garden tour. We used the handbook that was given to us at the ticket office to self guide our way around the Palace, we probably only spent one hour wandering around before our secret garden tour. On the day of our visit there would have been around 50 people in our tour, the guide managed the number very well, waiting in most instances for everyone to catch up when walking from one site to another.

The tour lasts 1 hour and 40 minute, apparently Autumn is the best time of year to visit per the guide, but we very much enjoyed what nature had on offer, the cherry blossoms were out, and that's a nice thing. The secret garden was built for the sole use of the royal family in Joseon Dynasty, even today it is a peaceful place in a busy city. The water features are not as stunning as they would have been in the 1400s when they were designed, due to the growth of the city, so one can only imagine what is was like back then. There is a lot of walking on the tour, some steep hills and stairs to navigate, it is surprising how unfit most people were in our tour, young and old, and they would lag behind, but the tour seems to accommodate this.

As we were staying in downtown Seoul we were able to walk from our hotel to the Palace. I had reserved our places for the tour online the night before, but never needed to show my reservation number at the ticket office as they were plenty of tickets available on the day."
Its no comparison to the typical palaces of Europe or other parts of Asia.
Beautiful palace with expansive grounds. Unmissable and make sure you catch the 'changing of the guards'
The palace is huge! It's a nice experience to see how the royals used to live back then. They provide English-spoken guided tour to the beautiful (used to be hidden) garden.
Small palace compared to Gyeongbokgung. But the secret garden was huge. Lots of walking (hiking) inside the garden. We went at a wrong timing and season and the garden landscape was boring without any colours.
"Beautiful grounds. The Secret Garden add on is a worthwhile visit. The gardens are Korean style - mainly trees and shrubs. So if you're expecting a beautiful English garden with lots of flowers, you may be disappointed.

There is a great FREE eponymous iPhone app for the palace. It serves as an audio guide and GPS map. Because of its size, it would be best to download it before going."
Very well preserved and maintained example of Korean palatial architecture. check out the secret garden that's only accessible as a part of a guided tour... You should be at the ticket office at least fifteen minutes prior to departure otherwise they won't let you join in...
"The secrest garden is the most beatuiful place to visit. The best time to visit is Fall, end of October and in the beginning of November"
It was fall and the view was breathtaking. Surely will come here again during fall season. This in one place you not gonna to write off from your itinerary.
"We visited this palace and enjoyed it. However, don't expect to see much, as it's a replica (most burned either during the 1910 occupation, WWII or the Korean war) and there is literally no furniture par a bed and a throne to see. The gardens are probably the biggest asset. We didn't visit those as you need to follow a guided tour and that didn't fit our schedule."
"This palace has been designated a World Heritage site by Unesco. The grounds are extensive, especially if you combine the visit with the other palace to the East so have some good walking shoes. Beautiful and well preserved. It is also very close to the Bukcheon village (old Hanoks, the Korean traditional homes) Lovely secret garden in the back."
We only had time for one palace and we chose this one. It was a good place to walk around for a couple of hours. My kids enjoyed it and it wasn't too big. That kept them from getting bored.
"Very nice historical palace grounds, very similar to Gyeongbokgung Palace but not as grand in size and extravigance, The wooded grounds are beautiful and definetly worth a one time look for historical value and significance, an hour or so is pleanty of time for this one.

Note*** If you are short on time the two attarctions are similar enough that I would go with Gyeongbokgung, as it is by far the better attraction."
"A visit here will make for a pleasant hour or two of your day. There's not much to see except for lovely old buildings and gardens, so it's not mentally exhausting like a museum -- more like a walk in a World Heritage park.

Tours of the Palace and Secret Garden are offered in English at 11:30 and 14:30 (closed Mondays). There are tours offered in other languages at different times, but I'm sorry I can't remember them all. You must be on a tour to enter the Secret Garden, but you don't need it for the Palace. If you choose not to take a tour of the Palace grounds, make sure you grab one of the little green information booklets (free) from the entrance gate, as there isn't much signage to tell you what you're looking at."
"Compared to Gyeongbokgung, this is smaller in size but also has the same impressive architecture. It has more greenery and I bet it's more beautiful during spring. Best to see the Secret Garden after visiting this palace."
"Located at Bukchon, get off at Anguk Stn (line 3) exit 3 and walk about 5 min to Changdeokgung Palace. The Bukchon Village also surrounded by the wall of this palace at some part. Here, they offer 2 courses, which is Changdeokgung and Huwon Course. Interpretation services also available for english, chinese and japanese. Closed on monday."
"Nice park, all the buildings where closed for renovation."
"A little different from the Gyeongbokgung Palace, both of the palaces are hugh, however, Changdeokgung Palace has more nature within the property. It totally feels like being somewhere else, away from the city, when it's located right inside the city. Very well maintained and it's beautiful!"
Don't miss this palace that is so close to central Seoul. It is definitely a must-see place!
Changdeokgung Palace is one of the must-see attractions in Seoul. The palace is a beautiful example of Korean architecture and gives a good impression of the historical power of Asian civilizations. I recommend to combine the visit to the palace with the paid tour to Sacred Garden.
A great place for Korean history and photo opportunities.
It was the best historical tour I've had in Korea. I was approached by a middle school English student who volunteers with her dad to give tours. She was extraordinary and the site was excellent!
"I think it's the largest, and the most well-preserved palace in Seoul with a beautiful secret garden. Unfortunately, you cannot freely walk around at this place except for every Thursday(?not sure). You have to follow a guide at the scheduled time. But I recommend you to take a guidance because you can hear very interesting stories about kings' family and the Chosun dynasty."
"I loved every bit of this place, given that I love all these historical stuff..! Changdeokgung was really well-preserved. But reserve more time for it - I did a quick run-through.. :(

Try to take the subway there, better than the crazy traffic, and also, try to take the subway back, though it may be a little difficult to locate."
"It's not open to public all the time, but it's worth going if you can."
"We walked through the Biwon (secret garden) in the frigid Seoul weather of Christmas Day.
Actually we were at the Changdeokgung Palace the day before but we were told we just missed the last English tour of the day. So on the 24th we only got to see the palace itself. If you are a foreigner it is assumed that you need an English tour. In the cold short winter days of December (may be even January and February), there were only two English tours in a day. It was at 11:30am and 2:30 pm. (It is worth double checking these times for yourself) We were not the only ones who were disappointed and had to go back a second time. (We were also made to pay the palace tour again)
The palace itself was ok. In spite of the cold and the run around, the Biwon was worth it.
In the palace compound proper one can still see the city buildings around. Once inside the garden it was a hidden world, and a very photogenic place. The idea is closer to a rambling Chinese garden with hills, ponds, gates, teahouses and pavilions than a controlled Japanese Zen meditation garden. Enjoy!
The gift shop/Cafe carries good souvenirs but somewhat pricey.
On the way out, west of the palace compound there are a few restaurants. For very delicious and very sizeable meat dumplings and oyster/fish pancakes, Buckchon Restaurant is highly recommended. (This place has tables and chairs) The service was also very good."
"If you are debating which palace to go to (because there are just so many in Seoul), this one is the best to see in Spring because of its beautiful gardens. Make sure you go earlier in the day if you go because sometimes the garden tours close pretty early. I would say however that the garden tour isn't much to see in summer (there aren't any real colors...just lots of trees). I have gone to the palaces every season except winter and spring is best for the garden but fall could come in a very close seconds. It's all personal preference. This palace also ""connects"" to another palace area so you could wipe out two birds with one stone by going to see this one instead."
You can only visit with a tour; you can't walk around by yourself. The tour explanation was very good. Unfortunately only about 30% of the palace is still standing as the rest was destroyed during the Japanese occupation. Hopefully the Korean government will get around to reconstructing the rest of the building once they have finished with other reconstruction projects of other palaces.
"Though the buildings have been reconstructed, it was pleasant to wander around a park setting with historical Korean architecture."
"Went there during winter. Was freezing cold. Biwon (secret garden) is a must, but the lake was frozen and the trees were bare. It has it's own desolate beauty, but i think it would be prettier during autumn/ spring"
After walking through Insadong the other side of Insadong is Angguk turn right will lead you to this Palace. There is an entrance fee of 7000won in the palace add 4000won and you can enter the secret garden located near the palace.
Bring a camera. I belive this is the palace with the Secret Garden. Take the tour!
"We visited early in the morning, not knowing the tour schedules. I remember enjoying the early morning walk with the chilly autumn air and the misty almost empty streets until we came to the gate of the palace, which I thought was*the* palace at first since it was so large.

We spent about an hour touring the place by ourselves and mingled with the other tourists reading the brochures and the markers until it was finally time for the English guided tour at 10.30 a.m.

There were actually many tourists around, most of them I think were Japanese or Korean, but the place was so large that the compound never felt full, it seemed rather empty even!

We were glad we joined the guided tour. There are much more fascinating facts to be learned about the buildings and the comings and goings of the Joseon dynasty members that we didn't find out just by reading the brochure or palace markers.

We didn't get to visit all the palaces in Seoul, but we were definitely glad we visited this one. Truly a beautiful and historical site.

If you are going there, wear comfortable shoes and prepare to walk a lot. The compound is big and will take about two hours worth of walking to explore sufficiently (not fully, I think you'd need a day or two for that). And don't miss the tour of the Secret Garden near the back area of the palace! This requires a separate entrance fee and has a different tour schedule."
"A lot of people visited Chandeokgung Palace but missed the Secret Palace, either because they do not know about the Secret Garden or they did not want to pay the additional KRW5,000 (which is approx USD5).

I highly recommend the Secret Garden tour as this is where the kings/royal family used to date, write poetries etc. In the olden days, the royal family is not allowed to step outside the palace.

If you buy the palace combination ticket (KRW10,000 - admission to 5 places including Jongmyo shrine), the guided tour is included. Admission into Secret Garden is only by guided tour so take note of the tour time. English is at 230pm."
"The palace was spacious and the guide from the attraction itself gave us a really good walkthrough of the place, with great explanation in Chinese. He was very clear and answered all our questions.

The problem was that most of the rooms are closed. Only 2 were open for viewing, the throne room and the bedroom. Even so, the bedroom looked very fake. About 50% of the place looks less authentic thanks to the refurbishing I guess and the colours and features look too fresh and brand new. So I guess it really spoils the atmosphere of the place.

There's also a section which closed at 3pm so if you want to go to all sections remember to go before 3pm. There's a coffee place and souvenir shop inside if you get hungry and they have about 3 restroom areas around the attraction.

Definitely worth a visit... just don't get your hopes up."
"The location of the palace is very easy to get to: you can either take the Seoul City tour bus and stop here, or you can take the metro and alight at the station (there are signs in the subway that will direct you to which exit is closest).

There's always a line outside so be mindful of the crowds. There's an entrance fee, and you can purchase a ticket from a booth located outside the main gates. You can also opt for an English tour, which only goes for certain times in the day (we chose the 11 am slot). The tour doesn't start on time because the guide wants to get as much of the English-speaking people together as possible (there was only one person doing the tour for about 20 people). This particular tour goes on for around two hours and only covers the palace grounds; you'll have to purchase another ticket for the Secret Garden tour, which only goes in the afternoon (in my case it had been around 2 pm).

Because we were so many, it was hard to hear the guide speak. She was dressed in a bright and colorful Hanbok (I think so it's easier for us to spot her) and brought around a small microphone but we still strained to hear what she was talking about. She also had a folder with pictures of things so we had a visual of stuff she talked about. You can ask her questions if you misheard something or would like to learn more, but I recommend you do this aside so it doesn't prolong everyone. It's very scripted and impersonal. In every station she allots a few minutes so you can take pictures or explore the area on your own before moving on. As I mentioned earlier, this was just a tour of the main palace, so she took us to the sleeping quarters, the library, the ritual house, the kitchens, the receiving area, the bridge, etc. On the day that we went it wasn't crowded so we were able to take photos without random people in it.

The tour of the Secret Garden was the highlight of this experience. You buy a separate ticket and can opt for the English tour as well, but others just choose to walk the course by themselves (which eventually you will do because the place will absorb you). The grounds are MASSIVE. The emperor had it right having a whole freaking park as his backyard. He and the crown prince had their own libraries, and plenty of pavilions that allowed you a view of, say, the lake from different angles. The buildings are pretty far from each other (you will mostly just walk) because they go with the natural flow of the mountain. Our tour guide (dressed in the same bright Hanbok and armed with the same tiny mic) was a little scary because she looked like she was having a bad day. She wasn't very open to questions and those she did answer she returned with monosyllables and a glare. Her pace is just right, allowing maybe 7 minutes per station (including photo-taking), and she keeps reminding you that you can go off by yourself and never get lost as long as you follow the paved path. I should mention that before you start the tour, you should head to the bathroom because there are no others in the area save for the one at the souvenir shop near the entrance. You should also bring an umbrella along during their rainy season, because chances are it WILL rain and there is nowhere you can seek shelter. Also bring a water bottle because it is a long walk and you may get thirsty along the way.

They have justifiably named this a world heritage site, and you cannot pass this up when you come to Seoul."
"For mere pennies, a visitor is able to get a taste of past royal life and its opulence in South Korea."
"I spent a couple of hours visiting this palace, taking one of the few English-language tours available. It was very crowded on the day, as the other main palace was closed so all tourists flocked here. Even so, it was an interesting visit and an opportunity to learn a few things about Korean history and culture.
Sadly I did not make it to the secret garden, as I ran out of time, but this attraction is well worth a visit!
A word of warning for people with physical impairments. There are some extremely steep steps to climb so don't be disappointed if you won't be able to see every part of it. Still, there should be plenty to make it worth your while."
"I like the place specially we went there during autumn. It is just very tiring to walk/hike to the hills. I should have wear comfortable shoes, not boots."
Interesting place to visit if you are interested in history of korea palaces!
Had taken the Secret Garden two hours english tour and was wonderful to know and understand Korean culture and its history. Must visit for anyone who is interested in knowing these things. The palace was also ncie.
"I had previously reserved an 11.30 am Secret Garden tour in English but underestimated the travelling time from my hotel to the Palace grounds. Thankfully, the reservation did not include the entrance fees which had to be paid on admission. So I managed to book a 2.30 pm slot for W8000 (palace entrance plus tour). Once the ticket is booked, you can enter at any time but for the Secret Garden tour, you need to assemble at its own entrance located 600-700 m into the palace grounds before the tour starts.

The palace grounds were large and extensive and built largely to the precepts of Buddhist philosophy. Compared to other Asian palaces, while it wasn't unattractive, I found this one to be fairly sparse and less lavish. I didn't hire a guide but generally didn't need one as simple explanations were placed strategically at each important location. The main highlight, as many reviewers have mentioned, is the Secret Garden tour. The gardens were a complete contrast to the main palace grounds - lush, tree-filled, and a world away from the noise noise and heat outside. Our guide, dressed in traditional Hanbok outfit, led the group through the various attractions and gave us a reasonable explanation of what we were looking at and how the royals lived in previous centuries. One thing that cannot be underestimated is the length of the tour - 1.5-2 hours. Although there were numerous rests, it can still be tiring because many areas are very hilly. Some paths were also not paved, and the sandy ground underfoot could be somewhat slippery, so wear good walking shoes. Apparently, the Secret Garden can be done without joining a tour in late-October when large crowds visit to see the fall colours,"
"This palace, now in Seoul, was originally built in the early 1400's and restored in the early 1600's. Beautiful architecture and grounds. I went there with Korean friends and we spent a few delightful hours exploring this historical site."
"Seoul was made the capital city of Korea over six centuries back by the Joseon Dynasty (1392-1910). It was the last Dynasty to rule Korea before that country was taken over by Japan. Korea became independent again only after Japan's defeat in World War II - only to be divided between the democratic South and the Communist North. Today, The South is a showpiece liberal democracy, while the North has the most repressive regime anywhere.

The Gyeongbokgung Palace (gung means palace) is the oldest and largest palace to be built by that dynasty, with the huge main building having an imposing Korean-style double roof. Visitors can have themselves pictured with the ""Royal Guards"", dressed in colourful peroid costumes, and carrying weapons of their times. On my last day in Seoul, I was fortunate to witness a detailed religious ceremony featuring numerous priests, singers and dancers, all in colourful period costumes. It was living history at its best. (Admission Won 3,000, Tuesdays closed). On the palace grounds are the excellent National Palace Museum of Korea and the National Folk Museum of Korea (entry free, closed on Mondays and Tuesdays, respectively).

The Changdeokgung Palace, set up later, became the favourite residence of later Joseon Dynasty Kings, and is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. It has numerous wooden buildings, esthetically painted, and displaying an understated elegance. Korean palaces are very different from the ostentatious palaces of Western Europe. The attached Huwon Garden is a beautiful example of Joseon-period garden architecture. The King and his people would stroll around the lotus pond and even discuss matters of state there. (Admission Won 3,000, closed on Mondays. Tour of garden Won 5,000 more)..

Right next to it is the smaller Changgyeonggung Palace, built as the residence of three dowager Queens. It is also worth a visit. The Deoksugung and Gyeonghuigung Palaces are much smaller still, and less important.

Tourists should preferably visit only the first two palaces mentioned above, and the Jongmyo Shrine - the Royal ancestrial shrine of the Joseon Dynasty, located nearby..

Seoul is so rich in historical and cultural attractions, world-class museums and art galleries, and classical music and dance performances, that my ten-day itinerary was inadequate to cover even half of it. It is a dream destination."
"I have been to Changdeokgung and the Secret Garden twice now. The best times to go would be in the springtime when all the flowers are in full bloom and the garden is alive with bird song. Autumn is also amazing as the fall foliage looks splendid as it complements the palace buildings. It is one of the five grand palaces within Seoul and is conveniently located nearby other popular tourist attractions. There is a separate entrance fee for Changdeokgung palace and the Secret Garden which boasts pavilions, lily ponds, a stream as well as luscious vegetation. You may only enter the Secret Garden as part of an organised tour. The tours are in Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese. For more detailed information and for many photographs please have a look at my blog post:

"In contrast with the more formal Gyeongbokgung, Changdeokgung looks like a pleasant place to live, especially with its extensive attached secret garden.
The casual visitor may only see a collection of buildings, but each closer look reveals new touches, as if peeling an onion... Walking through the grounds, one will at times catch a particularly harmonious fleeting glimpse, be it an alignment of roofs, a mountain through a small gate, a wall accommodating a tree, etc. The large number of healthy-looking birds further confirms that this is one of the nicest green spots in Seoul :)
Attached is a picture of the schedule of the various guided tours in their respective languages. My English-speaking guide spoke unaccented colloquial US English.
Be warned that the secret garden tour is arduous for elderly people, as the footpath includes some uneven stone stairs, and the tour is almost 2 hours in length, with few opportunities to sit."
"The Palace itself is nice, though similar to others. The entrance fee is cheap. If you want to visit the secret garden you should know that it is a guided tour that will take 1-2 hours, but I am not sure when the tours start. I do know there is one at 2:30pm. But other than that I am not sure, perhaps they are every half hour or hour, I don't know, we did not have enough time as we were headed back to our hotel to catch the bus to the airport, so we didn't get to visit.

There is also another palace you need to pay for inside, also not expensive, it needs about an hour, I think we went inside there, walked to the other entrance and then walked to get something to eat. It is a nice walk through the area

The rest of the palace is interesting, if you have some extra time and not sure where to go, I think it is worth seeing."
"I have been to several palaces around the world. Just to name some....China, Japan etc. Changdeokgung offers little. But I had nothing to do in the morning when most of the shops are not opened at 9am. The entrance fee is just a few bucks so when u visit this palace with high expectations, u lose nothing but just time. Just go in and have a feel of the korean palaces. At least when u visit one, u feel the connection when you watch korean dramas."
"Not much different than the first palace except for its 'Secret Garden'. I am sure that this garden is lovely but between the frozen ponds, barren trees and lack of all color except for brown and white, it was somewhat hard to imagine.
Hope to see yourself.."
"The tour is long, and more arduous than you might expect, as it climbs from the public front buildings right over to the private gardens at the back. The tour groups can be big, but so long as you keep up with your guide, you'll get heaps of fascinating information.Don't lag behind, tho! I've done the tour 3 times now with different friends and the guides have been excellent on each occasion. Different information- just different slants on the same info, of course- mean you can do it more than oce and still get plenty out of it.
You start with the official buidlings, look at where business was done, then where people lived. You see the last Emperor's cars, hear about the last (Japanese) empress and her last place to live. Then climb over the hill (mountain?) to the garden, with ponds, and beauty.
Then finally a stiff climb over the ridge before dropping back to the entrance.
Guides are knowledgable and -to my English ear- speak excellent English."
"I took a guided tour to the Changdeok Palace. The palace was the site of the last Korean royal court. It is well preserved in a beautiful ground. I find the rear garden with the pavilion and lotus pond especially enjoyable. The guided tours, required in most days and offered in various languages, are well worth it. It covers nearly the entire ground in 1.5 to 2 hours. Our guide is very friendly and knowledgeable. I like her telling the stories and how the royal court functions."
"As someone who taught English in Korea for almost 20 years (we left Korea in 1983), I was very disappointed in the English guided tour. The guide's content was not suited to foreigners' knowledge or experience, and the pronunciation and word-usage was abominable. Towards the end of the tour very few of the tourists were even trying to listen to the guide. I must say, however, that I was impressed with the tremendous improvement in the English language of signs in this palace as well as other historical sites we visited in Korea."
The tour of the palace grounds was great. The guides were very knowledgeable on the history of the palace. Highly recommended
"This is a large palace situated on hilly terrain on the northern side of Seoul's downtown area. As a previous reviewer mentioned, you can only go in as part of a tour group and it's easy enough to join. Just buy your ticket and wait for the next group tour in your language (Korean, Chinese, Japanese, English). Changdeokgun is also known as Biwon which is the name given to the Secret Garden behind the palace buildings. The garden is really stunning with ponds, and a library (off limits) situated in the garden. At one point, climbing a steep hill, I felt like I was trekking through a forest. There is also a 750-year old Chinese Juniper tree on the grounds, not to mention other trees that are hundreds of years old. The palace has a sad history -- during Japanese rule, it was turned into a zoo. It is beautifully restored now. Of interest are the unpainted servants quarters."
"They only allow guided tours here, so if you go on your own, you should be aware that the English tours are at 11:30 AM, 1:30 PM and 3:30 PM. Walking distance is about one mile and there is a substantial hill about mid way in the tour."
magnificent palace to do under the sun and absolutely take a visit to the very beautiful secret garden! Pay attention to closing days and reservations for the garden!
"On our last family trip to South Korea, in addition to visiting two theme parks and two major business districts, we also had a short royal palace tour. One of the mornings, we immediately went to a hanbok shop and let everyone change into beautiful hanbok before going to visit the palace. Wearing period costumes and taking photos in the palace will take everyone back to ancient Korea. After changing into Hanbok, everyone went to ""Donhwamun"", one of the entrances to ""Changdeokgung Palace"", and started our Hanbok-Hangung tour.

Our tour group included tickets. The main palace charges 3,000 WON, while the back garden charges 5,000 WON. When I returned to Hong Kong, my friend said that if I didn’t go into the backyard, I would have breast cancer. We all know this, and we also know that the main purpose of visiting ""Changdeokgung Palace"" this time is not to tour the palace, but to give us a Hanbok experience so that we can take photos and check in in an antique place. Therefore, this market situation is really a matter of speculation.

Now that the event has arrived, of course we need to understand the origin of ""Changdeokgung Palace"". At the ticket sales and check-in area at the door, there are leaflets in different languages. I can't help but take one and go home to slowly study the history of this place.

Changdeokgung Palace is the second palace built after Gyeongbokgung Palace. This once became the main palace of ancient Korea. Therefore, in terms of scale, it can match ""Gyeongbokgung Palace"". That day, when we entered the ""Jinshan Gate"", it was the entrance to the main palace, the ""Renzheng Gate"". In ancient Korea, and perhaps ancient China, this ""three-door"" model was common in palaces and temples.

After passing through the ""Renzheng Gate"", we came to the ""Renzheng Hall"". This place is also where we took photos wildly. It turns out that in ""Changdeokgung Palace"", all civil and military personnel of the dynasty had to meet the king in the square outside the palace. There are cards on the ground of the square, starting from the first-rank official of the nearest palace to the last ninth-rank official. The positions and powers are clearly defined.

In ancient times, it was difficult to walk to the gate of the palace. Today, as a tourist, it is definitely not difficult to approach the palace gate. However, it is still difficult to enter the palace. The reason is to protect cultural relics, and we can only look in in front of the palace.

We left the ""Injeong Hall"" through another gate and came to a place called ""Yizheng Gate"". The place behind the gate is the ""Xuanzheng Hall"", where the king discussed with ministers and handled daily court affairs.

Before leaving the palace, of course, I went to shop. The store sells many Korean handicrafts. Some are even traditional jewelry made from antiques. This time, my wife has gained something, but I have forgotten what she bought."
"This palace is very beautiful. You cannot imagine how wonderful I am with it. It is very beautiful, wonderful, and a lot of fun in Korea. Very beautiful, wonderful, and very enjoyable"
"A UNESCO World Heritage Site, Changdeokgung was built in 1404 to house the royal family and remained a royal residence until 1989. The palace, adjacent to Mount Bugak, perfectly illustrates the desire to integrate palaces and gardens into their natural surroundings and topography, rather than the other way around."
Very beautiful palace. The site is smaller than Gyeongbokgung and less equipped with buildings it seems to me. Just the main palace is worth it especially if you have already seen Gyeongbokgung.
"It was built as a secondary palace to the east of Gyeongbokgung Palace in 1405. It was burnt down during the Japanese invasions of Korea, rebuilt during the reign of Gwanghaegun, and served as a royal palace until the reconstruction of Gyeongbokgung Palace in 1867. In this way, it was a place with the history of the dynasty until the end of the Joseon Dynasty. It was registered as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1997 for its outstanding architectural beauty, harmonious arrangement with nature, and Korean feel. It is attached to Changgyeonggung Palace and can be moved around inside. It is a place that offers more things to see than Changgyeonggung Palace as it has buildings of the same level as Gyeongbokgung Palace, but the back garden (secret garden) is a place where part-time viewing is limited by advance reservation."
"Very pretty palace with beautiful aisles. Pretty colors and very pretty living rooms, throne,...."
"Resa or not resa for the “secret garden”?
Difficult to get a slot to visit the “secret garden” on the Internet....
In fact, by coming in the morning to buy your ticket for the Palace we were able to obtain a ticket for the garden by not respecting the suggestions for guided tours in different languages since we can walk around on our own without following the tour organized in English , Korean..."
Pleasant palace to visit with a supplement you can visit a pretty garden it is also pleasant to meet visitors in traditional dress
"Cute and well kept but very similar to Gyeongbokgung Palace. Still, it's worth a visit. The garden must be booked in advance."
